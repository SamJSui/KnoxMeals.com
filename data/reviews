stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason B.,"New York, NY",8/15/2022,5.0,Great food great drinks awesome staff. I had the hurt locker and the toppings which were numerous were tastefully minimal but all there. On my list for Knoxville!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dave D.,"Rochester, MI",4/18/2022,5.0,"I stopped in Knoxville on a solo drive back to Michigan from Florida.  After 12 hours of driving, I was looking for a place where I could have a decent casual meal and a drink or two.  Other Yelp reviews caused me to pick this place.  I was lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar on a very crowded Friday night.  Lucky for me Sophie G. was tending bar that night and she made for a very pleasant evening.  She was friendly and approachable, as well as very knowledgeable about local craft beers and cocktail options.  She made me a couple great cocktails, including a recipe I provided.  She is a real asset to this restaurant.  Food wise, the salmon sandwich I ordered was also great, and the burgers I saw looked quite tasty.  If you are a burger person, this place would be a great fit.I'll definitely return if I'm lucky enough to be in Knoxville in the future, and hopefully Sophie will still be tending bar."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nicolle M.,"Boston, MA",8/22/2022,3.0,"Food quality isn't what it used to be. I was in town visiting Knoxville and figured I would go back to the old stomping ground of Stock and Barrel. I used to work in Market Square so I used to go to Stock & Barrel pretty frequently. The food wasn't as good as it used to be overall. The portions were still very generous and it's always a nice ambiance!! Village Tomato Salad -- This was the highlight of my meal! The salad is a perfectly orchestrated concoction of the right flavors and vegetables  coming together. The tomatoes, olives, feta, and onions are all great quality and feel fresh. You have to give this a try if you go in!! The Mother Clucker -- The sandwich was overall pretty under seasoned, and the garlic aioli was really trying to pull it all together but it fell short. The fries were a bit soggy, but still totally fine. Appreciated the amount of food, but we weren't too impressed.The Billy -- This sweet and salty burger wasn't for me. The meat wasn't flavorful and the quality wasn't great. The mix of the onions and tomato jam didn't mesh perfectly well in my opinion, but my friend who tried it really loved it. So while the toppings might not be for me, they might work well for you!I probably wouldn't go again, but it is undeniably a Market Square staple!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mrs J P.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",7/2/2022,1.0,"Food was ok, however the staff extremely immature and not attentive at all looked like a bunch of college kids lol, our waitress forgot a few things  like drink refils, she saw that but we had to ask once she returned, she forgot some food items so again we had to ask, when our waitress disappeared for a bit and she finally came back we had asked for our check snd waited on that, she also left our original empty drink glasses and as you know if you've been there some tables are small.Even the couple next to us, were complaining about there waitress who also disappeared on them as well lol Will we come back maybe but a different day and not on a Saturday night"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael B.,"Dayton, OH",6/13/2022,2.0,"The ambiance is great and the staff is good, especially the hostess. Drinks are pretty good as well. Unfortunately, it ends there. The food is subpar. All the hamburgers are over cooked. Well done when ordered medium. The buns on the burgers are not great. The billy burger comes with tomato jam. Good idea, but too sweet. It should be a Smokey tomato jam. Onions need to be more caramelized.The duck fat fries are overly soggy. Fried pickles are okay and the regular fries are good when you add salt.  Has potential, just needs a little focus on the details of the menu. Maybe it has lost something since it's opening."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeanette C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/18/2022,4.0,"My husband was craving a burger, so we came to Stock & Barrel. The burgers were huge and delicious! I thought my Greek Burger was better than The Bernie that my husband picked. The Greek Burger has a lamb patty with Kasseri cheese, tzatziki, greens, tomato, and bourbon onions. The flavor reminded me of eating a gyro, but in burger form. It was sooo tasty that I ate the burger the next day straight from the fridge (or, I was that hungry, haha)! The fries and onions rings were also great! You could tell they were made fresh with fresh ingredients. Next time, I want to try their crab dip and fried green tomatoes."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Hanna L.,"Christiana, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,So yummy! I got the Ring of Fire burger with regular fries and my husband got the Bison with duck fat fries. Both were delicious and the portions were huge! Neither of us was able to finish our meal. The garlic aioli sauce was delicious and I kept dipping my fries and burger in it. The Ring of Fire burger was definitely spicy (perfect for me but don't get it if you're sensitive to that stuff) and the Bison burger was delicious.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,M M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",9/8/2022,4.0,"Solid. Similar to Crow burger in Newport beach. Overpriced, but everything seems to be here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jacob N.,"Dayton, OH",7/22/2022,5.0,"My friend and I tried this place out while visiting Knoxville. Absolutely amazing! It was pretty busy but we were still seated right away. Our waiter was prompt and efficient and our drinks never ran dry!  The burgers came out fresh from the grill, still hot and juicy! The prices here were extremely reasonable as well. I 100% recommend this place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Susan L.,"North Ridgeville, OH",7/10/2022,3.0,"Stopped into Stock and Barrel on our one night trip to Knoxville. It had good Yelp reviews and my husband is a Bourbon fan. The food was excellent!  Very large portions and all delicious. Great choices for some interesting burgers. The service was fine for a busy Saturday night. This is getting a 3 because of the restrooms, which happened to be unisex. They were beyond atrocious.  The gas station we stopped at during our travel had cleaner facilities.  This was not just because it was busy kind of dirty. Honestly it made me nervous as the whole cleanliness of the place came into question. They were that bad.  But the food and bourbon were really good."
