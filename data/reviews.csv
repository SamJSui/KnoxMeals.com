stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason B.,"New York, NY",8/15/2022,5.0,Great food great drinks awesome staff. I had the hurt locker and the toppings which were numerous were tastefully minimal but all there. On my list for Knoxville!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dave D.,"Rochester, MI",4/18/2022,5.0,"I stopped in Knoxville on a solo drive back to Michigan from Florida.  After 12 hours of driving, I was looking for a place where I could have a decent casual meal and a drink or two.  Other Yelp reviews caused me to pick this place.  I was lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar on a very crowded Friday night.  Lucky for me Sophie G. was tending bar that night and she made for a very pleasant evening.  She was friendly and approachable, as well as very knowledgeable about local craft beers and cocktail options.  She made me a couple great cocktails, including a recipe I provided.  She is a real asset to this restaurant.  Food wise, the salmon sandwich I ordered was also great, and the burgers I saw looked quite tasty.  If you are a burger person, this place would be a great fit.I'll definitely return if I'm lucky enough to be in Knoxville in the future, and hopefully Sophie will still be tending bar."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nicolle M.,"Boston, MA",8/22/2022,3.0,"Food quality isn't what it used to be. I was in town visiting Knoxville and figured I would go back to the old stomping ground of Stock and Barrel. I used to work in Market Square so I used to go to Stock & Barrel pretty frequently. The food wasn't as good as it used to be overall. The portions were still very generous and it's always a nice ambiance!! Village Tomato Salad -- This was the highlight of my meal! The salad is a perfectly orchestrated concoction of the right flavors and vegetables  coming together. The tomatoes, olives, feta, and onions are all great quality and feel fresh. You have to give this a try if you go in!! The Mother Clucker -- The sandwich was overall pretty under seasoned, and the garlic aioli was really trying to pull it all together but it fell short. The fries were a bit soggy, but still totally fine. Appreciated the amount of food, but we weren't too impressed.The Billy -- This sweet and salty burger wasn't for me. The meat wasn't flavorful and the quality wasn't great. The mix of the onions and tomato jam didn't mesh perfectly well in my opinion, but my friend who tried it really loved it. So while the toppings might not be for me, they might work well for you!I probably wouldn't go again, but it is undeniably a Market Square staple!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mrs J P.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",7/2/2022,1.0,"Food was ok, however the staff extremely immature and not attentive at all looked like a bunch of college kids lol, our waitress forgot a few things  like drink refils, she saw that but we had to ask once she returned, she forgot some food items so again we had to ask, when our waitress disappeared for a bit and she finally came back we had asked for our check snd waited on that, she also left our original empty drink glasses and as you know if you've been there some tables are small.Even the couple next to us, were complaining about there waitress who also disappeared on them as well lol Will we come back maybe but a different day and not on a Saturday night"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael B.,"Dayton, OH",6/13/2022,2.0,"The ambiance is great and the staff is good, especially the hostess. Drinks are pretty good as well. Unfortunately, it ends there. The food is subpar. All the hamburgers are over cooked. Well done when ordered medium. The buns on the burgers are not great. The billy burger comes with tomato jam. Good idea, but too sweet. It should be a Smokey tomato jam. Onions need to be more caramelized.The duck fat fries are overly soggy. Fried pickles are okay and the regular fries are good when you add salt.  Has potential, just needs a little focus on the details of the menu. Maybe it has lost something since it's opening."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeanette C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/18/2022,4.0,"My husband was craving a burger, so we came to Stock & Barrel. The burgers were huge and delicious! I thought my Greek Burger was better than The Bernie that my husband picked. The Greek Burger has a lamb patty with Kasseri cheese, tzatziki, greens, tomato, and bourbon onions. The flavor reminded me of eating a gyro, but in burger form. It was sooo tasty that I ate the burger the next day straight from the fridge (or, I was that hungry, haha)! The fries and onions rings were also great! You could tell they were made fresh with fresh ingredients. Next time, I want to try their crab dip and fried green tomatoes."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Hanna L.,"Christiana, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,So yummy! I got the Ring of Fire burger with regular fries and my husband got the Bison with duck fat fries. Both were delicious and the portions were huge! Neither of us was able to finish our meal. The garlic aioli sauce was delicious and I kept dipping my fries and burger in it. The Ring of Fire burger was definitely spicy (perfect for me but don't get it if you're sensitive to that stuff) and the Bison burger was delicious.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jacob N.,"Dayton, OH",7/22/2022,5.0,"My friend and I tried this place out while visiting Knoxville. Absolutely amazing! It was pretty busy but we were still seated right away. Our waiter was prompt and efficient and our drinks never ran dry!  The burgers came out fresh from the grill, still hot and juicy! The prices here were extremely reasonable as well. I 100% recommend this place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,M M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",9/8/2022,4.0,"Solid. Similar to Crow burger in Newport beach. Overpriced, but everything seems to be here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Susan L.,"North Ridgeville, OH",7/10/2022,3.0,"Stopped into Stock and Barrel on our one night trip to Knoxville. It had good Yelp reviews and my husband is a Bourbon fan. The food was excellent!  Very large portions and all delicious. Great choices for some interesting burgers. The service was fine for a busy Saturday night. This is getting a 3 because of the restrooms, which happened to be unisex. They were beyond atrocious.  The gas station we stopped at during our travel had cleaner facilities.  This was not just because it was busy kind of dirty. Honestly it made me nervous as the whole cleanliness of the place came into question. They were that bad.  But the food and bourbon were really good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Melissa A.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/25/2022,5.0,"We'll this place is unbelievably great. If you want killer food, a fabulous whiskey selection and the best service, this is your place. We're giving it up to Ava our server, who hustles, is so friendly and impressive. She made our experience great! We loved every minute of Stock and Barrel thanks to Ava."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah M.,"Memphis, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,"I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. This is my all time favorite place to eat. The best burgers, fries, onion rings & shakes in town. I always get the Elvis with half fries & half onion rings."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jill B.,"Knoxville, TN",3/20/2022,5.0,We arrived tonight before a show we were going to at the Tennessee Theatre and they said the wait was 15-30 minutes unless we wanted to sit at the bar.  Fortunately there were 2 seats at the bar so we were able to be seated quickly.  We ordered shortly afterward and got our food within a reasonable time frame.I ordered the Shroom Burger and my husband got the Steakhouse burger.  I got the onion rings and he got fries. You get like 5 onion rings and a ginormous pile of fries when you order them as the side.We ate our burgers and the onion rings and less than half of the fries.  We both ordered our burgers medium but realized we should have ordered them medium well since they actually were medium. Ha.  Usually we order the lesser option because most places over cook their meat.  It was good and the bartenders were nice and service was pretty quick.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Laura D.,"Portland, OR",9/8/2022,5.0,"Great service, great ambiance and great food. Note: The only way to make a reservation is to get on the wait list via the yelp app, so be sure to do that otherwise you'll be waiting 60-90mins putting your name in upon arrival."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Corissa L.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",3/8/2022,3.0,"The Fried Dill Pickles were yummy and addictive. When they came out, we thought that that there was no way we were going to finish them, but there were only a few left when we were done. So my 3-star review is primarily based on my husband's assessment of the burger, which he said wasn't that great. Edible, but definitely one of the best burgers he's had. And trust me, he eats a lot of burgers. He left me a bit to try, but it was cold by then, so definitely wasn't great. I was trying to eat lighter, so I had the Wedge Salad. It was good, but nothing special. And salads aren't really the reason why you would visit this place. I will have to say that the server and management were great. They accidentally put dressing on my salad when I asked for it on the side. I said it was fine, but they offered to charge me 1/2 price for the salad, which was service-oriented and we appreciated."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Danielle H.,"Hilliard, OH",6/8/2022,3.0,"I'm going to start by saying I've been here many times and the food is amazing! Here is my issue, we went today at 4:30pm, party of 8. Four adults, four kids. The restaurant was not busy. We asked to be seated together, obviously, and we were informed that there were no two tables open with the same server. Okay, so switch tables with servers while we are there eating. I served for many years through high school and college, this didn't seem like a difficult request. My mangers told us who we were serving, they didn't ask us. That didn't seem to be an option. This might be the worst case of customer service I've seen. I've attached pictures of how we sat, as a family, for lunch. If I owned this establishment, I'd be talking to my manager about what customer service looks like. I'm very disappointed in a place I really used to love."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Noah R.,"Downtown, Nashville, TN",9/3/2022,5.0,Some of the best burgers and a great atmosphere. A good to in Knoxville we just love it!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Adriana F.,"Sparta Township, NJ",7/27/2022,5.0,"I came here with my husband for lunch on a rainy Monday afternoon. It was crowded, but the hostess seated us promptly at one of the last open tables. Right off the bat, I loved the vibe and energy of this place with its lit up, lively bar. I also liked the modern, brightly painted portraits of famous people decorating the walls. Our waitress took our drink order right away and was very attentive during our whole lunch. My husband and I were dying to try their burgers. I got The Shroomin' burger and my hubby got the Classic Bacon. You can really taste the difference with the Mitchell Family beef that they use for their burgers. This was hands down, one of my favorite burgers of all time. It was perfectly cooked and topped with sautéed mushrooms and a creamy horseradish sauce. If you're a mushroom fan like me, then The Shroomin' burger is for you. In addition to their amazing burgers, they have an extensive selection of bourbons and whiskeys. So, if you like burgers and bourbon/whiskey plus a lively atmosphere, Stock & Barrel will surely not disappoint."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lauren Q.,"Knoxville, TN",8/8/2022,5.0,"One of my favorite burger places in town! Went for lunch with hubby and dogs on 8/8 and had a lovely server girl Dana(?). The Elvis burger with blueberry jam is always my fave, hubby gets the hurt locker - - always upgrade your side to duck fat fries! One of these times we'll try a delicious looking milkshake"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeff G.,"Glen Carbon, IL",6/3/2022,4.0,"Fantastic bourbon selection. I haven't seen this broad of a selection in a long time. If bourbon is not your game the old fashioned is very good- whoops, that's bourbon! My wife enjoyed a couple of the other mixed drinks- sorry, I'm a bourbon fan. Lol We ate dinner. The farmhouse burger was very good. My wife enjoyed thr Billy burger. This place was crowded on a Thursday night if that tells you anything about its popularity. The service was excellent."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bao N.,"San Jose, CA",5/14/2022,3.0,"3.5 stars... It was fine. Was not bad, not great. I would recommend not paying extra for duck fat fries. I quite enjoy duck fat, but unfortunately, for the duck fat fries, you get no duck fat flavor.It might not be their fault. Ducks are on a diet or something? I hear on the streets that chicks are cutting for their summer bod. Duck show soon? Staying tuned."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chris A.,"Orlando, FL",12/19/2021,5.0,"Every time I visit a new city, I synthesize data that I gather from multiple websites. Just because a restaurant is rated highly on one list doesn't mean it is on other lists. I try and find the restaurant that is most widely accepted as the best, and when I was preparing for my Knoxville trip, Stock & Barrel was that #1 spot. It was universally loved by many different people on many different sites. So, of course I had to check it out. One of things I kept hearing about were the Duck Fat Fries (Rendered Duck Fat + Grated Parmesan + Scallions + Garlic Aioli). I've had duck fat fries before, pretty good ones, so I had to compare. These were better, much better. The duck fat adds another depth of flavor to the fries. It's impossible to describe, but it activates another spot on your tongue and makes you go yum. You'll just have to try these to find out. Easily the most appealing starter on their menu. I also got to share another starter, the Spicy Crab Dib (Lump Crab + Roasted Red Pepper + Pepper Jack + Cream Cheese + Cajun Spices + Scallions + Dusted Pita Chips). Large chunks of lump crab; all you need to know. A nice mix of flavors in the creamy dip, not too spicy. And the pita chips were perfectly crispy. I rationed them and asked for a few more. Solid dish.Then, I got to my burger. There are many different options, and they all sound differently unique, and they all sound delicious. I ended up choosing The Bernie (Mitchell Family Beef + Blue Cheese Crumbles + Benton's Bacon + Blueberry Preserve + Beer Battered Jalapeños). Sounds a little interesting, but the flavors matched up well, the funky cheese, the sweet preserve, and the spicy jalapenos. It all comes together into a fun little burger. I was pleased. And it was all served on a high quality bun that they didn't just get from a mass distributor. Oh, and their onions rings were perfect. Very crispy, and a hefty onion ring inside. Heaven. This place was heaven. Overall, out of everything I ate in this little part of Tennessee, I could see why this place got so much love. They offer a ton of great stuff, and it all seems to be high quality. The next time I'm in town, I'll gladly come to gorgeous downtown Knoxville and check this place out again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",12/23/2021,1.0,"Food wise and selection of spirits deserved more stars. But how I was treated at end of my experience left me feeling disturbed and one of the worst experiences leaving an establishment. I did not catch my bartender's name. But she was a younger woman that worked the day shift on December 23, 2021. I came in and asked about the cocktail and Rye selection. She offered a Johnie Walker Rye addition that sparked my interest. There wasn't that much left in the bottle and the pour came out to an ounce. She said she'd knock two dollars off since did not come out to a full pour. Had the chicken sandwich for lunch, and after my shot had a brew.  Meanwhile the bartender was spending most the time stocking, and not actually paying attention to customers. At the end when I tabbed out my bill did not reflect a discount of two dollars. I mentioned to her what she noted, then she said she'd fixed and give 10% off which wasn't $2, instead $1.45. Change is whatever, but I mentioned to her calmly she didn't hold up to what she had said. She gave me a discussed look, got change out of register, gave me my bill and said the change should cover it. Then immediately walked away. Ok chill. Appreciate the food and selection, not a great customer service experience. Left me feeling ill."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matt R.,"Knoxville, TN",12/22/2021,5.0,"Great restaurant. I've been to Stock & Barrel twice already and each time I've been very satisfied with my experience. The place is small but I've never had an issue getting a table, even with a party of 7!The staff are all very friendly and helpful and give great recommendations. I would definitely recommend the onion rings instead of fries as they are delicious and one of the best I've tasted. They also have lots of selection on their menu so everyone can find something they will enjoy. I will definitely be returning here"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dennis L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/29/2022,4.0,"Guys--seriously--just go here. Honestly, I haven't been by in about a year. The food / environment are just as good as my first time soon after they opened a few years ago. Crafted / elevated burgers...a deep bourbon list...and old faithful fresh cut fries or breaded onion rings as chasers...they nail it all. I will say this--be sore to use the Yelp check-in feature or you will wait on line for a few days (maybe a couple of hours) around peak times. This is a small shop but it also speaks to the perpetual popularity of a place that has become a staple on Market Square. Try the Hurt Locker Burger. Yep, you read that correctly."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brooke H.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2022,5.0,"This is tiny place with awesome burgers and strong drinks.  I had dinner with my parents here last week and we enjoyed fried green tomatoes to start, burgers for our main, and a variety of creative cocktails.  Everything was memorable and delicious.  The only down sound is that it is very loud inside.  When the weather is nicer, I'll opt for an outside table."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ellen K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3/30/2022,4.0,"Very popular choice in Market Square in downtown Knoxville, Tennessee. There is a parking garage around the corner that is free on weekends and weeknights.  There are a few high top tables and a pair of regular tables out front with heat lamps is where we sat.  Inside was packed on the Monday night we were there for dinner before sunset. The portion size was very filling.  The burger bun was baked perfectly. The old fashion drink was well prepared. I can see why it's so popular, bourbon and burgers at their best."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michelle C.,"NY, NY",8/1/2022,5.0,Fast and friendly service. Burgers cooked to perfection. Onion rings were the way they should be! Great dinner!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jaden B.,"Fountain City, Knoxville, TN",7/30/2022,3.0,4 burgers and some fried pickles it was 90 bucks and the burgers were not that great but the pickles were amazing and I'm definitely going to make a trip next time just to go get the pickles and they were quite busy but the restaurant is small and I barely seen our server
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Melanie H.,"Navarre, FL",8/26/2022,3.0,"Not great. Made a reservation, and still had to wait 30 minutes after checking in with the host. The restaurant is extremely loud, so it's hard to have a conversation or hear your server. The food was amazing though...probably the best burger in Knoxville. However, the service and atmosphere was so bad, I don't think I'll go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lesley B.,"Knoxville, TN",9/6/2022,1.0,We had a reservation and they still wanted us to wait 30-45 minutes when we checked in (at our reservation tine) and the place next store (not watsons) was awesome and sat us right away. What is the point of a reservation?
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rodney W.,"Farmers Branch, TX",1/14/2022,4.0,"Great bar!  Elle was a rockstar bartender. We had the schroomin burger and duck fat fries. It was all incredible. Also had a Greek tomato salad that was reallyGood. Good drinks, good food, good vibes. It's all here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lucy R.,"Miami, FL",5/14/2022,5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE these kind of restaurants ! Simple, rustic decor. Happy go lucky, but incredibly efficient staff with a fun burger menu and outstanding back bar. Desserts were fantastic!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Justin H.,"Knoxville, TN",1/23/2022,4.0,"I have heard people raving about Stock & Barrel for some time now.  One of my neighbors even told me it was the best burger he'd ever had.  So, I went in with high expectations.  Burger-wise:   I think the menu is fairly unique.  They use local meat (Mitchell Farm, if I remember correctly) and have some interesting combinations.  I chose the ""ring of fire"" burger.  It was pretty darned hot because of the habanero.  So, it wasn't a watered down version.  My wife had one with goat cheese and tomato jam.  She liked it fairly well also.  Likes:   They have local meats, bacon, and high quality ingredients.  Gluten free buns are an option too.  Dislikes:  Fries were very weak.  I've had better ones at fast food.  Also, the burger wasn't all that flavorful.  It wasn't particularly well seasoned or grilled.  So, I wouldn't rank it as best in town.  What's better you may ask?  For one, I think MOOYAH is.  Red Robin might be as well. I also found the menu a little bit limited.  It's burgers.  Not a lot else.  Overall:  Pretty good.  A solid B for me.  I would come here if I was downtown and my dinner companions are burger people.  However, it isn't on the level of being a destination -- the type of place that draws me back because the food is awesome."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Esther B.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",3/24/2022,5.0,This place was found while driving and we got hungry and needs some eats ---we did great and everything was tasty and we loved the downtown vibe . We will be back when we are on the road once again.Thanks Stock & Barrell
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Noel A.,"Jamestown, NC",6/30/2021,5.0,We chose stock and barrel because they are listed In the top 10 in Knoxville. What we didn't know is we'd have our dogs with us. The dogs were welcomed with open arms. Now the food:  the food was delicious. Service was fantastic.Hannah was very conversational and suggested a bourbon that was absolutely delicious.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cassi M.,"Knoxville, TN",12/29/2021,5.0,"This is my favorite place to get onion rings from hands down! My husband loves the burgers and I love the chicken sandwiches or chicken and waffle sandwich, but the onion rings are a must! I always order 2 extra side orders, they are just that good lol. I have also had their wedge salad which was really good as well. They even have a tomato salad that is a good side if you like something lighter. Honestly we have never been disappointed with anything we have gotten from here"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Melanie C.,"Tallahassee, FL",4/27/2022,4.0,"I'm always nervous to try places that seem to have rave reviews on every single site when visiting a new city but this one lived up to the reviews. We have been traveling for a few days and our diets have been less than stellar so we knew we need something more real, glad we tried this place and would visit again. Had the heirloom tomato salad with chicken and it was KILLER! The fried green tomatoes were good/okay but as mentioned in my previous reviews I'm a fried green tomato snob. The service was great, bartender was great, vibe was great, beers were great."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Wade W.,"Aldie, VA",9/4/2022,5.0,Best burgers you will ever have. Go here way too often. only complaint is that food occasionally takes a little long to come out. Is always worth the wait too. Fried pickles and their onion rings are also amazing.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley B.,"Clinton, TN",5/5/2022,5.0,Never had a bad experience here. Burgers and fries are top of the line. I've been to 33 states and I don't know of a better place for a burger
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Casey I.,"Clinton, TN",9/4/2022,5.0,"Best Burgers in downtown Knoxville! The Duck Fat Fries are also quite tasty. If you're looking for a great experience, look no further."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alicia S.,"OH, OH",7/13/2021,5.0,"Not that Stock & Barrel really needs anyone else to rave about their restaurant, but it's not going to stop me. :)We've been to S&B on many occasions over the past several years having lived in Knoxville in the past, and we recently at their for the first time in six years. Sometimes, I'm really glad things don't change. Their food was still just as good as I remember it. Having lived in states from Texas to cities like Chicago, I can honestly say that their burgers rank in my top two!This past Sunday, we had the Black & Blue and the Bernie. Both are interesting burgers with high-quality ingredients that you just won't get anywhere else. I definitely recommend trying something outside of the box in your visit. You won't regret it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,CL R.,"Murrieta, CA",8/18/2022,4.0,"Great wait staff, mixed drinks and burgers. Fries...not so much. A little loud if you're noise sensitive."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tim O.,"Chicago, IL",4/30/2022,5.0,I ordered a burger and a milkshake and enjoyed both items.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Buck S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7/14/2022,5.0,"Great burgers, great fries. Right in market square. Great place to grab a bite to eat with new or old friends. Full bar."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Salmaan T.,"Washington, DC",7/12/2022,5.0,"Still the best burger in Knoxville. Beefy burger, fresh ingredients, super tasty. Hasn't been since covid pandemic but it's just as good as before. The toppings were as much as the burger. Loved it. Will definitely be back!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Emily S.,"Johnson City, TN",4/27/2022,5.0,"Such an amazing place to eat. We traveled from Johnson City, TN and just had to give it a try since my husband and I love bourbon and burgers. The bison burger was one of the best burgers ive had in forever, and the bourbon selection was excellent. I also must mention that the bartender was above and beyond great and we really appreciated his passion with making drinks and talking about the different bourbon options. We will most definitely be back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paula K.,"Bloomingdale, GA",6/21/2022,5.0,"Excellent service and the best burgers, fries, and onion rings.  The best part was you can get a half order of fries and a half order of rings.  I ordered the Hurt Locker.  I wish Ibwould have ordered a bowl of that in house made pimento cheese with a kick and an order of them fried green tomatoes but it was also fantastic stacked up on my burger with bacon and bourbon onions.  This is a must try burger if you like pimento cheese!  Great fries and rings.  But that service with a smile was the best.  Very helpful when deciding what to order.  I will be back on my next trip to Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amber S.,"Los Angeles, CA",10/30/2021,5.0,"Came here as a pit stop around 3 pm on a Monday on my way to Nashville and was seated immediately at the bar. I got the $7 duck fat fries, which was delicious and a good serving size! You can definitely taste the duck fat, which I appreciated. The sauce had a mustard flavor to it, which was nice to mix up the palette a bit, though you could definitely eat the fries alone. Would love to come back and try the burgers in the future!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Noel D.,"Knoxville, TN",7/1/2022,5.0,"Great place, limited seating but fantastic burgers. Definitely recommend trying if you're in the area visiting."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amy F.,"Southlake, TX",4/9/2022,5.0,Did the Yelp check in and seated early! 10/10 burgers and shakes!!! Small place but efficient w seating and getting food out! Had the Farmhouse (egg and bacon) and the American w gluten free bun! This place is worth it!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Randill D.,"Columbia, SC",6/19/2022,5.0,"Good vibes, large portions and in the heart of downtown. Selection of bourbon is what brought this review to 5 stars!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lundy P.,"Miami Lakes, FL",6/26/2022,4.0,Food was really good as was the service. Only issues were lack of available seating and the menu could be a little more extensive to include some entrees. Otherwise good experience!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alex G.,"Knoxville, TN",3/20/2021,3.0,Solid atmosphere. We sat outside which was really cool. The burger with pimento cheese is solid. The bread was kind of dry. Aioli fries were super greasy. Overall service was great - the food is just okay. We got the fired pickles as an app - super greasy as well. I would go back but not if I'm in the mood for anything remotely healthy.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike W.,"Murrieta, CA",5/8/2022,5.0,"Unmatched burgers and a cool bar area equates to an always solid experience at S&B. Their choice to feature local beef from Mitchell Farms is brilliant. Apps and sides are generous in portions and tasty. Will be back as there are some innovative burger options to try; yummy!They have a great selection of bourbon and whiskey as well, be sure to whet your whistle ;)"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gregg H.,"Zeeland, MI",3/21/2022,4.0,"This is a really cool place to stop for some pretty good bar food and a drink in Market Square in Knoxville, TN. The real attraction is the impressive bourbon list. If your a fan, this is an important stop! The service is very good and the staff is really friendly. But, really, the bourbon is the highlight here. I'll make it a stop again when I'm in town."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kassi S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/2/2022,3.0,"Pretty great burger overall but I was very disappointed with the fries , we ordered the duck fat fries and when our food came out they were supper greasy and not hot at all, I would say some of them were actually cold. The fired mushrooms were really tasty but I would definitely ask for extra honey drizzle because without that they are kind of one note and plain. The service could have been a little better, seemed to take forever to get our drinks originally but it got a little better after we orders. Over all it was an ok meal. I would get a burger there again but not the fries"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel G.,"Nashville, TN",5/1/2021,4.0,Great Service! Super friendly bartender/ manager.The burger was delicious. I went with a Shroomin that horseradish sauce was amazing! The fries were just ok. I tried a local beer recommended by the bartender. It went great with the burger. TONS of options on barrel items! Definitely lives up to the hype!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather R.,"Knoxville, TN",3/10/2022,3.0,"3.5 starsThis was one of may favorite places to go in Knoxville. At one point i would say, exceeded the hype. Even when you waited hours for a table and then longer for food, it was always worth it. The food is still good. The service is may be better (that may be due to business not being what it used to). I feel like the burger patty size got smaller. When it is loaded up with the various delicious toppings, a smaller patty skews the ratio of toppings to meat. Today i had a Black and Blue. It was just salt. Salty patty, salty bacon, salty onion strings and no sign of the blue. Fries and onion rings still great. Another disappointment is the Bison burger. At 17-18$, no longer has the duck fat fries. Great beer selection even better bourbon selection. There are at least 10 places in town for a better burger now. I don't see me returning unless at someone else's request at this point."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather R.,"Knoxville, TN",4/20/2016,5.0,"I have been here many times. I am never disappointed. I could go on about the craft cocktails and beer selection, but let's be honest, it is about the food. I have had a couple of their apps which were good but a vague memory. The main attraction is the burger. I say my favorite is the Black and Blue until I have a Hurt Locker again. Last time I had the Bison with Bousin cheese, mushrooms and fried onions. It's now my favorite...until I go back and have something just as amazing. The fries are also some of the best I have ever had. Regular or duck confit. I  have never been brave enough to have dessert or a milk shake, only becasue I feel like someone needs to carry out after the burger and fries alone. Last words, believe the hype."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Debi L.,"Carrollton, TX",6/9/2022,4.0,Cool place.  If you love whiskey you'll be in heaven.   If you like good hamburgers you'd be in heaven.  I totally recommend this place.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jenna W.,"Knoxville, TN",3/12/2022,2.0,"The vibe is super fun. Love the atmosphere but we can totally pass on the food. Fries and appetizer were great, burgers were mediocre at best. Flavor was bland, burger was way undercooked and we felt sick afterwards. This was our second time giving S&B a shot and it leaves us wondering what all the hype is about."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jay S.,"Dallas, TX",7/23/2021,3.0,"Sometimes it can be tough living up to expectations. With a lot of people screaming from the rooftops about Stock & Barrel, I was expecting greatness. Unfortunately, S&B fell short. To begin with, I felt like the place is understaffed. The wait staff seemed to be having trouble keeping up with the demands of their tables and it showed on their collective faces. Our own waitress went AWOL a few times and I was tempted to ask a different waitress for assistance but then I got that 'I'm not your f*in server' look and I thought the better of it. A quick rundown: The Farmhouse (bacon, egg, cheese) went over well (7/10); the Bison (boursin, fried onions) was very good (8/10) although the much acclaimed duckConfit fries tasted identical to the regular fries (6/10); the Elvis (peanut butter, fried banana, bacon) was inedible (1/10) primarily due to the fact that the bananas were tasteless mush; and the kid's cheeseburger (2/10) seemed to be cut from a different quality of beef as it was very dense and tasteless. The onion rings (5/10) were adequate. The S'mores milkshakes (9/10),were epic though, as was the peanut butter pie (8/10)."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dawn T.,"Irvine, CA",7/15/2022,5.0,We are working our way through the menu and so far the food is amazing everytime. Staff is also very friendly. We look forward to visiting every Friday night.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Greg M.,"Strongsville, OH",1/25/2022,5.0,"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try for lunch.  Had the Carburetor salad.  Most interesting salad I've ever had.  More of an open faced burger.  Fried burger patty with pickles, red onion, cherry tomatoes and bacon atop a bed of fresh greens with thousand island dressing.  I'm here to tell you, it was fantastic!  Never had pickles on a salad before, but this was outstanding.  Paired it with a local IPA which was delicious.  Friendly and fast service as well.  Great place."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Donald R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/3/2021,4.0,"Our second time here. It's very small with limited seating, so it's tough to get in on the weekends without calling ahead. But, the bar accommodates a lot of people, and that's open seating. We were seated right away on this Sunday early evening. Their whiskey collection is impressive. And for those who don't like spirits, they have a selection of wine and draft beers. My wife had the Cabernet. I had Jefferson's Reserve. We shared the big chicken sandwich and substituted for the duck fat fries. Yummy!  The sandwich was giant and easy to share. It was cooked tender without too much breading. The place was busy but the service was very good. We will definitely return again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sam H.,"Blue Bell, PA",3/6/2021,5.0,"One damn great burger and fries. The farmhouse has an over easy egg on a deliciously prepped burger and cheddar cheese. With the aioli sauce and the duck fat fries, I died and went to heaven.The burger was juicy and flavorful. And when I bit into the yolk, the burger became more very and flavorful.  Although I prefer my fries well done, these fries were pliable but were very flavorful from the duck fat.If you want a great burger and fries, you really need to eat here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessica M.,"Franklin, TN",7/31/2021,5.0,"Fantastic location right in the Market Square. Our party of six were seated immediately on a Thursday evening. Everything we ordered was delicious including the Elvis burger: banana, peanut butter, bacon (don't knock it until you've tried it!) We will definitely be back for more on our next trip to Knoxville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Marette S.,"TN, TN",8/5/2022,5.0,The best burgers in town.  The onion rings are even better.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rebecca C.,"Greensboro, NC",6/1/2022,5.0,Best burgers in existence. Long wait and completely worth it. Get on the wait list on Yelp! That helped tremendously.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Josh R.,"Dallas, TX",7/6/2021,5.0,"We were passing through Knoxville, and this was the top rated restaurant. It did not disappoint!!! We started with the fried pickles which were amazing. I ordered The Ring of Fire Burger. It was delicious and so were the fries! The staff was friendly. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I recommend this place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cassie L.,"Indianapolis, IN",4/14/2022,5.0,"Stock and Barrel has been my favorite burger place for several years! They don't take reservations, but the wait is always worth it. The bar is seat yourself, so definitely check there for open spots. A huge bar selection is available too. Several different burger options to choose from and even a chicken sandwich and black bean option. Burgers come with fries, onion rings, or a mix. Closest parking is Market Square garage."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Angie W.,"Knoxville, TN",6/26/2021,4.0,Showed up 7ish on a Friday night. About a two hour wait so we walked around. Stopped on an hour later and there was space at the bar so we lucked out. Bar service was a bit sloppy but they were nice. Got our drinks but no one came back to take food order. Finally got someone's eye and got appetizers in but when they came no silverware and no plates. Asked twice for water. They were busy but wasn't crazy. Food was overall good. Fried green tomatoes with goat cheese and balsamic was great. I got the salmon burger which was hard to eat as you couldn't pick up and keep it all together. Onion rings were cold but ate them as figured kitchen was busy. Partner had the burger which they said was good but also disappointed in the rings. Nice whiskey selection. Reasonable prices. Might give it another go on at a less busy time.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gonzo P.,"Apollo Beach, FL",1/15/2022,4.0,"Wow!!!!!Recommended by a work client that knew I was not big on burgers but thirsty A.F. for liquor.I took the crew and had an amazing time.The staff really made us all feel welcome and at home as did the rustic downtown atmosphere. Clean, friendly, artsy, accommodating and intimate.Americana at its best!The delicious mushroom appetizers could have been a meal in itself although not so much with the crab dip.You want a burger? Well burgers all they gots!Feeling experimental I went for the Bison burger. Sautéed mushrooms, crispy onions and some kind of sauce. Holey smokes!!!!Makes my mouth water a week later, still in bed writing this review!!!!!!!It's a full bar, burger joint on steroids. With over 20 something burgers including veggie and bean burgers. Next time ill try the ""Big Nasty""There's a burger for every picky eater.Bring your appetite."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Andrew C.,"St. Charles, MO",8/12/2022,2.0,Hire competent bartenders. I came here specifically for an old fashioned. Served me one without a cherry. So much for southern hospitality.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert F.,"Gray, TN",5/1/2022,4.0,I aways hit this place up when I'm in town.  Super chill with a great bourbon list.  Burgers are great and the staff is friendly.  If you like bourbon and burgers hit this place up
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Fritz F.,"TN, TN",4/18/2022,1.0,"The bourbon list is phenomenal. The burgers are great. I recommend the Billy thus far.  I was a bit put off when a lady brought her dog that was not a service animal into the restaurant. I spoke with the manager that just so happened to pet and show the dog off to the bartender working that night. She did not do her job. I was reluctant to still pay for all of my food given my experience was totally ruined by someone's pure entitlement of ""I take my toy dog anywhere I want."" The dog was not on a leash, being carried and not identified with a vest but had a very cute Easter fit on. Clearly, not a working service animal yet they took advantage of the ""can't ask""' rule. Management failed horribly."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Beth M.,"Greensboro, NC",5/12/2021,3.0,"Honestly, it is just okay; we should have tried the sister restaurant, Chivo Taqueria, instead. We waited an hour for an outdoor table on a beautiful Friday evening, and the wait was no problem at all (and it was graduation weekend!); service was fast, but food was mediocre. The Opa! appetizer was memorable - really liked the honey drizzle, but the menu says feta cheese and it definitely was not feta...had to be halloumi. I don't discriminate amongst cheese, so I was happy with whatever it was, but it was not feta so don't be fooled. The Elvis burger was way too sweet (too much peanut butter and thankfully the bananas were not deep fried, but overall too sweet). Maybe I just ordered poorly, which is very possible!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Macy D.,"TN, TN",11/21/2021,4.0,"We went to Stock & Barrel recently for dinner downtown. We know they are known for their burgers, and after waiting on the waitlist for an hour, we were so hungry and ready for some food! We got the crab dip as an appetizer, which was just okay. The pita crackers they were served with tasted warm and fresh, but the dip itself was so runny it was almost more like a soup. The flavor was good though! I got a wedge salad (needed something light after beer hopping downtown), and it was very good! My boyfriend got the spicy mac and cheese special burger which he really enjoyed. We upgraded his side from regular fries to duck fat fries, but unfortunately our waitress forgot to put the order in, so they didn't arrive until we were almost done with our meal. We also each got drinks. They have a very extensive whiskey menu, but I had been drinking wine & beer all day so steered clear of the whiskies. I started with the rosé (there was only one on the menu)...I do not recommend. Syrupy sweet and tasted like a cherry moscato of sorts. I switched to Prosecco after that which was much more enjoyable. My boyfriend got the featured old fashioned (maple pecan) and then a regular old fashioned, and he liked both of his drinks. I would recommend the burgers for sure and would likely order one next time I go, and the duck fat fries were amazing. I think we likely caught an off night for the servers/kitchen, but would love to go back for more fries and to try one of the many burgers!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jonathan B.,"Vista East, Orlando, FL",3/18/2022,4.0,"Visited this restaurant as a dinner stop on our way to Georgia off of a yelp suggestion. For a burger place, not bad. Burgers were good but for the price I would say average is a more accurate of an assessment. While not too impressed with the burgers, was very impressed with the quality of service we received. From the front of house, to our waitress, and servers we were treated kindly and with appreciation. If I come back through Knoxville I would try a few other restaurants within the square first, but definitely enjoyed our experience. P.S. If you go and the weather is nice would definitely suggest sitting outside, very lively town square to look out on while you eat."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jodi M.,"Portage, MI",4/9/2022,2.0,"I had eaten here once before and it was good enough to return. But this time it was bad! My husband ordered the Greek burger and I had the "" Mercian"". I ordered it medium/ med rare. It took awhile to get, and it took awhile to get someone to a knowledge that we were there in the first place . The burger bun was dry and crusty and my burger was WELL done , not a single drop of juice. The fries were old like they were the bottom of the batch and far from warm. The whole experience was a let down ! The search for a good burger continues"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Snejana P.,"Spring City, PA",7/24/2022,5.0,"Excellent food!  We got The Bernie burger & The Mother Clucker fried chicken sandwich.  Both were huge!  Really great flavor, nice service & a lot of food for your money.   Definitely recommend!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Terry M.,"Des Plaines, IL",10/18/2020,4.0,"Small burger restaurant in downtown Knoxville. The atmosphere was perfect, the service great, and the food incredible. The 4 stars instead of 5 isn't because I'm a snob or an asshat in general (some may argue based on other reviews), but simply because of limited menu variety.Don't get me wrong, these people can make a burger sing a capella, but its only burgers and some very, very good sides. And, an incredible whiskey selection. My wife and I split a Rim of Fire burger that was  plenty hot but with tons of flavor. We also had the duck fries (highly recommend) and the village tomato salad which was the best part of the meal.Cool vibe and location. Great food. And it didn't stress my Visa card--very affordable. Go get 'em, Tiger."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jefferson L.,"Las Vegas, NV",11/30/2021,5.0,"So while in town for Thanksgiving and rivalry weekend, the Vols fans were out in force in Market Square. Regardless, we were able to get a table within a reasonable amount of time at Stock and Barrel. We walked the square and no other restaurants seemed to have the kind of activity that was going on at Stock and Barrel. After our wait, we were seated inside, party of four, and our server took our order. Started with the Fried Green Tomatoes, a nice blend of sweet and savory to get the taste buds going, and a round of cocktails. I specifically had the Nor'Easter which was comparable to a Moscow Mule plus bourbon in the mix. This was a fantastic take on the drink and I would absolutely order it again, then two or three more. We also order the Gringo and the Chivo. The Gringo was mighty strong so if you're looking for a smoother start, this might not be for you. The Chivo was similar to a top shelf Margarita and just as good. For our main course, we had the Black and Blue, the Steakhouse Burger and the Bison. Mine specifically, the Steakhouse was riddled with a nice mix of A1, crispy onions and mushrooms. All three burgers were cooked to perfection and the sides were also killer. Two orders of onion rings and a side of house made fries. I get the hype, and I would like to know if anyone out there in the Yelp universe knows a better burger in Knoxville. This one is tough to beat."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Carolyn C.,"Brookhaven West, Oklahoma City, OK",6/4/2022,4.0,Nice casual place to eat in Knoxville. Good food too. Wouldn't recommend the duck fat fries but I would totally recommend the mother clucker and tomato salad. Bison burger was ok too with the Mac & cheese.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David F.,"Fitchburg, WI",11/13/2021,2.0,"Lock stock and one not so smoking grill. My bison burger, ordered medium, came out redder than a Tennessee fan after the 2012 pike fraternity press conference. Was scoffed at when asking if the outdoor space heaters worked, and then they didn't work. Thought that was maybe why the burger was a little cold, but after a few bites I realized something else. AVOID"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Pit V.,"TN, TN",6/13/2022,5.0,I ordered this as a gift for my brother's birthday and the entire family enjoyed it. It was very gourmet and much better than eating in a restaurant. The size of each entree is very generous and they enjoyed one every day making it a fun celebration. They couldn't decide which one was their favorite. I have now ordered the three-day entree for my nephew's birthday. Each one of the entrees is delicious and made with fresh ingredients. Delish indeed!!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,w. W.,"TN, TN",6/13/2022,5.0,"The first time after years I felt the ""welcome to Stock & barrel"" greeting at this place & I said in my heart ""well Mr. first CEO returned with his principles"". I read his books, but for the many Starbucks doors I entered in the founder's story in the book & the practice at most Starbucks were totally different. I'm very excited to experience as the book stories. Keep the warm tradition. Get going!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Autum V.,"TN, TN",6/2/2022,3.0,"Service here was excellent, however, the food was subpar. The Farmhouse and Billy burgers were nothing special. The onion rings were about as good as what you'd get at Sonic. The place is very cramped and makes  you feel like you're a part of all the nearby conversations. On a positive note, the drink selection is pretty good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Micah K.,"Fulton, NY",4/8/2022,4.0,"This place has a really cute aesthetic, from the twinkle lights and the wooden furniture to the wall of liquor and all burger menu. We got the bacon, diehard, and chicken&waffles burgers and they were al great. The plant based patty on the diehard wasn't the best but it was good enough. The one thing that kind of killed it for me was the tvs. I get the whole ""sports bar"" thing and I think broadcasting sports games, especially local games(Go Vols!), is a great way to attract customers and connect with the community but I find it distracting."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ivy L.,"TN, TN",8/3/2022,5.0,"Very good!!! I've heard great things about this place, and have never been disappointed. You honestly can't go wrong with anything you order"

We tried stock & barrel and we are so glad we did! Great atmosphere, the staff was SO warm and helpful, and the food is the best I've had in a while (and probably my favorite burger I've ever had period)."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Aaron W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/9/2022,5.0,"Giant sized, loaded up, fresh made burgers. I usually get the one with the egg on top. Always tastes great, I guess the proof is that they've been in business a long time and I keep going back. Expensive but a treat! Recommend"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jake M.,"Minooka, IL",5/21/2022,3.0,"The burgers are very good, the atmosphere is the issue. The tables are so close to one another, you are bumping elbows with the party next to you. If you can get in at a slow time go, otherwise I would say it is not worth it"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kaleigh K.,"MI, MI",5/20/2022,5.0,"Great vibe, great food! The chicken practically melted in my mouth. It was a wonderful experience."

Suggestion...the deep fried pickles were fantastic as well and worth the appetizer purchase!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Krystal N.,"Memphis, TN",3/1/2021,5.0,"Cannot rave about this place enough. Their duck fat fries are phenomenal!!! Also a must try is their crab dip. Creamy seafood goodness. Their burgers are yummy and big. Onion rings are crispy and big. Would highly recommend, even to go the food doesn't lose its flavor or texture."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Izzy T.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",12/22/2021,4.0,"Loved this place! Food was great and service and atmosphere was as well. The opa was a very interesting appetizer option, it is served with fried feta cheese a syrup like sauce and sliced baguette. It reminded me of something I would get and share for breakfast. The burger however was amazing!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Melissa S.,"Springfield, VA",3/14/2021,5.0,"Our last night in Knoxville and we finally got to try Stock and Barrel. We started with the fried pickles and duck fat fries. The breading on the pickles was so perfectly seasoned and not greasy at all. I enjoyed the duck fat fries and the garlic aioli. The Bernie was excellent! The blueberry jam that they put on it evens out all the flavors and makes the burger that much better. My husband ordered the farmhouse burger and enjoyed every single bite. There are so many places to choose from in Market Square, but make the time to try this one out!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Madison M.,"Chicago, IL",7/20/2021,5.0,"Our group of 12 stopped here on our way from Indiana to the Smoky Mountains and we're not disappointed! We all tried different burgers (because duh, it's a burger place) and had fantastic meals. I ordered the Elvis burger which has peanut butter and banana on it. Our waitress recommend trying it with the blueberry jam as well which was an excellent suggestion. Overall, we all felt as though our food came out quick, correct, and hot. Would recommend it to others."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,S M.,"Anderson, SC",6/24/2022,4.0,"The gluten free bun was like a cornbread texture but oh, so amazing. It was honestly my favorite part of the meal. Burger was pretty overdone. Everyone at our table seemed happy with their meal."

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lizzy A.,"MD, MD",7/2/2022,4.0,"In an amazing location, super easy to get to. Staff was wonderful, friendly and helpful. Asked about our preferences and what we were looking for. Helped us pick out drinks/whiskeys and cocktails. Onion rings were amazing, crispy with a thick onion inside without overly battering the outside. Our burgers were decent. Cooked well, balanced with toppings, good flavor overall. Not the best burger I've ever had but good overall, hence the 4 stars and not 5. I had the tomato salad as my side and it was delicious, would recommend that and return for it. Would return and try again but would also look at the other restaurants in the area."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Taylor B.,"Abilene, TX",6/26/2021,4.0,"Very cool spot. The staff and drink selection is top notch. The burgers and fries (and onion rings) are worth a look. Highly recommend if you're in this area. Not a revolutionary place, but a pretty good burger spot!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Luayy A.,"Ann Arbor, MI",6/28/2021,5.0,I have just say stock and barrel is out of this world pretty good from every right to every morsel I have to say the burger was crazy... I was impressed it was so well worth going there a second time even though I couldn't eat anything the first time because of Covid and it was well worth be going down to Knoxville just to have a burger of its kind yes agree such a bourbon course whiskey I mean people are friendly you're in Tennessee I Tessie has great food but this something is great about having a burger there is unique to Knoxville
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ceri F.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2020,4.0,"Bison is one of my favorite proteins and it's hard to find on any menu. So when I see it on a menu I'm always game to try. This was our second time here for the bison burger. The first time we had to send it back because it was over seasoned. And for me to say that, is saying a lot. I do love my seasoning. It was frankly an edible with the amount of seasoning that was on it. I never get buns and maybe it is why it was so strong to meThis time we ordered it with no seasoning on both the burger and the french fries and we were not disappointed. It was absolutely delicious. It was cooked to perfection and you can never go on wrong with a egg on top. My daughter got a regular hamburger with cheddar cheese, bacon and topped with an egg. She said it was outstanding.Overall I gave it four stars strictly because I'm not a fan of the seasoning. But we will definitely go back"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matthew R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2021,5.0,Excellent burger spot.  Never had a bad experience and it's always solid!The burger to get for me is The Billy with a fried egg on top:).
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel S.,"Indianapolis, IN",6/12/2021,4.0,We were in Knoxville for a girls trip and went for dinner. I got the wedge salad and fries. The salad was delicious.

We would definitely return if we are in the area.

For the burger, I ordered the Bernie and that was incredibly flavorful and the beer battered jalapenos added a really satisfying crunch and a nice acidity that added to the overall burger experience. For my side, I ended up replacing the regular fries for duck fat fries, which was definitely the move. Our table also ended up getting the fried green tomatoes. If you're going to get any of the appetizers, I would 100% recommend the tomatoes. They are beyond phenomenal. They may have even been my favorite part of the meal."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Elias F.,"Oakhurst, CA",6/1/2021,5.0,Such good food. Not your standard burgers. Try the Elvis! Great people work here. They took great care of us. We eat gluten free and when we asked for the GF buns etc they clarified it's not a separate GF kitchen and wanted to make sure that was OK. Very much appreciated.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jon P.,"Shore Acres, Staten Island, NY",12/13/2021,4.0,Good food and service with reasonable prices. Market square has several bar restaurants and this one is a good choice.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jennifer D.,"Mobile, AL",5/23/2021,4.0,This place is so fun and absolutely delicious. I will be back to try the whiskey flights. I wasn't drinking today.My friends and I got different burger and shared. The Hurt Locker was the best of the three we got. So creamy and delicious! Followed by the sweet and spicy Bernie life. My least favorite was actually mine which was the Black and Blue. I only knock off a star as the fries were cold and didn't seem fresh but I did 50/50 with onion rings and the onion rings were great! Also partially annoyed at the hostess staff as they did not seem thrilled to be there and several open tables but weren't seating quickly at all.Other than that great place and great area. Super cool! Check it out!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tracie B.,"Wisconsin Dells, WI",12/17/2021,4.0,"Great burger, so so fries, and poor service. I'll go back for the burger, it was that good. Service I guess is to be expected at this time, but I really am going to start tipping based on service and not just my usual 20 %. Seems that waitstaff now expect 20 % tip no matter what, but I'm done tipping that much for poor service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dionne F.,"Knoxville, TN",2/11/2020,5.0,The best made from scratch honey mustard  dipping sauce. My son really enjoyed his amazing chicken tenders and fries.Stock & Barrel has the best s'mores shakes on the planet.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Olivia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/29/2020,3.0,"The fried pickles have decent flavor, but they're a little soggy. The Mac and cheese was very smoky, which was a little off putting."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John M.,"Roxbury Township, NJ",6/3/2022,5.0,Great burger awesome vibe and service was solid. Not a huge menu- but great bar food.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Emily C.,"Knoxville, TN",3/18/2022,4.0,"Hands down best burgers in Knoxville.  And you HAVE to get the duck fat fries.  Just be prepared to wait a while because depending on the day sometimes it can be up to a 2 hour wait.  But if you get there ahead of time, go ahead and reserve a table then give yourself time to shop around market square or grab a drink until your table is ready."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Donald W.,"Knoxville, TN",11/29/2021,4.0,Never been here to eat but finally tried it with my two friends The hamburger and french fries were tasty.the server always checking on me Love this place Eat here and enjoy Holidays On Ice at Market square
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stiven S.,"Knoxville, TN",6/9/2022,5.0,Everything is great go enjoy good food and the trout is amazing the smash potatoes awesome
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian H.,"Richmond, KY",10/17/2020,5.0,"First time here are we were very impressed. Service was spot on for our large group. Had the Bernie Burger which was amazing. It sounds like an odd combination, but it's great. Duck Confit fries were also worth the extra two bucks. Probably the only thing to be aware of is there is only one bathroom for everyone."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Casey C.,"Knoxville, TN",3/3/2022,5.0,"Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Stock & Barrel- Dana, our server, was absolutely wonderful and so great. The duck fat fries are not to be missed- can't wait to visit again soon and try another burger!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Malinda F.,"Knoxville, TN",2/25/2022,5.0,Wonderful burger and fries!Black and Blue Burger.         The best of everything and right on Market Square.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kyle Adams A.,"Knoxville, TN",2/24/2022,5.0,This place is the bomb!!! Burgers are amazing. Best onion rings I've ever had. Duck fries are a MUST. Wedge salad is again the best I've ever had. My boyfriend and I can't get enough out of this place. The only thing I would change is that I just wish it was a bigger space!! On a busy night you'll be elbow to elbow with other tables and hearing everyone's conversations but hey that's market square for ya.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chase C.,"Washington, DC",3/26/2021,1.0,"This use to be one of my favorite places in Knoxville. After tonight however I will never be returning. My wife ordered a to go burger and we showed up about 5 minutes after the time it was supposed to be ready. I went in and informed them I was there to pick up the order. I was told it would be ready soon so I let them know I'd be standing outside waiting. I know things are busy and post Covid regulations make things difficult so I figured a few minutes delay was no big deal. 20 minutes later a host came out to ask me what name the order was under. I gave him my wife's name. He was snippy and extremely unpleasant, but we had already paid online so there was really nothing to be done. So I continued to wait.30 minutes after that a waitress finally walks out and begins to tell me a story of how they gave our food to another person and then had to remake it. Keep in mind I've been standing there for an hour and this is the first I'm hearing of it. While she continues to tell me the story of all the mistakes she's continually putting her hand in the bag and even in the container with the burger so now I'm kinda grossed out and not sure if I even want my wife to eat it. As she continued to just tell me a story and not even offer an apology, either for the mistake or letting me stand there for an hour not knowing, I eventually had to just ask her to hand me the burger so I could leave. Now I'm going to pick up a pizza that's already cold because I was supposed to be there to pick it up an hot ago. I don't ever mind working with a mistake, but it's really disappointing that a restaurant that was so good has decided to treat people so poorly. I've made a point to only eat local since the pandemic started and I've ordered to go from here with no problem on several previous occasions. It seems that now dine in takes priority and to go food is an annoyance for them.So to sum up. No apology. No communication. No offer for a discount or any sort of reparation."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Clam C.,"Morristown, TN",5/31/2022,5.0,"This is absolutely without a doubt the best burger in Knoxville. Chandler is one of the best bar tenders, ... always top notch & atmosphere is hard to beat."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michelle S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",5/31/2022,5.0,Best burger I ever had...IN MY LIFE!  I can wait to go back to knocksville so i can come here again.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Candace H.,"Gwinnett Village, Norcross, GA",11/7/2021,1.0,"I walked into your restaurant on 11/6 and your hostess didn't even look up from her computer/tablet system to engage in discussion with me. I found this to be rude. You should greet all customers and look at them when talking to them. It was around 6:50 and she told me I could not be seated. You should especially look at people when you are denying them entry into your establishment. It's a shame, I see you have a lot of stats and what looks like great food."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jenna W.,"Boca Raton, FL",1/13/2022,3.0,Really nice service! Was very crowded inside. Not a huge fan of the meal I had or the way they stuff bodies in their establishment. Very very greasy food. Added duck  fat to fries was just way too much!! Took my burger for leftovers & couldn't even bare the sight of it. Could be personal preference but wouldn't recommend if you can't handle the grease.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Samantha R.,"Plainfield, IL",2/10/2022,5.0,"Great burgers, friendly staff, and solid drinks. I'd love to try something else on the menu the next time I'm in town!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tonya O.,"TN, TN",5/26/2022,4.0,Food is always delicious. Wait time was no problem on a Saturday afternoon. Maybe 15 minutes.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mary L.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",10/26/2021,3.0,We came into this place with some pretty big expectations. I have heard from some church friends that this place is the cats pajamas. You can imagine my disappointment when we had to wait an hour for a table. Host team was kind but slightly impatient. Food was alright. Worth the wait? Not exactly. Service was okay but you could tell these folks weren't exactly dying to serve you.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Julia D.,"TN, TN",1/31/2022,5.0,Great food and great drinks! It's a little pricey but the quality of food made it worth it!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian V.,"Weddington, NC",10/23/2020,4.0,"Stock & Barrel was number one for both lunch and dinner on Yelp so I figured it would be a safe bet.  First off, after spending several days enjoying Music City, and eating in my second restaurant in Knoxville, it is abundantly clear that the Covid Prevention standards are much looser n Knoxville.  Everywhere I have been all restaurants have went to QR Code menus or disposals.  I am surprised that the germ carrying original menus are still in use here.  All seating indoors for social distancing is nonexistent.  Case and point, a gentlemen is coughing at the table beside me and is no more than 5 ft. Where he sitting and 4 ft when he leaned over to cough beside me as I'm writing this review.  Mask on!!Another case is bar seating.  Based on social distancing you would think they would post signs on seats or remove some so people get the picture.  I have always thought highly of this city so it is a bit disappointinAnyway, last trip to Knoxville until further notice.On with my S&B review: I ordered the farmhouse burger which comes with garlic aioli, a fried egg and other fixin's with half fries and half O rings.  I have high hopes for this burger based on the Yelp reviews.   The burger, fries and O-rings  were phenomenal. The burger was seasoned perfectly and the bun was also very fresh.  I have to tell you I stared at the egg for a ""minute"" while I planned my attack!!Eventually I just decided to dig in and was very thankful that my server had brought me a big stack of napkins.  I did manage to keep the mess off of my clothes and but the yolk and the juice from the med. rare made a tasty dipping sauce for the fries.The fries and O-rings were crispy and good.S&B is a great place for casual dining in Market Square if your in the area. Thanks."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heidi B.,"Saint Joseph, IL",7/22/2021,5.0,"You may have a little bit of wait to get a table, but it's totally worth it! We had a great waiter, who was very knowledgeable with the local breweries and the menu. Everything we had was so good!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel E.,"Knoxville, TN",9/16/2021,5.0,"Always great service and food. Worth the wait, but don't come with large groups unless it's in the slow hours. This venue is best fit for a small intimate meal with 1-4folks. As for the food, the Duck confit fries with the bison burger are easily one of the best burger meals I've experienced. As a picky eater and quasi foodie this joint nails it and doesn't leave you unsatisfied in the way of flavor, portion, or ambiance."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Greg R.,"Florence, KY",7/17/2021,4.0,Stopped off in Knoxville to see a few sites and had a great lunch in a small gem located near UT's campus. The service was great and the staff was very friendly. Had a few fried shroom's and there homemade horseradish sauce was great!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jonathan G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/27/2020,5.0,"People have told me about this place since I moved to TN, and thank you to all of them, because this place is so good! The vibe is just perfect for a burger shop from the south (and not in a dinnery way). The place has woodish tones in the walls and the tables, and the waiters are very accomodating. But the food is the main event. I will say, not every burger is delish. I think the shroomin' the big nasty and the steakhouse are alright, but the one you should try is the Hurt Locker! It might sound simple, but when the waiter recommended it I knew I had to try it, and so do you! I can't wait to go back and try the Bernie which I have heard a lot about with it's blueberry preserve."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kenny W.,"Trinity, NC",2/27/2022,5.0,"I was passing through Knoxville at lunch time and wanted a good burger. I searched on Yelp and this place popped up with great reviews and the pictures, well, they spoke... I hit the nav, found a parking spot (more on that later) and was there, so I thought. The nav made it hard to locate - it's in like a really cool and trendy little court yard area, but to me was hard to find. I asked what seemed to be a local if he knew where Stock & Barrel was, and with excitement he pointed it out while also validating what a great choice I had made with ""best burgers in the state, my favorite place in town to eat and get a beer!""  He wait wasn't bad for lunch time on a Friday, and because I was alone I skipped the wait by grabbing a single seat at the bar. The bartender was a sweetheart from start to finish, I alter a couple things on my burger order, asked for blue cheese and wing sauce on my fries and she along with the kitchen got it perfectly correct. The burger and fries were both among the best I've ever had and the service was a 10 as well!  Parking on the other hand, I guess unless you're a local and know the hacks, turned out to be a challenge.  I found a spot marked ""1 hour loading and unloading"". I figured I could load my burger and fries within an hour, which I did in 51 mins according to the timer on my iPhone... When I got back to the car, I had a gift from the city of Knoxville - an extra $16 added to the tab. Turns out, they judge whether you should be loading and unloading by whether or not you have a commercial tag on your vehicle. So, Stock & Barrel is stars all the way around and the city of Knoxville has fairly good parking citation rates. All in all, it was well worth the detour!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian G.,"Auburn, WA",1/3/2022,5.0,Great food combos and atmosphere! Go to when at market square. Make sure to use yelp to join the waitlist well ahead of time! Sometimes the wait is 2+ hours!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lacey L.,"Green Bay, WI",4/2/2021,5.0,This place is amazing and definitely worth the wait if you are put on the waiting list! Would definitely go back!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jenniffer C.,"Miami, FL",12/26/2021,4.0,I went there with my family and waited almost two hours to get seated. The food there  was worth it. We got two appetizers and they were great! Chili cheese and the feta cheese with baguette. We ate the turkey burgers with fries and onion rings. Everything was delicious. The service was ok considering the amount of people. The chairs no very comfortable and the place was loud and crowded. No safe for Covid in my opinion. It was a good experience to know this place even though the amount of people there for the Christmas season.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Colton G.,"Phoenix, AZ",1/14/2022,5.0,Great atmosphere and really good bud on with a fantastic burger. A little loud but it's brick inside and people were having a blast.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Karyn F.,"Bronx, NY",6/17/2021,5.0,"I was wondering why there were noticeably more people at this restaurant than all the bars around. It's because their food, drinks, and staff are amazing."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Russell T.,"Knoxville, TN",8/1/2021,1.0,"I would give ZERO stars if I could! Don't waist your time on a weekend night! I called and spoke directly with the manager. Explained that we had 6 adults and 2 toddlers, he instructed me to use the Yelp check in app approx. 45 minutes before our arrival and it would put us at or near the top of the list! That was total CRAP! We arrived only to be told by the night shift manager that "" we are sorry but we only have one table for groups of six or larger and we just sat a party of 6 ten minutes ago so your wait will be at least an HOUR"" I Walked 3 businesses down and "" Not Watson's Kitchen & Bar"" sat us immediately!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jonny M.,"Franklin, TN",10/6/2020,5.0,"One of the best Old Fashioneds I've had in a while.  And I had the Elvis burger with peanut butter and bacon and fried bananas.  Yes please!Great vibe, great service, great food, great cocktails.  5 stars all around!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bryan R.,"Knoxville, TN",4/22/2022,5.0,"Burgers were unreal, will definitely be coming again shortly to get one! Also, the house old fashioned was one of the best that I've ever had so try that too!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Larry L.,"Clementon, NJ",11/28/2021,4.0,Great food! Great appetizers! Great drinks! 4 stars because the vegetarian main options are a bit limited. They'll happily put their black bean burger on any of the burgers but it's a bit dry. Another option would be awesome! (Especially if it were a Beyond or Impossible patty!)
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Andrea Marie M.,"Pikeville, TN",11/27/2021,5.0,"OMG!!! We ordered the ""Bernie"", the ""Black N Bleu"" and the pimento cheese dip with pita chips. The waitstaff was beyond helpful & friendly....very personable. She recommended what we ordered & it was the best. If you leave here hungry it's your own fault. Located downtown Knoxville. Parking is somewhat difficult but once you get to the restaurant it's worth it. I can see why this is one of the top restaurants in Knoxville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ron A.,"Louisville, KY",7/31/2019,4.0,What is there not to like.. Great Bourbon selection and fantastic burgers...I enjoyed the steak burger with onion rings and my dining companion had The Hurt Locker... both most excellent....I took one star because they were out of several bourbons I wanted to try..
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Clint B.,"San Francisco, CA",12/10/2021,5.0,Baleigh was the best server I have ever experienced in my life!!! We were a group of 5 and none of us had ever been to Tennessee before. She was incredibly patient with our very complicated orders and was always refilling our waters and just generally being so charming. Every restaurant should be honored to have her on their staff. We love you Baleigh!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Elaine D.,"Knoxville, TN",8/7/2021,3.0,"Crowded place with just ok hamburgers. Large portions which are good for sharing, but the fact you have to climb over people to get in the door doesn't leave me wanting to come back. I can get a burger at other places that is as good, so unless I can sit at the bar, I don't really go."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christina C.,"Fountain City, Knoxville, TN",2/7/2022,5.0,You ever walked into a restaurant and the smell alone makes you start drooling? Well this place does it. BEST bison burger ever and the duck fries... oh my i could eat my weight in those. 10/10 must try
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Karin B.,"TN, TN",3/29/2022,2.0,"I really wanted to love  this restaurant after reading the mostly rave reviews. First the pros-  Really busy Monday night, but we were seated immediately.  Our server greeted us quickly and was really nice. We were very hungry so we placed our food order right away- also ordered an old fashioned.   My old fashioned arrived after about 10 minutes.  It was very good.We didn't order any apps. So now onto the burgers which finally arrived after about 40 minutes. The classic bacon and the farmhouse.  We ordered both medium rare- they came close...more of a medium.  The egg on my burger was perfectly runny.  The bacon was super tasty as were the onion rings that came on the side. Other than that it didn't have much flavor at all.  The burger itself needed more seasoning.  The bun was terrible. It seemed stale and tasted like cardboard.My partner said her burger was very bland as well. No flavor at all and same issues with the bun. Stale and tasteless.  Plus, her fries were cold.  She asked for hot fries and a fresh batch were brought out within 2 minutes. They were just as cold. Seems like they pre-make their fries and keep them under a warmer. Maybe it was an off night because of how busy it was for a Monday, but we won't be returning to find out."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jan A.,"Rockford, TN",2/17/2021,5.0,"Some of the best burgers in Knoxville!!  Those duck fat fries are like crack!!  Great local spot, wish they'd open a second location since this one is so small."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jamie M.,"Arlington, TX",12/28/2020,5.0,Hands down the best Fried Green Tomatoes I've ever had. I'm not a huge goat cheese fan goat cheese but it works perfectly with the tomatoes and balsamic reduction.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Onomatopoeia O.,"Knoxville, TN",6/27/2021,3.0,"If you like to sweat while you eat, you will love this place!  I would NEVER eat here again in the summer (I like A/C). The BARELY functional Air Conditioner (which I was told was broken, but then, after asking more, I was informed that it has been ""broken"" for years) prevents me from giving this place an additional 1/2 stars.  My burger was over cooked (but good).  I had to get up to go get the waiter to get silverware AFTER all food was delivered to table.  If my burger was cooked properly, I would have given them an additional 1/2 stars."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cinda S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/6/2021,3.0,"This is a small Burger joint on a corner of Market Square. I have been here before with friends and enjoyed it.  Today - not so much. My husband loves this place, as do all of our meat eating friends.  But for those who are vegetarians, such as myself, it is not so great! Their house made veggie burger is anything BUT delicious, and literally falls apart in chunks while you are trying to eat it. Something that I have experienced on previous visits. This time however, the chef's must have made a change to their usual ""just ok"" veggie burger.  I took one bite of this eye pleasing sandwich and could not even eat it!! It had an overwhelming garlic taste and I had even ordered it without their garlic aioli !  The other vegetarian in our party also could not eat her sandwich for the same reason.  It was like a giant piece of garlic between the toasted bun! So, we ate the fries and when our very nice & friendly waitress came to pick up our plates she ask if we wanted a take home box.  My friend and I both said - almost in chorus - NO! Our waitress never ask if anything was wrong and made no comment to our uneaten sandwiches - just smiled and whisked them away. Yes, we gave her a generous tip (we are decent people folks!) but feel that she should have ask why we ate the appetizers and fries and not the sandwiches!  Seriously Stock & Barrel.......there are plenty of vegetarian burgers out there that you could offer the vegetarians in our town! We love food the same as the next guy.....just prefer not to eat something that has a face...or a mother - or was our pet when we were growing up!! Ok - I'm off the pedestal now - if you enjoy a great real burger and awesome fries & appetizers ..... this is your place. If you are a vegetarian or vegan.....just go to enjoy the time with your friends!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Doug J.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",4/9/2022,2.0,"Horrible wait time.   Went in got on the list, forgot to ask how long.  Went up after 20 minutes and asked the two young men at the desk how long.  Was told, 30 minutes.    An hour later, asked again, after seeing multiple groups coming in off the street be seated.   Was told were just doing our job.  No apology, no nothing, they couldn't care less.  15minutes later, we were seated.  Food was good but not worth and hour and 45 minute wait.  At least tell people that it's a 90 minute wait.       Won't go back and won't recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alexandra P.,"Knoxville, TN",2/18/2020,5.0,"I took my brother here for lunch when he was visiting. He wanted to go somewhere that I hadn't taken him on previous visits and I had this place bookmarked for a long time. The space is smaller than I thought it would be but it's a very cool place! We especially loved all the movie based artwork on the walls. The tables are pretty close to each other but I found it to be cozy. They were very busy but we were able to get a table quickly. We ordered fried pickles and I got the veggie burger while my brother ordered a regular burger. My veggie burger was great! And the fries were amazing! Obviously, fresh cut. The fried pickles are the best in town. I put some on my burger too. My brother loved his sandwich too. The service was great as well so we will definitely be back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Johnny A.,"TN, TN",12/26/2021,1.0,Waiting 45 mins for sitting and then waited 30 mins for no one to serve us or tell us they will be with us! So we got up and left and are leaving this shitty review
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah E.,"Cincinnati, OH",3/17/2019,3.0,"The good: so many bourbon choices. Excellent onion rings. Locally made buns. Black bean burger substitute. Good location. Unique flavor combos The bad: close quarters, tables and chairs are very close together. Average burgers. Very dark inside. Would return."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sydney L.,"Rockford, TN",5/1/2021,5.0,"We had Sophie G as our waitress and she was absolutely amazing! Very bubbly, funny, and lighthearted. I took her advice with the Hurt Locker burger and it was amazing. She knew both the drink and food menu very well! She deserved every bit of the over 20% tip we gave, and we wish her the best and a thank you for making our first meal in Knox awesome. We're a couple from SC visiting for the weekend and we were more than happy with how this meal turned out. I think it's well worth going if ur visiting Knoxville. Definitely a meal I'll remember! Sitting outside was gorgeous too."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jimmy V.,"Santa Ana, CA",1/4/2021,4.0,"A theme restaurant - it looked like a nicely decorated restaurant serving mostly different types of burger.  We had the classic bacon and the steakhouse.  While I found my burger delicious, I also found the burger as a whole could be smoother.  The fries were fresh and nice.  It was a nice experience overall and the service was definitely friendly and fast."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shannon T.,"Knoxville, TN",6/3/2021,5.0,"Without a doubt, best burgers in town. Long waits are common, but the bison burger is worth the wait. For dessert, the peanut butter pie is fantastic."

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vanessa N.,"Sarasota, FL",10/19/2021,5.0,The burgers were great. May have been the best brown ale I've ever had on tap. Outdoor seating allowed us to enjoy our meal along the clean pedestrian shopping  area.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie P.,"Shakopee, MN",3/8/2020,5.0,"Worth the wait! I was visit my little sister, who lives in Knoxville, and she said she's never been here before. I'll tell ya, what a miss on her part! The wait was not terribly long and they text you when your table is ready. I had the Bernie burger and I highly recommend (Bernie fan or not ;) ). The tables are close together but it's a small place with high demand!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1/5/2020,3.0,"It's located in the heart of Market Square, so you know it's going to be good. The best in Nashville AND Knoxville? That's what the sign outfront said. There was a short wait for our group of five, but it was peak lunch hour. I noticed that many of the solo lunch goers were making their way to the bar to immediately sit. I started with an order of the fried pickles to share with my tablemates. They were perfectly battered and fried, but had a unique sweet taste. For my entree, I ordered the bison burger. I've only had a bison burger at Ted's, so I don't have many experiences to compare it to, but I would describe it cooked beyond medium well. I usually order my beef burgers well done, so I'm use to a dry texture, but the bison here had a much drier texture than I enjoy. I was super disappointed with the duck fat fries. After a bit of confusion and my side arriving as more fried pickles, one of the wait staff asked if I wanted to replace the extra fried pickles with duck fat fries. Me, not knowing that the duck fat fries were different than what my table mates were enjoying as their side, I unknowingly requested the soggier version of fries. If you like soft fries, the duck fat fries might be up your alley, but I wasn't a fan. They all raved about the regular fries though."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany R.,"Forsyth, GA",10/10/2021,5.0,"One of the BEST burgers I've ever eaten! The service was amazing! It was busy but our waitress kept our drinks full and the food came out hot, fresh, and quick. We got there around 6:20 and there was a 2 1/2 wait. We weren't expecting that but we walked around, shopped, and enjoyed the city. I definitely recommend if you come to Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Karli T.,"Suwanee, GA",9/6/2021,4.0,"Was craving a cheeseburger while in Knoxville. Waited an hour for a table so was hoping for something good. I got the 'Merican burger with onion rings. Onion rings were great not overly heavy like some places. The burger was cooked to perfection (medium) and all in all the taste was great. Only thing I can say is for a burger joint I feel like they should have more of a selection of cheese to choose from for your burger. They only had cheddar, Swiss and pepper jack. Hubby got the bacon burger, his was a little over cooked but tasted good. The duck fat fries are wonderful."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ka L.,"Midland, NC",4/6/2021,5.0,"Drove through Knoxville and this restaurant didn't disappoint. Friendly staff - Hailey was our waitress and she was awesome and attentive. There was no wait time and we sat outside and enjoyed the perfect weather.Ordered the dip for appetizer, classic bacon burger and the bison burger. The meat was perfectly cooked and had great flavors. The dip was delicious. I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the area. We parked in the parking garage which was but a small walk away from the restaurant."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nancy Z.,"Olympia, WA",5/30/2021,5.0,This great restaurant is in a cute part of town. Come early and walk around Market Square.  We had a Billy Burger and it was amazing! Popular place so get there early.

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kris V.,"Sevierville, TN",4/2/2022,5.0,"Great food and unique menu! Definitely recommend going on a weekday it's easier to get seated than on a weekend, which is pretty standard for downtown Knox."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ben W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/12/2019,5.0,"Best burger in Knoxville! It shouldn't even be a question, if this is the best burger in town. The menu is burger focused, but creative. The French fries are fresh cut and are a must. The Market Square location is perfect. Be prepared to wait, because the seating is scarce and the restaurant is very popular. Check-in Online aheadnofbt"

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christopher T.,"Birmingham, AL",2/3/2019,5.0,"This is a great local place in downtown Knoxville. They are a farm to table type restaurant with great burgers.   They have a lot of interesting combinations on the great ole burger.   The place is always busy and they have limited seating so come early or prepare to wait a bit.   The farmhouse is a nice go to,  it's a tour of the farm on a bun! They also have a few non beef options.  They have a nice play on chicken and waffles. I would recommend this joint to anyone passing thru or here for a bit."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amanda J.,"Louisville, KY",10/18/2020,5.0,"We decided to pop into this cute little gem while staying one night in downtown Knoxville. We tried to call to make a reservation however the recording states they do not accept any and that they are only seating at 50% capacity due to COVID. The hostess greeted us and we were told there was an hour to an hour and a half wait which we were pretty bummed about however we took our chances and walked over to the bar to find someone was cashing out so we sat down almost instantly. The bartender was friendly and energetic and recommend several cocktails while pointing out their large bourbon selection. We decided on an Old Fashion and the Black Betty which were both divine. The Black Betty was very light and refreshing. For appetizers we started with the OPA! (Pan Seared Feta + Tennessee Honey Drizzle + Baguette) and the Fried Green Tomatoes (Green Tomatoes + Goat Cheese + Balsamic Reduction). The OPA! was definitely my favorite, it was sweet, savory and absolutely delicious. The the flavor profile of Fried Green Tomatoes was good however they were too thick for my preference. I like them sliced much thinner. We then shared the Classic Bacon Burger (Mitchell Family Beef + Cheddar + Benton's Bacon + Bourbon Onions + Pickles + Tomato + Greens + Mayo) I was hoping for more of a flavor profile but the burger was just ok, the patty was very think and the burger was extremely messy. It was also over cooked which wasn't a huge deal, it happens. Regardless of the burger not meeting ""my"" expectations I would still 100% recommend checking this place out."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Hungry I.,"Leesburg, VA",1/28/2022,5.0,"Delicious burgers, great friendly service and a fantastic selection of whiskeys.  Onion rings were on point"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jaylah E.,"Atlanta, GA",2/13/2021,5.0,this was my first time dropping by after wanting to go for months. the turkey burger was SO good. it was very flavorful and i could tell they actually made the patty and didn't just buy a turkey burger from a store. i don't eat beef so i always try turkey from various shops and this might be the best one i've ever had. the fries were also very good.in addition our server was very friendly and very attentive.definitely would go back
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tatiana V.,"Medical District, Greenville, NC",12/6/2021,5.0,"Burgers were phenomenal, service by Gracalynn was superb, and the milkshakes were so delicious! I haven't had service or food this great in a long time! They were busy but still were great! The only thing is if you want to order the refined gentleman it's delicious but it comes in a Martini shaped glass not a high glass! Just a warning!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike B.,"Knox, TN",7/2/2021,5.0,"I love the bison burger & it also comes with the ""duck fries"". If you get another burger I strongly suggest paying the upcharge for the duck confit fries! No exaggeration, this is one of the best burgers on the east coast! Use this app to check in, waits are long."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dave B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",3/16/2019,5.0,"In need of a juicy burger and found it!After doing a couple of Yelp searches we decided on trying Stock & Barrel.  Started off with the spicy crab dip which had just the right amount of kick.  From there I went with the Shroomin' burger with fries. Asked for it medium and it was cooked perfectly.  Nice and juicy.  Lots of mushrooms, cheese and a light zip of the horseradish.  Also washed it down with the Kentucky Bourbon Ale they had on tap.  That stuff was awesome.  And Laken begins the bar was very friendly and helpful on suggestions.  Overall we had a great experience at S&B.  We'll be back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Clare C.,"Columbus, OH",3/11/2020,5.0,I came here two years ago and I've been dreaming of this sandwich ever since! It lived up to its expectations! The sandwich was delicious with the garlic aoli and the bread! We decided to try the crab din and the ingredients worked so well together. It was creamy with just the right amount of spice. I don't think there were enough pita chips for the dip but the dip was great by itself! Our waiter was super friendly and the weather was perfect to sit outside on the patio! Wonderful experience!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sean F.,"Knoxville, TN",12/22/2019,5.0,"Came to downtown for some errands, and wanted to drop in again and get a bison burger (my wife is anemic and the iron in bison is very high, which helps her, and tastes good). I opted for the farmhouse burger, but substituted a bison patty instead of the beef. I got mine unseasoned (they tend to have a heavy hand with the seasoning, which seems to be a trend here in Knoxville of late, or maybe has been always and I just never noticed). The burgers were perfectly cooked, and the onion rings were the star of the show in my mind, so so so good! We ate everything and took nothing home, a sign of a very good meal. Highly recommend this place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Natalie M.,"Henrietta, NY",12/9/2020,4.0,Get the bison burger! So juicy and flavorful. If your In the mood for a savory burger this is the best to get.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Darya S.,"Tempe, AZ",10/22/2019,3.0,"Stock & Barrel has a wide range of options on their menu, from salads to burgers to meat entrees to sandwiches. It's a bar atmosphere mixed with an actual restaurant. You can sit at the high-top tables or the booths; we did the booth, and we were seated immediately on a Saturday night. Our waitress was very peppy and attentive. We chose to have the green fried tomatoes, the steak, and the salmon. The highlight for me was the tomatoes, because, well, duh, you're in the South so you've gotta get some, and plus, they have this goat cheese/balsamic vinegar mixture on top, and I loved that. Boyfriend got a drink that I can't remember - probably whiskey? They sure have a lot of alcohol options. The salmon was cooked so well, but I wish it was bigger, because I was still hungry afterwards. It came with some veggies that I appreciated. The steak was also cooked perfectly to medium level, and that was a good portion. Both came with mashed potatoes with bacon bits in it, which I enjoyed. Overall, good, reliable American food in a lively atmosphere. Doesn't seem like you could go wrong with much on the menu."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stacy F.,"Tonawanda, NY",10/10/2018,5.0,"A great find in the Market Square area. If you like burger bars, this is your spot. It has a craft burger bar vibe once your inside. It's dimly lit for ambiance and the bar had open service seating, so we sat up there for quicker service.Our bartender was excellent. He was quick to recommend items and was very friendly throughout. The burgers are solid. Mine was cooked as ordered, which seems like an easy thing, but happens less often than you'd think. The mac and cheese was yummy - recommend it as a side.Give some of their handcrafted cocktails / drinks a go, it's nice to try out the specials places have on offer. Plus you never know what new drink you'll fall in love with. If you aren't feeling adventurous, they have your classic beer and wine menu as well.Overall: A+Great burger bar! Get a burger, try the mac and cheese, and go for a handcrafted specialty drink."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Pamela Z.,"Miami, FL",12/29/2019,4.0,"Great burgers and good portions !!! I loved the vegetarian option. They should add more to their menu ! Cute location and decor and waiters are very young, vibrant, and energetic. There is also an INSANE variety of whiskeys and beers."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Danielle N.,"Park Meadow, Beech Grove, IN",12/18/2019,5.0,"This place was so good, my husband is a bourbon snob so of course this was where he picked out to go for dinner this evening in knoxville. We were just passing through on our way to North Carolina. They specialize in burgers, bourbon and beer. My hubby got The Ring of Fire burger and I just got the classic. His had lots of different peppers on it which was very very warm and mine was just classic. Each came with either fries or onion rings so we did what we always do and he got fries and I got onion rings so we could share. Overall really good food, if your ever in Knoxville definitely check it out, I believe they also have one located in Nashville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Eric R.,"Knoxville, TN",10/26/2020,5.0,"I'll keep this one short and sweet as I'm sure I'm not saying anything different than the other 1,000 people who have rated S&B. BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. S&B really does have it all. With a cozy yet lively dining room and bar, you can feel comfortable at S&B whether it's date night or game day. The duck fat fries are a MUST and go ahead and order any burger you'd like because they are all fantastic. The wait staff are all kind and friendly as well. This is my GO TO burger spot!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joy C.,"Northwest, Denver, CO",2/26/2022,5.0,"Absolutely recommend you try this place! Despite it being packed since it was a weekend, they were quick to get us on a 30min waitlist. We were seated and the waitress was speedy and knew the menu inside and out (great since I have food sensitivities)! The burgers were some of the best my husband and I have had and the drinks were just as delicious! We will definitely return next time we are in town. Food was hot and fast and the service was excellent overall!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kerry T.,"Grafton, MA",2/25/2022,5.0,We stopped in to eat after a tour of University of Tennessee and this place was amazing. One of the best meals I have had.

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Candace M.,"Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, CA",10/15/2019,4.0,"Fine place. It came up when I searched vegan and honestly we were desperate- and also there seems to be pretty much no vegan food in Knoxville! This is mostly about being vegan in Knoxville and trying to eat!! Went on a Friday night- DEFINITELY put yourself on the waitlist here on yelp as it will save you a lot of time! While we were there tons of ppl left because of long wait! Dog friendly outside. Great beer list, nice cocktails. Amazing whisky selection.  I asked and their veg burger (I think quinoa burger) was not vegan so all I could get was aside of fries and side of corn black bean salad with no cheese. It was all fine and we really needed to eat so it's what I had to go with but not my fave. Just make a vegan veggie burger or better yet, serve the Beyond burger!! Seriously even the most meaty burger joints like this one serve up a vegan burger - there's literally no point in 2019 to have a non vegan veg burger; just make it vegan so everyone can enjoy it. Partner had a proper burger and fries and it was huge and he didn't even finish it it was so rich. Thems the breaks I guess!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rebecca S.,"TN, TN",2/14/2022,5.0,"First time trying stock barrel, I really liked the wide arrangement and types of burgers. Also so many choices for drinks! Highly recommend trying if in town. Can become a pretty long wait though"

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason B.,"Cincinnati, OH",10/12/2019,5.0,"My wife and I came here during our honeymoon in Gatlinburg. This restaurant piqued our interest, so we made the drive to Knoxville for it, and we were not disappointed.Let me first say that my wife and I have very different tastes. I like classic burgers, pizza, food in general, and while I'm adventurous, my preference is what I know is good. My wife always wants the more out-of-the-box choices, deviates more from the norm, and enjoys abnormal food combinations.With that preface, we both ordered the Bison with duck confit fries because it looked wonderful, and oh my gosh did it deliver. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had because of the amazing toppings and the high-quality bison.The duck confit fries were bursting with flavor and were basically as good as the burger. I can't choose which I liked better.I don't think my wife and I have ever ordered the same meal before, and even when we try each other's meals, we almost always like what we ordered better. Any meal that is amazing to both my wife and I must be universally delicious. I'm dying to come back eventually."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Greg W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/23/2020,5.0,"Great burgers with quite a selection of adult drinks. We had a party of four and we all tried different things. Mike was the Bernie with duck fries. While the fries were good, I missed the duck fat flavor. It was all very good though. And from the sweats and heat burps of one of our party I can attest that the ""ring of fire"" was in fact hot. Great service and great food, what else can you ask for!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Britt I.,"Victorville, CA",6/17/2021,4.0,Hungry travelers.  Good selection of burgers.  Great selection of beer.  Excellent selection of scotch and whiskey.  The onion rings were awesome.  Burgers were well cooked and sizeable.  Small locations and loud....but great experience.

From the Duck Fat Fries to the Chicken and Waffle sandwich to everything in between. The Old Fashioned my husband ordered was perfect and my draft IPA hit the spot. But the highlight was our server, Mason. He has the perfect personality and made our visit even better. Most delightful server I've had in a long time. Thank you, Mason!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vidhi P.,"Sevierville, TN",8/8/2019,5.0,"This place has the BEST burgers in town! Loads of drink options, great customer service & the garlic aioli sauce is delicious! I always request extra bc it's that good. I was introduced to S&B thru a friend, and every time we visit Knoxville, we always eat here! Great place for casual lunch, dinner & gatherings. Although, it's always packed so I would recommend making reservations or you'll be waiting for hours!"

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lindsay R.,"Memphis, TN",8/7/2019,5.0,"Wonderful! Came here with a colleague last night while we were in Knoxville for business to get food and a few drinks. I had The Billy (pictured)-so good! I love goat cheese and find it hard to make a combo where it tastes good on a burger, but they've done an excellent job. My colleague had The Deadhead and said it was slightly bland. We also shared the fried green tomatoes and I had a few cocktails. Service was great and the atmosphere was good! Joining the Yelp waitlist helped a lot with the short wait. Our table was ready when we arrived walking from a nearby hotel. I would like to come back whenever I visit Knoxville again! There also happened to be an outdoor concert happening outside as we left. Very cute and seemingly safe setting."

We will most definitely be back!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kat F.,"Burlingame, CA",10/25/2020,5.0,"Very glad that we ate here. They serve big portions and food is delicious. The place have a bar but didn't get to try it's selection of drinks. The burgers that we ordered came out as we expected. The kid's meal also came in big portion.

Local beef had wonderful flavor. I ordered the Bernie. Umm, Yum! Brioche bun,  local hamburger cooked to perfection,  blue cheese,  local bacon,  blueberry preserves topped with two batter dipped jalapeno poppers. Service was great. Fries delicious. Atmosphere was fun! We walked around the square where Stock and Barrel are located and it was an experience. Street performers,  cute shops,  a feast for the senses. Will definitely visit again!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David M.,"Spruce Pine, NC",6/26/2021,4.0,"Went here for lunch. Good bar food and drinks. Wings could have been crispier on the outside, but inside was cooked through. Waitress was somewhat attentive, but not overly friendly. Would definitely come back."

We waited for 15 minutes for her to take our order while listing to her manager tell her about some guy and the weekend. Younger employee/management crew and they didn't seem to be too concerned with the customers, just what they had going on outside of work. Several of the tables that came in after us had their drinks and ordered by the time we decided to pay for our drinks and head somewhere else."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Oren S.,"Eastlake, OH",8/30/2020,5.0,"Came from Cleveland, OH, for some of the best burgers around. They practice proper COVID procedures, and even though this place is small we felt comfortable inside. Our server Nick W. was AWESOME! Always checking on us and was super apologetic because they were out of sweet tea and had to brew more. No worries here! This was our first time in Downtown Knoxville and found free parking in the garage behind Market Square, it's free on weekends and evenings after 6:00pmHighly recommend!!!Enjoy!"

Definitely will be back when visiting Knoxville again.  Thanks Stock and Barrel, you surpassed our expectations!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kenneth C.,"Dunwoody, GA",9/5/2021,1.0,"This place is a dump.  One hour for table and 45 minutes for food.  Total closet. Hard to walk.  Basic burgers.  Loud, dirty.  I would avoid at all cost.  Slow non existent service.  Joke.  Don't lose your time."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Andre A.,"Hackensack, NJ",12/10/2021,5.0,BALEIGHHHH LITERALLY THE BEST!!! Today was a first in Tennessee for me and we've been traveling to many states and out of all of them and all the restaurants I've been to eat I've never met a server such as Baleigh!!

Our server Dravin was the best server I have had in my life. He only made great suggestions on appetizers, drinks, and the burgers themselves. He kept us all happy with a difficult (to say the least) group of 10. Consistently kept a smile on his face and checked in the perfect amount of times. He anticipated our needs.  The food and service was top notch! 10 out of 10!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nate H.,"Charlotte, NC",5/15/2019,4.0,"Stock & Barrel is a great burger place in Knoxville located in Market Square. This place is very close to getting five stars. The only reason that I didn't give it the extra star is because the space is so small and cramped. I was coming through Knoxville on my way to Nashville and stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel. Market Square is a short walk from the hotel and this restaurant was recommended by a few people. They were not wrong. This place lives up to the hype. It was very busy on even a Wednesday night, and I was dining alone, so I sat at the bar. Even the bar only had one available seat. Again, that is my only complaint about this place. It is set up as basically one long hallway with a bar. There is outdoor seating, but this place is entirely too cramped for how popular it is. I ordered the 'Merican burger, which is their standard burger that comes with American Cheese, House Pickles, Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, and Mayo. All of their meat is sourced locally in Tennessee and their buns come from a local bakery in Knoxville. All of this attention to ingredients comes through in the food. The burger was perfectly cooked and the meat was tender and juicy. I ordered it medium and it actually came out as true medium, which is not always the case. The bun was almost as good as the burger. It was soft and dusted with flour. The fries were hand cut and crispy. The pickles are homemade as well. I could have eaten a whole jar of those alone. The bartender was very attentive and friendly. They have a great selection of craft beer and bourbon, making this place worth a visit for after work drinks as well. Stock & Barrel is a must stop in Knoxville Tennessee. Their local ingredients used in all of their dishes make this a gourmet burger spot. Expect a wait, because this place is so small, but also keep in mind that there are plenty of bars in Market Square to grab a drink at while you wait. If I am back through Knoxville, this will be my first stop."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ziggy Z.,"Salisbury, NC",5/9/2021,4.0,Great burger!!! Good fries good drink selection. Service wasn't very good. Waiter and hostess all college kids no idea about bourbon. Bar tender didn't have one part of drink and she couldn't make drink a good bartender knows how to replace things and make the drink work. But overall great food.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,J David H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",12/13/2017,4.0,"When arriving in town after a long day of travel I wanted a burger. I yelped burgers and Stock & Barrel appeared to be a fine option in downtown Knoxville. As luck would have it a colleague did the same and I saw her as well. So a spoiler alert, this is worthy of the 4.5 overall rating. Super cool place in a historic building. Seating outside, but it was too cool. I pulled the wooden double doors open and the place presented as I hoped. Wood floors, high ceilings and a bar along the wall. A good lunch crowd was going down. My friend and I elected to sit at the bar. Table and chair seating is on the floor. A female bartender greeted us and brought menus and got waters going ahead of a possible beer order. It did not take me long to decide on a Hardywood Backwoods Bastard after a sample. I honed in on the Steakhouse burger and asked for it medium rare with side of onion rings. Food was in around 15 minutes, or so. The burger must have been a half pound. I nibbled on the onion rings first and loved how they were fried. The onions broke apart without being yucky stringy. The burger was cooked correctly and delightfully delicious. Our server/bartender checked in on us and was fantastic at multi tasking a busy bar. My friends enjoyed their meal as well. We were all happy with the choice. I would definitely return and recommend."

Personally I don't eat red meat so I can't speak to the quality of that, but every time I've gotten a chicken, turkey, fish, or veggie burger it's been on point. The bread is really good and locally made. They generously heap on fries with every burger. The sauces, flavors, and portions are so good! This visit I got the mother clucker and the free bird. Thumbs up to both- the fried chicken in the mother clucker is plentiful, juicy, and crisp. The free bird is just a really solid turkey burger. Avocado, bourbon onions, greens, tomato. What more could you want? I also really like that S&B is very accommodating to additions/subtractions to their menu. You can swap out a different meat patty with any of the burger combinations, which is very appreciated as a non red meat eater. The ambience is comfortable, cool, and they also have a great selection of alcohol. Would recommend for any, but especially burger lovers!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nicole A.,"Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY",9/3/2019,5.0,BASED ON PICK UPOrdered a kids burger and friesOrdered a kids chix and fries Great priceGreat sizeKids loved the chix and fries better than the burger. Fries were so good as well. Friendly workers. Clean spot. Love that it had outdoor seating. We were only there to grab some food on-the-go
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Laurie M.,"White Sulphur Springs, WV",2/13/2021,5.0,Delicious s'mores milkshake!  Fries are perfect and burgers served hot and loaded with fresh toppings.  This was recommended by a local and he was absolutely right.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tiff H.,"Dunwoody, GA",11/17/2017,4.0,"I'm always reminded of Crate & Barrel when I see the name of this restaurant, but it's far from a furniture store. Stock & Barrel is a down to earth pub, with limited seating (especially on game day). While we did make a reservation, we preferred a table by the TVs at the bar, so we ended up grabbing seats at the bar for 4 people when they miraculously opened up. While it was definitely a little difficult to speak from one end of the bar to the other, we were still able to order a few things and share them amongst each other while enjoying the game. Service was friendly - the bartenders were pretty attentive. We ordered mushrooms (Crispy 'Shrooms) and fried feta cheese (Opa!). Both were pretty tasty. The fried mushrooms took some getting used to - the horseradish flavor is pretty heavy. I wasn't a huge fan at first but found myself unable to stop scarfing them down at the end. The fried feta was DELISH. I would have picked up the whole block of honey drizzled cheese and eaten it whole if I could.I ordered a local Knoxville brew to sip on while munching on the fried apps. I'm usually not a red ale type of girl but this was delicious. Blackhorse, you're the dark horse in the running for greatness!Overall, Stock & Barrel is a great place to watch any game if you can get the seats for it. However, when there busy, don't count on it. There are plenty of good apps and burgers to choose from, and don't forget to try some of their beers on tap!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lisa S.,"Siesta Key, FL",11/28/2021,5.0,"This place is awesome!  Obviously it's mostly burgers, so I wouldn't recommend ordering anything besides a burger.  Our family of 4 loved our server and the food.  It was so good we were tempted to go back a few days later."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tiffany A.,"Knoxville, TN",11/27/2020,5.0,"The place is tiny so they usually have long wait times, but it's so worth it! The burgers are absolutely delicious and they have awesome mixed drinks!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cassandra C.,"Cincinnati, OH",7/12/2018,4.0,Great little place to stop when your out shopping in Louisville. I got the chicken sandwich with no bun and a salad. Both were flavorful and filling. All the other burgers sounded amazing and sure smelled good enough to make your mouth water. I liked that the fries were hand cut and the garlic aioli was super tasty.One of my brothers usual stops since he only lives 30 min away.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Barbie W.,"Murphy, NC",5/22/2021,5.0,Great food & quick service. We went on a Friday night and the server was attentive and happy to give recommendations. Will definitely be back if I'm stopping into Knoxville to try some drinks!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael N.,"Atlanta, GA",8/12/2021,1.0,Took 30 minutes longer than the 25 minute wait for an online order. It was two burgers and it took them over an hour to cook them at 2:00 in the afternoon. It was pathetic and extremely overpriced. Stay away
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chris B.,"Danielsville, GA",4/20/2021,5.0,Best burger I've ever had.  Went on a busy night and sat at the bar.  Friendly service and food came out pretty quick.  Highly recommend.  Perfect medium rare.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Reema P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5/20/2019,5.0,I'm pretty big on bourbon and I love black bean burgers! The black bean burgers here are full of flavor and all the burgers are so good and I recently learned you can change it up and get turkey or bison burgers in anything as well as the black bean patty! Stock and Barrel is a family favorite and I always recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Knoxville!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jake K.,"Kingsport, TN",11/11/2021,5.0,"This place has a really cool atmosphere it's very scruffy feeling and the bourbon selection was great. I was also impressed with all the burger options they had, even having a bison burger which is my favorite! Definitely one of the top spots in market square."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Susan B.,"Orlando, FL",8/18/2020,5.0,It feels like a very casual restaurant with a bar but the food and service was fabulous. We started with the Opa! And White Cheddar Pimento Cheese. Yummy! The Ginger-Vitis cocktail was delicious. We had awesome burgers. The kids said the shakes were incredible. The service was great. They also were constantly cleaning. We will be back!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dylan H.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",2/1/2021,1.0,"I'm shocked so many people rate this place so high. Very mediocre burgers. Have been twice now and both times was unimpressed. Southern Grit down the street has a much better burger and they aren't even known for burgers... Asked for medium well and it was rare. Pickles are tasteless. Fries are cold and bland. And to top it off, they put a handful (not an exaggeration) of Mayo. A disgusting amount of Mayo. Could have made a salad dressing with how much Mayo I took off that burger. Not worth $14 that's for sure."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sabrina C.,"Opa-locka, FL",7/3/2019,5.0,"Man what a nice burger. Visiting and ordered the Farmhouse Burger without the cheese and the boyfriend had the Elvis. We updated his fries to the duck confit fries and that was the best decision. What made my Farmhouse burger was that bacon! That bacon was phenomenal, I can wax poetic about that bacon. The salt taste of it, what it provided for every delicious bite of the burger, if you order a burger here have it with the bacon I've never tasted anything like it and it was amazing. The burger meat itself is high quality. You can taste a definite difference in great quality meat and it was seasoned nicely. Would say this is one of the better burgers I've had. The star of these burgers is the meat itself and I would even say that freaking bacon they put in. The duck confit fries are the bomb too, that green onion with it is chefs kiss. Would say order that with any of the burgers if you can. If we get a chance while we're here we'd definitely come back. A good burger for us Miami people is always a great pull."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Craig P.,"Greenville, SC",6/20/2019,4.0,Great burger. Had the hurt locker. Nice fries. Good service. Cold beer. Neat location. Good service.Not much.more to say. Just an overall good bar.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike K.,"Sunbury, OH",4/25/2019,5.0,"The food was really good and the staff was friendly.  This place is super busy so my suggestion is dine early. I gave them the benefit of the doubt,  with my 5 star rating because my experience was not perfect but it was good. I sat at the bar because of the long wait which is really not the best place to sit if you don't drink. The girls were nice but bartenders in a place like this are the busiest people on staff plus you have to sit in between 2 strangers.  I enjoyed the blue cheese burger and onion rings. I will stop back again but next time I will sit at a table."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brandi K.,"Springfield, MO",7/22/2019,5.0,We just killed the Bernie and the 'Merican' burgers! I wish I would have taken a photo because they were BEAutiful!They just looked too good not to dig into right away! We ordered them medium rare and they were cooked perfectly. I had the onion rings as a side and the fiancé had fries. I recommend the fries but I'm a huge fry girl so you may not want to take my word for it. We definitely recommend a visit here...come hungry because the burgers are the kind of good that you don't want to leave any left.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Janna C.,"Houlton, WI",3/29/2021,5.0,Best over-the-top burgers and their wedge salad my favorite. It does get crowded but that is testament to their great food and quick service.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jamie B.,"Milwaukee, WI",3/22/2020,5.0,"Such good food. The Elvis peanut butter and fried banana on a burger is odd, but tasty as hell. Definitely get the onion rings, they're huge but not dense. I like the chicken and waffle sandwich, but next time I would get the syrup on the side. This was a fun stop in Knoxville for a day trip in the South!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Will M.,"Lexington, KY",6/21/2020,5.0,Very good burgers from locally sourced meat.  Started off with fried pickles that they make in house and a local beer.  I got the Elvis which was a burger with peanut butter and fried banana peppers and I was in heaven!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Glen C.,"Bristol, TN",7/3/2020,5.0,"Found a near perfect burger.  This place is small but has a delicious taste. Everything from the homemade fries to onion rings to the classic burger with garlic aioli sauce were all absolutely scrumptious!David, the bar tender was the best server one could ask for! Even let me taste test a few beers. Chose a local IPA, nice...Thanks guys, great job!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alyssa T.,"Columbus, OH",1/9/2021,2.0,"My review may not be the most helpful, all we ordered were milkshakes. Im from cbus, Ohio and I was really excited about the s'mores shake having all the toppings included. We got them to go because ~covid~ and I was disappointed that my $7 milkshake didn't come with any toppings at all. They could have atleast let us know when we ordered that it would be an issue. So I payed premium price for a vanilla milkshake basically, didn't even taste like s'mores."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katherine C.,"Spring Hill, TN",3/17/2021,5.0,Oh my burgers!!  This place is legit. We were driving from Nashville to the Smokies and did a quick check on Yelp for yummy lunch.  I'm going to make a BOLD statement...best burger I've had in my 49 years!  I had the Steakhouse Burger.  I'll dream about it tonight no doubt.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Timothy G.,"Huntsville, AL",3/17/2020,5.0,"Came here for me and my girlfriend for our first anniversary. Even with everything going on, David was super welcoming and friendly, even making some fun jokes along the way. Very prompt with service and we never went without. I got the Greek burger and she got the Bison burger, which were both suggested. Seriously amazing. Fast, cooked perfectly, great portions. I seriously have nothing of fault I can say about this place. 10/10, definitely on the list of regular places to go."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mindy M.,"Jacksonville, FL",6/9/2017,5.0,"Oh my goodness. I don't know that there are words to describe how incredibly good Stock and Barrel is.  First let's talk about the atmosphere. The low lights, exposed brick and low hum of the crowd provides a really fantastic feel. The tables are close together but you never feel crowded. The drink menu is extensive and the drinks are really well crafted. We had an old fashioned and a bourbon fizz. I have had several really great old fashioned s and this one tops my list. The bourbon fizz isn't my thing because it's sweeter but several people in our group loved it. I ordered the Bernie with the tomato salad and my husband got the Elvis with the famous duck confit fries. This is the second time we have visited and ordered the same thing which is a rarity for us.  I will say my Bernie the second time around wasn't as good as the first but it was a Saturday and very busy. It was still incredible. The buns are soft not soggy, the meat is juicy not greasy and the fried jalapeños did not disappoint. The duck fries are just the right amount of crispy. We also ordered the crab dip- it was just ok, nothing to go on about. The fried green tomatoes were delightful! Nice balsamic drizzle and not overly greasy. I have had a lot of incredible burgers (here's to you hash house a go go and cowfish) but S&B is a clear winner in my book. Just make sure you use the app to reserve a table ahead of time- this place gets busy!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Julia C.,"Morristown, TN",3/6/2021,5.0,Wow!!! Amazing!! Well worth the long wait time! The all American burger was amazing with high quality ingredients. The chicken sandwich was huge!! The fries where all natural and fresh. The onion rings where crisp and scrumptious.. if you like onion rings this is the place to go!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amanda S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7/5/2021,5.0,"My husband and I first tried Stock & Barrel during a weekend trip to Knoxville and loved it, and after we moved there a few months later, it became our favorite restaurant in town.  The burgers are consistently excellent, always cooked perfectly and well-seasoned.  My husband loves the Black & Blue burger, and I have enjoyed both the Hurt Locker and the 'Merican (which I add fried jalapenos and crispy onion straws to).  The extensive list of add ons you can select from for your burger is awesome, and the sides are just as delicious as the burgers themselves.  The onion rings are my favorite - light, crispy, flavorful batter that's not too greasy and doesn't fall off when you bite into it.  The village tomato salad, fried pickles, and duck fries are standouts as well.  We moved away from Knoxville a while back, and any time we find ourselves back in town, we always have to make a visit here!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Martin H.,"Maryville, TN",11/24/2020,2.0,"Disappointing. Expensive for what you get.  We've heard about this place for a while and finally tried it. It is supposed to be a great burger restaurant. It is not. We went on a Monday afternoon. They were about 25% full. We were immediately seated at the wobbliest table I've ever seen in a restaurant. The table was inexcusably wobbly. We asked to move and were seated at a high top. It was firmly attached to both the floor and a wall. It also had tiny uncomfortable, stackable, metal stools. These stools belonged in a children's shop class, not a restaurant serving adults.  After we moved, the wobbly table was cleaned and I watched it wobble and tilt while being wiped down.  We noticed that another customer was seated at the same wobbly table. Keeping that table inside the restaurant is managerial ineptitude.  Our waiter was friendly and service was excellent.The menu names the suppliers of the meat, buns etc. I guess it's supposed to make you believe you are in for an exceptional burger experience. In reality it only increases the disappointment.We started with the duck fat fries. They were delicious. The duck fat fries came with a side of ketchup and a side of a sauce similar to thousand island. Both were superfluous. The duck fat fries are rich, no heavy condiment necessary. We tried two different burgers. Both were cooked perfectly. The buns are nearly spherical, shaped like a big creampuff. The buns look silly and when all is said and done were less desirable than a supermarket hamburger bun. They were sliced well above the center line, nearly skimming the crust, leaving a top of the bun that was much smaller than the full diameter of the bun. The toppings were haphazardly applied and skewed to one side of the burger. Some of my bites were delicious, some were just meat and bun. The top bun, since it was sliced so thin got soggy quick and as I ate the burger, my fingers were holding the patty more than the bun which was not pleasant. The burgers were ordered with onion rings. The onion rings were bland and oily. I'd never order the onion rings again and will probably skip the burgers too. For a restaurant that specializes in burgers, it felt mediocre and thrown together without much care. I have eaten out about 300 meals a year for over 30 years. I have a good idea of what to expect from a restaurant. What really frustrates me about a place like this is that they are a burger restaurant. They are championed as a burger restaurant.  The menu is basically burgers and yet they deliver a burger meal that is mediocre at best.  I am not a professional cook. I don't work in a restaurant and I don't sell burgers for a living. Somehow I can consistently make a burger better than what I was served at Stock and Barrel."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,MaryChris F.,"Louisville, KY",6/21/2020,5.0,FYI: before i start this review.. if you are coming here and the waitlist is open- JUMP ON IT... or you will be waiting awhile. we stopped here on our way back from asheville and it was amazing. from their social distancing precautions to drinks and bourbon selection.. everything was SUPERB. huge food proportions and lots of burgers to pick from. if you are ready for a good bourbon drink and burger... come here!!! you will NOT be disappointed.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sierra M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/29/2021,5.0,"Excellent food and atmosphere! It was well worth the wait! The beer was cold, the menu was a good selection, and the service was AMAZING! We loved sitting in Market Square and exploring while we waited for our table."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jamie W.,"Asheville, NC",4/11/2019,5.0,This place lived up to the hype! We had an excellent burger and crispy hand cut fries with a side of onion rings. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly to order! Our server was perfect! Next time we are in Knoxville will definitely be back!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vu N.,"Knoxville, TN",3/30/2021,4.0,A great place to grab a burger in Knoxville. But that's about it. I tried some of their sides and they weren't too bad or great. But I don't think people come here for their sides.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cortney K.,"Louisville, KY",6/22/2017,5.0,"Having never been to Knoxville before I turned to Yelp to search good restaurants downtown near our hotel. That's how I came upon Stock and Barrel.After flipping through a few Yelp photos I knew this was the spot for lunch. We arrive on a Saturday around 12:30 and they were packed. We were told 30 minutes so we enjoyed a walk around the plaza. After 20 minutes I received a text that my table was ready. We place our drink order of local beer and s'mores milkshake. I definitely had the envy of the tables around when my large milkshake showed up. It was so delicious and they even toasted the few marshmallows in it!  Couldn't believe this delightful thing was only $5.After seeing the burgers coming out for our neighbors we decided to split an app and burger. We picked the cheese dip with homemade pita chips and the hurt locker burger with pimento cheese and bacon. We also substituted the onion rings for the fries. We couldn't stop eating and eventually we're so full we had to go back to the hotel to take a nap. For $35, we definitely had a fabulous feast in a hip restaurant."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Natasha P.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/26/2018,4.0,"So the reason why I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 stars is because their customer service can use some work. Our server forgot about us a couple of times. I was waiting at one point for 20 minutes.Best burger and fry joint in Knoxville...period. You have to get the Duck Confit fries. I, honestly believe it is the star item of the menu, even over the burgers.They have so many different type of burgers that you can think of and even for vegans/vegetarians. If you are a burger person, you have to visit this place. Also, mac n cheese is definitely a must here!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Quaheem B.,"Houston, TX",8/6/2020,5.0,"A colleague of mine recommended this place to me and my buddy. We were just looking for a snack while we were out on the town. We decided to split a burger little did I know it would be the best burger I have had in a long time! The quality of the beef was A+ the bun was paired perfectly. ""Cue the Gospel Music that causes the older women in the hat to catch the Holy Ghost"". Man next time I am in Knoxville for sure will be going back here. The Whiskey was also great and made in house. Food and Service get this place a 15/10"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tanya S.,"Hixson, Chattanooga, TN",1/18/2020,4.0,"Knoxville and Chattanooga are not far from each other but we do not go there that often. My daughter is a musician and once a year we go there for All east auditions. And we have the chance to spend all day in Knoxville. We play music, eat and enjoy nature. This time our choice for our  restaurant was clear. This is an amazing restaurant. It has such great reviews. And we decided to go. We absolutely love this place. My daughter, my friend and I, we all ordered different hamburgers, and they were so tasty! The food is amazing! And it was served fast even with the restaurant being full of people. We even tried a dessert. We love all the things about this place! We will be back again and I will highly recommend it to all our friends!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matt R.,"Oak Ridge, TN",2/6/2020,5.0,"S&B has the best burgers in town.  I prefer the Steakhouse burger with A1 and bacon.  My wife prefers the farmhouse with egg and the works.  We don't drink but the folks around us seem to really  enjoy the various bourbons available!  The have several drink options and the largest selection of bourbons so if that is your thing, take a swing on by Stock and Barrel."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matthew J.,"Nashville, TN",10/14/2020,5.0,"Great place to eat and drink, I had the old fashioned and the steakhouse burger. They were both perfectly mixed and amazingly delicious. Must have for a bite to eat and a great drink!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Renee R.,"Murfreesboro, TN",2/12/2020,5.0,"Wow just wow! Food was absolutely fantastic. I got the billy burger and the bison burger with the duck fries. Our son got the Mac and cheese. I had the option of onion rings, fries or half and half. I was smiling ear to ear when I heard that option so of course I picked half and half. Both onion rings and fries were amazing. To top it off- the hostess was super sweet and happy to welcome us and our waitress was just as nice. She was attentive and happy."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Winnie L.,"Palo Alto, CA",6/5/2021,1.0,Most kids-unfriendly place ever!!!  Don't come here if you have kids of young age.  They treat you badly and think you are cumbersome.  Avoid at all cost!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matt T.,"Myakka City, FL",2/16/2020,1.0,Have no idea if their food is any good. But their check in process sucks. We were quoted 20 maybe 30 min top. 45 min later we were told yelp people can jump the list. We got the notification our table was ready an hour and a half in... we already had our order in at Mellow Mushroom in Turkey Creek.  Screw Stock and Barrel. Pic for proof.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sann F.,"Louisville, KY",10/14/2020,5.0,"The pictures don't lie, this place is fabulous!We grabbed two seats at the bar because the restaurant was full and had the best service from Austin, our bartender.After picking his brain we went with the fried pickles as the appetizer, chicken and waffles, and the Bernie burger.All was as good as any review will tell you. Definitely will be back when visiting Knoxville again.  Thanks Stock and Barrel, you surpassed our expectations!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matthew J.,"Nashville, TN",10/14/2020,5.0,"Great place to eat and drink, I had the old fashioned and the steakhouse burger. They were both perfectly mixed and amazingly delicious. Must have for a bite to eat and a great drink!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John K.,"Stafford, VA",10/13/2020,5.0,I'm so glad this bar is still able to operate during COVID! Driving through Knoxville and stopped at Stock & Barrel for a bite to eat. What a pleasant surprise. They offer a great atmosphere with gourmet craft burgers using locally grown products. Also offer a wide range of bourbon to choose from. They also have craft beer for you beer lovers.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,R.T. D.,"Joelton, TN",10/12/2020,2.0,"I couldn't have picked a worse time to decide I wanted a really good hamburger.While driving through Knoxville because of the great reviews I decided to stop at the stock and barrel.I went in and was immediately put on guard because of the huge number of people in the restaurant with no masks.I wish I had turned around and left instead of ordering a hamburger although they did make an effort to do distancing at the bar.the place was so crowded it was like stepping into a covid petri dish.After visiting the ladies' Room which was absolutely disgusting and filthy, I decided it wasn't worth waiting for a hamburger.Just as I was about to leave the food arrived.I have now spent the last several days wondering if symptoms were going to arrive as well.fortunately they have not however the lack of concern and enforcement in this restaurant is appalling .I won't be returning and hamburger really wasn't worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason K.,"SC, SC",10/9/2020,5.0,"Got the spicy crab dip, pimento cheese, two burgers and two kids dinners. All great quality, taste, and all very fresh. Quick service considering it's all made to order.  Worth the wait in case there's a long line!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jonny M.,"Franklin, TN",10/6/2020,5.0,"One of the best Old Fashioneds I've had in a while.  And I had the Elvis burger with peanut butter and bacon and fried bananas.  Yes please!Great vibe, great service, great food, great cocktails.  5 stars all around!"

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lisa K.,"Jefferson City, TN",9/27/2020,4.0,"our first visit here, been wanting to try for a while, Sunday afternoon, late lunch, sat at the Bar, NFL football was on, beer was cold, i hit American Burger it was very filling, had to cut into half to eat, my husband got Bison burger, was good , homemade fries, very good... it you want a burger i would suggest trying it out..."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Payal P.,"Carrollton, TX",12/9/2018,3.0,"Disclaimer - I am vegetarian and prefer not to eat burgers (even veggie burgers in a restaurant setting) so my review would be biased to what this place has to offer.The mac n cheese had a smoky flavor that I personally wasn't a fan of. I wish it were a little more cheesy. Felt it was a bit dry. Overall okay, but I was disappointed.The black bean and corn salad was good. It was light. Missing a bit of seasoning. Felt it could've had more flavor in terms of spices/seasoning (not salt). Dressing was ok, more oil than herbs.I'd come back to try the crazy milkshakes, but would most likely not eat here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,erin w.,"San Antonio, TX",7/14/2021,4.0,Really really good burgers.  Small outdoor seating area but man the burgers are good.  Got the Bernie and it did not disappoint.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rocky B.,"Guthrie, OK",3/13/2020,4.0,OK. I would've given a 5-star rating except for one thing:  the music is too loud.  Nobody goes to a restaurant to listen to music; or at least few do.  Most people go to eat and visit w friends and loves ones. But the food and service? 5-star all the way.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Betty G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/11/2021,3.0,The food was wonderful though one meal came with the set up/cheese that we requested not to have. The service was below par. We were outside and I believe our sever did not realize he had a table because we were still waiting 30 minutes for him to show up and another 15 to get our beverages. Different help brought us out food and we had to wait a long time to pay as well. I really hope this was just a one-off. We've been here before and have had a wonderful experiences but tonight was lacking
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Saba S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/23/2018,4.0,"Stock & Barrel is a great addition to Market Square. The food is consistent, and the bourdon selection is beyond impressive. I highly recommend the Duck Confit Fries appetizer. In addition to the many beef burgers, the menu also includes a turkey burger, bison burger, and black bean/quinoa burger.Indoor seating is pretty limited. We always go on weekdays because the wait is so long on weekends. The restaurant is also somewhat noisy, so not a good choice for a romantic date. If you're up for good whiskey and creative burgers in a causal setting, definitely give Stock & Barrel a try!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mallorie N.,"Henderson, NV",1/3/2019,4.0,"4 stars because food and service were really good, though my husband's burger was pretty undercooked for medium-well tbh. Chill atmosphere.. the artwork was quirky and cute and the vibe was still family-friendly even with the obvious beers circulating, so that was cool. I was searching for a reason to give it a 5/5, but nothing stood out enough at the moment. Would probably recommend and return if I'm ever nearby again though!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Buckeye C.,"Maineville, OH",2/8/2021,5.0,Had the Texas Walker Ranger burger. Sooo yummy. Loved it. Great burgers s as bud shakes.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Russell H.,"Louisville, KY",8/7/2021,4.0,"We stopped here on our way to Gatlinburg. It was a Saturday and the local farmers market was taking place in the market. The restaurant had a 30 min wait but ended up more like 20. We started with the pimento cheese spread. It was served in an iron skillet, hot and creamy. It had a little sweetness from the tomato jam but went well with the crusty pita chips. The main course was the mushroom burger and the bison burger. The horseradish sauce on the shroom burger would be better served on the side but it was a tasty burger! The bison burger was really too notch. The creamy cheese and crispy onions really enhanced the flavors. We also had fries and onion rings, both were excellent. Overall, if you're in the area, great spot to grab a bite."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah M.,"Reno, NV",11/13/2016,4.0,"We were looking for a good burger joint coming back from Gatlinburg this weekend and we found it in Stock & Barrel. With the good Yelp reviews it was a no-brainer. I put our name on the waitlist when we were 3 miles away as the app allowed. It was easy to get to and super trendy. They had a huge bourbon selection and although we didn't indulge, it looked extensive. They had burgers of every time. Lamb, turkey, beef, bison, etc. It's whatever stroked your fancy, they had it. Their beef is locally grown and the buns are homemade locally as well. I decided to order the 'Merican and opted for the pepperjack cheese instead of the cheddar. The fries weren't anything exciting but  the burger was good. The patio seating was a great touch and there seemed to be lots of cute boutiques near by.I took the rest of my burger to go to get a nutella milkshake and it was everything I thought it would be. Super tasty and refreshing."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Faith B.,"Milwaukee, WI",4/7/2017,4.0,"Visited here with my mom right after moving to town. We got put on the waiting list through the Yelp app. Alas, we were a couple minutes late after some parking confusion and got dropped from the list. We lucked out when the next people on the list released their table.So, finally seated, we were stoked for a bourbon experience for the scrapbook.We ordered burgers, of course. I was impressed to learn you can order any burger on the menu as a veggie burger. I got the mushroom one and it was excellent. The fries were very tasty. My mom enjoyed her burger as well.We ordered drinks and they were fine. They were well balanced and entirely satisfactory, just not great. The liquor selection is impressive though, so maybe it's worth another try. Every place can have an off night.I did find the nearly $60 tab a little excessive though for 2 drinks and 2 burgers."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michelle R.,"Hanover Park, IL",7/1/2021,5.0,"Another restaurant I selected prior to my visit because of what everyone posted but unlike some of the others, I was not disappointed. Fantastic burgers paired with a cold beer you can't go wrong. Thank you to all of the servers for making it a pleasure. They were all amazing."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paige B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/31/2021,1.0,"I have never had such trouble with a restaurant until today. I work at UT Medical Center and placed a delivery order through Uber Eats to be delivered for my coworker and myself. The order was placed at 10:00 AM before they opened. By 11:15, I got a notification saying my order was canceled because they were too busy and couldn't fill my order. Why was my order less important than the customers inside the restaurant? Why was my order not made first thing, before they even had customers? When I tried calling, I was hung up on twice. We finally got through to the manager and she claims they never saw my order and that Saturday's are busy and they usually turn off the to-go ordering. If you can't fulfill to-go orders, don't claim to offer such a service. Don't have a contract with Uber Eats if you can't uphold your end of the bargain."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jared S.,"Seymour, TN",1/30/2021,5.0,"It's a little busy, but there's a reason! You can literally order anything on the menu and you'll be smiling. I suggest ""The Billy"". It's an amazing burger with goat cheese and tomato jam. I rate it the best burger in East Tn."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Carlos H.,"Knoxville, TN",11/20/2020,5.0,"We always heard how good it was and they didn't disappoint. Burgers, salads, onion rings, and fried green tomatoes were all outstanding. I did a Turkey Burger and it was the best I've ever had. Excellent service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chris L.,"Rome City, IN",6/27/2021,5.0,"Wonderful burgers, great service. Many different burger combinations, the Elvis and the Bernie were awesome"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Caitlin C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/9/2020,2.0,"I have eaten at Stock and Barrel multiple times and there is no denying the food is delicious. Of course, the biggest hurdle is the long wait times due to the popularity and small space. My mom visited this weekend and due to COVID, we wanted takeout. I thought this would be a great chance to get Stock and Barrel since I rarely get to eat it there. We called in an order and they stated the wait would be 20-30 minutes and to come in to the hostess stand and pick up. No problem. Well, as soon as I arrived 30 min later I realized things were not looking great. The restaurant was PACKED. I mean as crowded and crazy as it normally is pre-COVID. This concerned me because the website states they are operating at 50% capacity. A group of eight young college kids were crowding the doorway wanting to sit at the bar. This made it incredibly difficult to get inside and, again, SO CROWDED. I finally reached the hostess and she found my order and I wanted to pay with cash and I saw she looked hesitant so I immediately offered to pay with card! She said it was no problem and she would return with my change. A couple minutes passed and she returned with no change. She mumbled something about having to wait. I waited ELEVEN minutes for my change, all while having nowhere to safely wait and holding my heavy bag of food. When my mom and I were heading home we realized they forget the pie! So, after all that, we had to turn around and ask for our forgotten food. At that time, I saw the same girl from earlier waiting for ketchup.I know COVID has affected everyone, especially small businesses, but it really, really should NOT be this hard to get take out! Everyone has their opinions on what is safe or not but getting food to go, when you have had MONTHS to perfect this option, was really unacceptable."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Madison L.,"Knoxville, TN",1/26/2021,5.0,Staff is great and the food is amazing. I definitely recommend the chicken and waffles.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jennifer J.,"Germantown, MD",11/13/2020,5.0,"When I tell you this place is all that and some! Omg everything was so good we didn't even get pictures. We ordered the Mother Clicker, Chicken and Waffle and a burger with duck fries and a side of mac. Everything was amazing.  I mean amazing the chicken was crispy and juicy. The burger was cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Debbie B.,"North Richland Hills, TX",6/20/2021,5.0,"Just came for lunch based on Yelp review. Loved the fact that I could put my name on the waitlist through Yelp; eliminating  the wait. We ordered a wedge salad and the Hurtlocker burger; both were delicious! Would order both again except there are many more great sounding options to try! The onion rings were the real star of the meal, in my opinion!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amanda W.,"Oakhurst, CA",1/26/2020,4.0,Awesome food and great service so worth the wait you won't be sorry. Every time I'm in Tennessee I come and eat here
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Annie M.,"Cleveland, OH",6/9/2018,5.0,"Best Burger I've had in a very long time.  I'll admit that I was very skeptical of a burger joint with almost an hour long wait both times that I tried going there...luckily this time there were open seats at the bar so I didn't have to wait and ooooooh, boy, are these burgers tasty!I was actually really happy to sit at the bar, as I got a corner seat next to the wall so I was not in the hustle and bustle of the restaurant.  There were two bartenders who both took great care of us.  They were attentive, yet gave us our space-the perfect balance.  We started with cocktails (which seemed a bit overpriced until I saw the bill which said my $8 whiskey ginger was made with Buffalo Trace) which were simple and delicious.  I appreciate a cocktail that I can actually taste the whiskey/bourbon, that's my liquor of choice for a reason, I like the flavor...For dinner, I ordered the Hurt Locker Burger with pimento cheese, Benton's bacon, Friend green tomatoes and bourbon onions, and my husband ordered The Billy, with goat cheese, onions, tomato jam and Benton's bacon.  We split them of course.  Both were ABSOLUTELY FRICKIN' DELICIOUS!  The Billy was sweet and smooth and the Hurt Locker was a tad spicy and tangy.  We ordered them medium temperature and were cooked perfectly, with red, juicy centers.  I'm drooling right now just thinking about them.  For sides, we ordered fries and onion rings. The fries were meh, I think I got the bottom of the barrel because it was a ton of itty bitty pieces but the onion rings were dang good, thick cut onions, flavorful batter.  I am looking forward to going back here again asap and trying their other burgers.  I'm super intrigued by The Elvis with fried bananas and peanut butter and the Shroomin' with horseradish, cheese and a bunch of different mushrooms.  I'll be back soon!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lois G.,"Inverness, IL",11/29/2020,5.0,PHENOMENAL burger. I got The Billy. So so flavorful and the cheese works so well with the flavors. I also added crispy onions and jalapeños. Definitely on my top ten best burger list!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Johnny K.,"Dayton, OH",9/9/2019,5.0,"My favorite burger, by far, up till now, has been the Primetime burger from Hopdoddy. It is a deliciously decadent and sublime burger!But now, there is a clear contender for title of Best Burger (Ever) (in the Universe).  And it goes by the name of ""The Hurt Locker"" burger at the Stock & Barrel. And what a sublime and majestic burger this is!! The meat is every bit as delicious and velvety as the grass-fed Kobe meat on the Primetime.The pimento cheese atop The Hurt Locker is almost like a whipped frothy cheese, melty and delicious and oozing off the top of the burger!The fried green tomato is a sublime addition! As are the caramelized bourbon onions. And the bacon on the burger is excellent!!Highly HIGHLY recommended!!!(And the fries were excellent too!!)"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Darryl L.,"Elk Grove, CA",11/23/2019,5.0,"Great burgers and great people.We were in the area for training and decide to stop by for a bite to eat. To our surprise we were brought these beautiful burgers and ate ourselves happy. Really were pleasantly surprised how good the burgers really were. So burgers are just burgers, but Stock and Barrel burgers are masterpieces!!Thanks to the staff for the superior serviceDarryl LinerPremier Martial Arts"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,R.T. D.,"Joelton, TN",10/12/2020,2.0,"I couldn't have picked a worse time to decide I wanted a really good hamburger.While driving through Knoxville because of the great reviews I decided to stop at the stock and barrel.I went in and was immediately put on guard because of the huge number of people in the restaurant with no masks.I wish I had turned around and left instead of ordering a hamburger although they did make an effort to do distancing at the bar.the place was so crowded it was like stepping into a covid petri dish.After visiting the ladies' Room which was absolutely disgusting and filthy, I decided it wasn't worth waiting for a hamburger.Just as I was about to leave the food arrived.I have now spent the last several days wondering if symptoms were going to arrive as well.fortunately they have not however the lack of concern and enforcement in this restaurant is appalling .I won't be returning and hamburger really wasn't worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kevin F.,"Tallahassee, FL",12/5/2019,4.0,"I visited this location while on a business trip. I met a friend here as he lives in the area. The ambiance is pretty cool - I love the way it is laid out and decorated. My only complaint here is that the tables are sooooo close together. We had to pull our table out in order to get to the seat against the back wall, otherwise we would have bumped the neighboring table (besides, no one wants a pair of pants sliding across the side of your table as you're trying to eat...).Food came out quickly, but honestly, I was underwhelmed. The hype on this place is huge, and the menu offerings are pretty unique. Unfortunately, my burger was pretty small compared to my bun and everything lacked, ever so slightly, the seasoning needed to make it sing. I'd definitely come back. It was slammed when I visited and while my experience wasn't 5-stars, there are enough of them in their reviews to tell me it's certainly attainable there."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Connor M.,"Knoxville, TN",11/21/2019,5.0,"Easily the second best burger I have ever had, and a great choice for my twenty first.The duck confit fries are to die for, and I highly recommend that you at least get them to split with the table. When I first tried them, I assumed that they would be THE FRIES but then I tried their non-duck fries, and I'm happy to say that they are also absolutely delicious.I ordered the Bernie burger and the Blackberry Reserve (I think that's the name) beer, both were phenomenal. The Bernie burgers cheese was perfectly affected by the raspberry sauce. The bun was light and delicious, and the patty was flavorful in its own right.The gluten free bun is also delicious-I tried my cousin's. I would recommend not making her mistake and getting egg. While the bun is great (it feels almost like cornbread), it easily falls apart.Overall, I'm incredibly glad I came here- and I will be back. Hopefully soon."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley S.,"Oakland, CA",11/13/2019,4.0,"This was a tasty place to eat at during our (very brief) stop in Knoxville. Even though it as busy, we were sat immediately. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly. I ordered a cocktail called ""Ginger-vitis"" (lol) and my husband grabbed a beer. We started with the crispy shrooms and they were delicious but also there are a ton of them. It was a huge plate! I ordered the wedge salad and hubs ordered the ""bernie"" burger. Both were really tasty. It's always nice to be able to find a hearty wedge salad with bacon and crispy onions and just enough blue cheese! Hubs loved his burger which had blue cheese, blueberry preserves and fried jalapenos! Both were large portions! Plus it's in a super cute little town square area!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah P.,"San Francisco, CA",1/12/2021,5.0,I don't ever leave reviews but these burgers were sent from heaven. The burger with goat cheese was unmatched. I think about this burger a lot. I also loved that they had gluten free buns! It's hard to find good gf food in Knoxville.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Crashley R.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",12/11/2020,5.0,"I had The Wedge and it was amazing! My my mom ordered onion rings and they were huge but scrumptious none the less. Also the French fries were definitely homemade and delicious. My brother who generally sticks to the simple plain burger and fries tried The Elvis and he loved it. We also tried the Crab dip and it was delicious, 100% recommend. Absolutely amazing!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jasmine N.,"Memphis, TN",9/9/2019,5.0,"I've been to plenty of burger places in Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville and I can say with full confidence that Stock and Barrel has the best burgers in all of Tennessee. The farmhouse burger ($12) is my forever go-to burger here. The egg is so perfectly cooked with just the right amount of yolk running on the sides. That bacon is incredibly delicious - thick cut that truly makes the burger come together. The onion rings were super crispy and fried with perfection. This came with the meal. The bison burger ($16) is a lot of people's favorites I know. The meat in both of the burgers was so tender and juicy. The duck fries were included with this meal! That creamy cheese in the bison burger made it all come together. Even if you don't get the bison burger ALWAYS upgrade to duck fries with any burger purchase - I want to say it's an additional $4 charge but 10000% worth it. The fries were cooked in duck fat with cheese and green onion garnished on it served in a bucket. best fries I've ever tasted in my life. Towards the bottom of the bucket is where you really taste the duck fat and man it is delicious. My friend and I came on a Saturday at noon and was seated in 30 min outside. such a wonderful vibe with a view of the farmers market happening. I've been here for lunch and dinner multiple times and have always waited at least 15 min for a table everytime no matter how many people eat. it's a pretty small restaurant in the first place but 100% worth the wait!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bo C.,"Lilburn, GA",12/17/2018,5.0,"This place is money! In town for just one night and stumbled arcoss this excellent place. First it was a Monday night and this place was hopping but with no wait. It's a small restaurant but the atmosphere is amazing. They are known for their harder liquors but I got a great Hefewizen on draft.I was a bit stuck on what to order as I'm a huge burger snob but they has several that looked great. I asked my waitress and she recommended the ""Bernie"" which was on my list. It has huge pieces of bacon, fried jalapenos, blue cheese and a blueberry sauce. It was hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had! I also had the duck fries which are mentioned in several other reviews, they were great as well!! Oh and part of my burger snobiness is how it's cooked. I like medium rare and the cooked nailed it!!Highly recommend!!My only complaint is I'm in a hotel and can't take my left overs!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael M.,"Columbia, SC",8/25/2018,4.0,"I was excited to try this place because everyone raves about it. I was a bit disappointed. The burgers are definitely above average. Flavorful, interesting, fresh.It wasn't close to the best burger I've had. Not even the best burger in the past month. The fries are terrible. Flimsy, greasy, flavorless. The rings are pretty good. The fried pickles are excellent.I was not sure if I should give this place a 3 or of I'm being too hard on it because the hype gave me u realistic expectations. The service is decent, the beer overpriced, and the burgers are very good, not great."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,C A.,"Knoxville, TN",7/6/2021,5.0,This is the go-to place whenever I wanna eat out with my friends in Knoxville. The servers are pretty friendly and patient. Food is great with a wide selection.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sandi F.,"Summerfield, NC",10/26/2020,4.0,"Had the Black Betty & the Shroomin. Delicious. Added onions & spicy mustard. Imma a onion ring aficionado. They were fantastic,l! Great customer service. Waitlist is great to use for outside seating."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,StratSwede S.,"Arlington, VA",12/1/2019,5.0,"This is a small joint with a limited menu and an outstanding whisky selection. I ordered a burger medium rare, it was served medium well - no surprise I sent it back. The replacement. Are quickly and was cooked perfectly- mistake fixed. The food was very good and the whiskey was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant if you like burgers and whisky!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Caitlyn T.,"Knoxville, TN",8/21/2020,5.0,I'm new-ish to Knoxville and I went here and got the Hurt Locker Burger and it was amazinggg! The staff were light hearted and very friendly. Will definitely go back here!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kimberly L.,"Nashville, TN",9/1/2019,5.0,"Uhhh-mazing hamburgers and fries! The patties are huge, fresh, and cooked to order perfectly. Onion rings were crispy and full of flavor, recommend ordering just to try! Their hand cut fries are incredibly tasty, definitely a top 5 favorite! Also great beer selection, environment and great service!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Iva C.,"Knoxville, TN",10/28/2018,5.0,"This place is at the top of my list for having the best burgers in Knoxville. There are so many different burgers to choose from and each one sounds delicious. It's always hard to choose, but no matter what you order you will not be disappointed. My favorites so far have been the Hurt Locker, the Billy, and recently I tried the Elvis- a burger with peanut butter, fried bananas, and bacon! I know it sounds strange but trust me, it's delicious!! Don't knock it until you try it! The fries are perfectly seasoned and crispy too. This place is such a treat. Next time I would like to try one of their milkshakes because I have heard they are outstanding. I always look forward to coming here!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nathan T.,"West Lafayette, IN",6/19/2018,5.0,"Arriving in Knoxville on a busy Friday night, my friend and I weren't sure where to go. We turned to Yelp and saw the wonderful reviews here and decided we would give it a shot, but we might not wait if it was too long. We added ourselves to the waitlist here and explored a little until our check in time was up. I checked in amidst people being told they would have a 50 minute wait, and we were seated immediately. Thanks to yelp for facilitating this quick seating! The beer here was top notch. Some local, some cheap, some both. It was a great addition to our burgers! Speaking of the burgers, this was easily the best one I've ever had. I don't make that statement lightly, I like my burgers. But thinking back on this one is making me want to go back to Knoxville just for it. I chose the Bernie as it sounded interesting with a wide variety of ingredients. They nailed it. The burger itself was cooked perfectly. Most places take medium to mean well done, but not here! The meat had a perfect amount of pink in it and it was very juicy. All of the ingredients played together almost in a way that made them indistinguishable. You can tell some thought has gone into it. The blueberry preserves and the jalapeños played off of each other nearly as perfectly as the bacon and bleu cheese crumbles. All together they were simply sensational. And served alongside some wonderful onion rings! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Carey W.,"Lewisville, TX",7/14/2019,5.0,"Wonderful burgers! Definitely a gourmet burger place but the $ is totally worth it. Great staff too!The Black & Blue burger is so good!And the onion rings are so fresh, with a great batter!"

As a visitor to Knoxville, I was not impressed."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael G.,"TN, TN",7/12/2021,3.0,First time back since COVID stuff. The food was great as usual. We were seated promptly BUT no one even came close to are table to ask about drinks or food for 15 minutes. Had to ask a runner to get a server. Then it was another five minutes before he showed. He acted like he was in a daze and was speaking in a monotone. Probably won't be back for awhile.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shane S.,"Washington, DC",6/20/2018,5.0,"I have traveled the world--Egypt, Spain, Palestine, Israel, Japan, including most major cities on the East Coast, in Midwest and in Southeast U.S. THIS IS THE BEST BURGER I'VE EATEN! First, there is a great bar with an extensive bourbon selection and a great local / craft beer selection. The fries cooked in duck fat are the best and the onion rings will make you keep reaching for more! I have eaten the bison and the beef burgers--both were cooked pefectly, very flavorful and a perfect consistency (not overworked). The buns are soft and a pefect compliment to the burger. If you are in Knoxville, this is a must-stop-spot. If you are driving through Knoxville, this is a must-stop-spot. If you haven't been, then you need to go!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kem K.,"Canton, MI",12/13/2019,3.0,"This place is packed with everyone having a good time. You will have to get there early to get a spot.Overall, burgers and sides are excellent but not worth waiting in line more than one hour for."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stacey K.,"La Grange, KY",6/26/2018,4.0,"Highly recommended as the burger place to try while in Knoxville, known for their locally grown gourmet craft burgers, we decided we needed to try this place.  With an initial wait of approximately 2 hours, we figured this must be well worth the wait.   So we just enjoyed some of the Market Square before we were called for our dinner.  They will text you when your table is ready, so you have the ability to roam around while waiting.Small relaxed atmosphere in the restaurant when we checked in, however, we chose to eat outside, where there were about 6 tables.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive, however, we got of to a shaky start when she accidentally spilled my husbands drink on her.   She took awhile to get something for him to wipe up the spill that went all over her lap, but soon realized she forgot he had sprite and not just water.  It was an accident understandably, but would have liked to see her act quicker to helping him dry off, and had to ask for a wet towel instead of dry since it was pop and sticky.  From there, the rest of the experience was wonderful.  So many burger choices, and unique as well!  We started with House Fried Pickles, and Spicy Crab dip.  Both very delicious!  I chose the Steakhouse  burger for myself, which included barrel aged cheddar, steak sauce, crispy onions, and mushrooms.  Very tasty burger, and good size.  I had to take some home!  We were allowed to half and half our side, so I ordered half portion of onion rings, and half portion of Duck Confit Fries.....heavenly!!  My step daughter ordered the Elvis...Organic peanut butter, fried banana's, and bacon on a burger.   Seemed like an odd combination to me, but she said it was actually extremely good.  All in all, I would recommend giving these burgers and sides a try.  Very worth the wait!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Emalee B.,"Puyallup, WA",12/14/2020,5.0,"Asked around where the best place to eat was. No hesitation I was told Stock & Barrel. Upon walking in, their sign read ""best burgers"". Needles to say they spoke the truth. Thank you BROOK for some great service. It's been awhile since we had someone so kind who knew what they were taking about. Definitely made this experience 10/10."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,J W.,"Charlotte, NC",10/1/2019,5.0,"We were visiting my family in Knoxville and asked them for the best place for a burger. So they recommended this place -- and they were right. Now, whenever we are visiting, we make it a point to come here. Every time we have been here, the burgers were cooked flawlessly exactly as requested. The onion rings have a little different taste (secret recipe?) that makes them especially addictive. The restaurant gets full early and once here, you will see why. This is definitely our go-to place when we're in town!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nick R.,"Nashville, TN",9/4/2018,4.0,"We came here around 6:30 on a Friday evening.  The wait is what you would expect a popular restaurant to be on a Friday night at the peak of dinner hour, approximately 45 minutes - hour.  The restaurant is quaint, but on the small side.  There is not much room to breathe when you get in and that also adds to the wait.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the farm burger with duck fries and they were amazing.  The bacon is smoked, however almost a little too much, and adds a very overwhelming flavor to the burger.  Because the bacon was oversmoked and the restaurant needs to be expanded I am giving it a 4 star.  Burger, ambiance, and whiskey selection are all 5 stars though."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Andre P.,"Fishers, IN",7/1/2019,5.0,First time here. Came with family while on vacation.  Nice little place that has both indoor and outdoor seating.  We each had a burger and onion rings.  The fries look amazing but couldn't get past the beer battered onion rings. The burger was very juicy and the buns were local bakery.  I highly recommend stopping in.  I know if we come back to Knoxville we will return.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1/21/2018,5.0,"Stock & Barrel is absolutley phenomenal. Located in Market Square, this place is such a solid spot for brunch and lunch. There's parking in the market square parking garage, which definitely helps get you closer to the restaurant when you're in need of a fix that only Stock and Barrel can stratch. True to its name, this place does two things and only two things. Burgers & Bourbon. And they do both incredibly well. Their list of burgers and bourbon is phenomenal. They're so unique, craft and innovative. The quality and freshness of their ingredients is awesome. You really can't go wrong with any item on their menu and they absolutely have something for everyone."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Max M.,"Riverside, CA",6/1/2021,5.0,I am not really a supporter of veggie burgers but I heard good things about S&B. The hype was true. They're dope. The veggie burger was legit but the fries? The fries stole the show. It was as close as I've ever felt to bring a gambling addict. I also got a shake - the Nutella one. Honestly it was waaaay better than it should've been. I strong-rec that ensemble to vegetarians.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Natalie W.,"Colonial Heights, VA",8/16/2018,5.0,Outstanding pimento cheese appetizer - so so so good! Elvis Burger and the 'Merican very tasty and HUGE!!! they let you 1/2 and 1/2 the rings and fries which is always a plus. So much food that we left an entire burger and fries if you put our two plates together- should have shared!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel L.,"Knoxville, TN",5/30/2021,5.0,Best burgers in town! One of our favorite places to eat and their milkshakes are delicious!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kierra T.,"Atlanta, GA",9/26/2020,5.0,Steakhouse Burger was soooooooo good! I added a fried egg on to mine and ordered the duck fat fries instead. The fries were some of the best I ever had. Food is VERY heavy so you'll be in for a nice nap afterwards
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tony D.,"Katy, TX",7/5/2019,1.0,"I don't leave reviews but I have never seen such rudeness and stupidity.  Patio was completely empty and we had 17 people for a sports team.  We simply asked if 1 table could be pushed together for a group of 6 players.  Hostess was very friendly and was working with us until some young loser (and non manager, I confirmed) came and said they don't do that.  He was extremely rude and condescending and said it was their ""policy"" - said they have 3 waitresses for a 12 ft by 12 for patio.  I asked for a manager and none was on duty again.  I asked if he really wanted to let 20 checks walk out the door and he didn't budge.  A non manager turned down that much business.  Really really stupid decision.  We will never be back.  Poor waitresses missed out on all that tip money because of a young, ignorant decision completely void of any business sense.  Food didn't look that good anyway."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,George S.,"Sinking Spring, PA",7/23/2018,4.0,"Stock & Barrel is a great beer & burger joint. It's in the trendy Market Square, a cool place to meet people and hang out with friends. The pimento cheese dip & fried green tomato appetizer are delicious starters....then pick a burger & upgrade the side of fries to the duck fries!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cory B.,"Knoxville, TN",5/27/2019,5.0,"Absolutely the best burger place that I have ever tried.  Previously I had tried the Bison burger, and it was amazing.  Today I tried the Ring of Fire, and it is the best Spicy burger that I have ever tried.  The fries and onion rings were amazing too.  Our server Chelsey was very friendly and did a great job taking care of us.  The food, service, and atmosphere are all great.  I highly recommend it!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sam D.,"Roswell, GA",11/23/2020,5.0,Very good food and service! Would recommend getting on the waitlist before you arrive if possible on busier nights!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie H.,"Washington, DC",11/21/2015,4.0,"Even though we came through town on a game day, we were actually able to find free parking on the street! We even stumbled on a Farmer's Market, which was delightful to walk through on our way to lunch. This place is certainly on the small side, so I can understand how it can fill up and have a long wait time. But the way it's laid out doesn't feel cramped - there's plenty of space between each table so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of the people next to you. My mom ordered a simple burger with cheese and bacon and enjoyed that. But she was even more excited about the duck fat fries! My mother is a thrifty woman (which rubbed off on me, too!) who thinks carefully about upgrading or paying extra. These duck fat fries were totally worth it!! They had great texture - some fries were soft and juicy and some smaller bits were crispy. They also tasted AWESOME when I dipped them in my garlic aioli (which came with my burger and I opted to get on the side - good decision! There was enough to dip my burger and the fries, too!!). I ordered a burger with pimento cheese and bacon. They really gave me a decent hunk of cheese on top!! The patty of cheese was just as thick as the hamburger patty!! It had a really nice mix of a sweetness and a slight kick of heat! The amount of cheese made the bacon quite unnoticeable - I don't think I tasted it at all. Next time I would either go without the bacon or order extra in hopes of actually tasting it. This place is definitely great and I would visit again next time I'm traveling through Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,George L.,"Knoxville, TN",8/13/2019,4.0,Burgers here are great I had one with onion rings and it was phenomenal. I wish they had more space if so would give 5! But every time I'm there food is excellent however I wait for almost an hour to get a seat so if you plan on coming here you should come before normal lunch or dinner hours or plan on waiting a bit to be seated because it is a small space they have but in a great location in market square.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bethany N.,"Powell, TN",11/22/2020,5.0,Great burgers and whiskey selection. Don't go in a hurry as there is usually a long wait- the food is worth it though.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Frank Q.,"Slingerlands, NY",4/4/2019,1.0,"This place is a joke.  It rates among the top in Knoxville, but they will not take reservations, are not friendly at the door, and when you show up at the door they tell you there is like an hour plus wait.  However, what is most ludacris is that you look in front of you and see like two tables completely empty, yet they don't take reservations??????  When you ask about the tables they say they ""are reserved"". Go figure.  Maybe it is because I am Cuban Hispanic.  Who knows these days.  This place is simply unable to manage the balance of service and accommodation, with their apparent high quality food, which I am yet to try on this business trip, because I have tried and been sent away twice thus far."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Wyatt E.,"Harrisonburg, VA",5/22/2021,5.0,On a Saturday around 5:30 the wait was 30 mins. We got the American and Farmhouse burgers. Each were enough to take leftovers.  Fried pickles for starters were great. Pet friendly our dog sat outside with us and enjoyed a bowl of water and a burger. The Black Betty was a good cocktail. Also enjoyed the street talent near by after dinner.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joshua K.,"Regina, Minneapolis, MN",8/7/2019,5.0,Here for the weekend and glad I stopped by. Great burger selection. The chicken waffle sandwich was massive but was very tasty. Small beer selection but was nice to have more local ones to try out.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sabina L.,"Detroit, MI",6/30/2018,5.0,"Just deal with the wait because the food is so worth it. I'm salivating as I write this and will be starving by the end. Usually they overestimate the wait, and by the time you finish your drink next door, they'll have texted or called you back over. Their duck confit fries are one of my favorite foods in the world (get extra aioli!). You can't go wrong with any of their burgers: bison, shroomin', Greek, big nasty, they're all amazing. My favorite drink has muddled strawberries, bourbon, basil, and lemonade in it - can't remember the name because they changed it. This place is worth the hype! The service is fantastic. The Market Square garage fills up sometimes, so have a backup plan for parking during events and weekends."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kay R.,"Knoxville, TN",10/18/2020,5.0,This place is perfectly situated in market square. They have the most amazing burgers and their not to small. Their milkshakes are very creamy and delicious. The staff is also very nice. The seating area is a pretty good size also.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike C.,"Lake Wylie, SC",9/1/2019,5.0,"Alright, all I can say is yum. From the duck fat fries, mac n cheese to my Ring of Fire burger, food was fantastic! I'll definitely be back when I'm in town. Next time, I'll have a drink!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christian S.,"Charlotte, NC",7/24/2019,5.0,"Stopped by this place for lunch today as I was staying at the Hilton downtown and this was just a short walk over to Market Square.  I chose here based on Yelp reviews and I will say the favorable reviews were well-deserved and spot on.  I ordered the Black and Blue burger with half fries and half onions rings and I can say I did not leave dissatisfied.  Burger was on point and onion rings were excellent.  Although the joint was very busy when I arrived, they had a small table inside for me which was perfect and the waitress was very attentive despite the heavy lunch crowd.  Their craft cocktails were not only interesting concoctions, they were quite tasty.  I hope to visit again on my next trip to Knoxville.  Check this place out."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lita L.,"Tampa, FL",2/9/2018,3.0,"We stopped here for a light late lunch about 2:30 so there was no wait, like some said there was at more prime times, with 2 burger enthusiasts among us. We shared the bison burger with fries fried in duck fat plus an order of onion rings. The bison burger was ordered medium rare, since it is naturally lean, but it was served on the well side of medium with pink barely detectable. It was just okay, and would have sent it back if we didn't have somewhere to go. We couldn't finish the fries, mainly because it was overly greasy and heavy, and we were sharing! I know homemade fries tend to be greasier than commercial frozen fries, but I wouldn't order it again. The onion rings were extra crispy and the atmosphere and service was good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mia L.,"Knoxville, TN",11/15/2020,5.0,Went here for the first time with out of town family. Everyone loved it. They had an elk burger on special that looked really good. They even let us do half fries and half onion rings. Can't wait to go back!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christian W.,"Folsom, CA",5/17/2021,3.0,"From the reviews on here we had to try out the #1 spot in Knoxville. Good spot to hangout, have a few drinks and a burger. We felt it was underwhelming on a Friday night"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,C Z.,"Raleigh, NC",7/5/2019,4.0,"Food is pretty good. My wife thinks they go a bit heavy on the liquid smoke but in subsequent visits we've asked and they're happy to tone it down a bit.  People in Knoxville will say it's the best burger in town. I don't share that opinion but it's definitely good. Tried the chicken and waffle burger/sandwich once, needs a fork in knife as it fell apart on me. Quarters are a little tight and metal chairs... woof.Wait staff has always been super pleasant. Definitely like the text message when there is a long wait so that you can dink around market square."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tony J.,"West Covina, CA",6/9/2018,5.0,Amazing selection of bourbon. Burgers are great! Make sure to get the duck fries are amazing. Taylor was the best server ever! Very accommodating to our party. Well visit again if I find myself in Knoxville
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Anna R.,"Spring Hill, TN",11/13/2020,4.0,"We are new to the Knoxville area and we saw the rating was great so we decided to try it! I got a burger and it was amazing, heard they were the best burgers in town. COVID-19 wise, they have a supper small restaurant so I can't imagine how hard it is to make it covid friendly, but they did a great job. I would say the restaurant was around 75% capacity. The staff was super friendly and kind. They were super busy so you could tell it was the Hot Spot. We got our food to go and it took a max 15 even with them being so busy. If your looking for the BEST burger in town, you've found the place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason K.,"SC, SC",10/9/2020,5.0,"Got the spicy crab dip, pimento cheese, two burgers and two kids dinners. All great quality, taste, and all very fresh. Quick service considering it's all made to order.  Worth the wait in case there's a long line!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Esther H.,"Ravenswood, WV",8/24/2019,5.0,"I go to a lot of well-hyped places that just don't live up to all the hype - this is NOT one of those. Great service. Friendly staff. A great selection of whisky. Really amazing burger, a yummy s'mores shake and the best onion rings I've ever had hands down! Check-in with Yelp was super easy and once we arrived we were seated immediately. Put this on your don't miss list for Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jd J.,"Murfreesboro, TN",11/8/2020,5.0,Great service good food. Reserve ahead workedPerfect.  I loved my Burger with Blueberry and the tomato salad was delicious as well.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,oralia l.,"Grand Blanc, MI",5/18/2018,5.0,"SOOO GOOD!Everything about the burgers were delicious! The beef had a great flavor, bun was soft but stood up to the juiciness of the burger and ...THE BACON! Their fries were so good, we went back before we left town!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christine H.,"Peachtree Corners, GA",9/6/2017,4.0,"We came after a recommendation from our friend in town. Even at 3pm, there was a wait so we sat at the bar. We ordered the Opa appetizer and Crispy Shrooms to start. The Opa appetizer was perfectly caramelized with the honey and is served with bread. For the shrooms, if you don't like horseradish, don't get it. The shrooms had a slight horseradish taste aside from the horseradish sauce (which I planned on just not using). For our entree, we ordered the bison burger that comes with the duck confit fries. The fries really hit the spot. It was full of flavor. The burger was pretty good. Overall, it was a great experience."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cory H.,"Lake Worth, FL",9/2/2020,5.0,"Probably the best chicken sandwich I've ever had (""The Mother Clucker""). The drinks were on point! Fried pickles were huge and full of flavor. To top it off, our server Georgia G was wonderful. I see why this place has so many good reviews."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Addy G.,"Queen Creek, AZ",3/1/2019,3.0,"I figured since I was in Tennessee, I had to take a walk in the local's shoes. Stock and Barell is advertised as a bourbon and burger bar. I like that my options were slim and direct. Right after work, we headed to Stock and Barrel for a bourbon and a burger. As my Yelp followers know, I don't often stray from my regular vodka martini if I'm going to have a cocktail. This place did not strike me as a martini place. Not without the locals laughing at me, anyways! We showed up and it was very busy, we were first told that there was a 45 minute wait, then the hostess came over and said it would only be 15 minutes. I gave her my phone number and got a text from the restaurant right away. They tried to seat us right by the door at this horrible table that should not have even been there. We said we didn't want that table and we ended up scoring seats at the bar anyway. The service was very slow at the bar, but we ended up talking to the bartender and having him recommend a good Tennessee whiskey. I went with a whiskey called The Fugitives. It was absolutely delicious and although I am not a bourbon drinker, I could tell this was a great option. I saw the bartenders lighting a lot of the shots on fire, too! I ordered the deadhead burger which is quinoa and black bean with avocado and garlic aoli on a honey wheat bun. I figured if I was going to do the burger thing, I could at least try a healthy option. They had a great range of burgers with all kinds of meat. Salmon, bison, lamb, beef, turkey, chicken, and vegetarian options. When it was finally time to pay the bill, it was very hard to get the attention of either bartender at this point. When I finally did, I realized that the small shot of bourbon I got was $16. Probably something he should've mentioned since all of the other drinks were very low priced. I never said anything and gave them a good tip anyway. Overall, this is a good spot if you're looking for something low-key, not fancy, and a good, Tennessee staple."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ken K.,"Annapolis, MD",4/6/2021,4.0,"Good atmosphere, good food, and an extensive whiskey list. Worth a visit for the burgers and duck fat fries!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Janelle S.,"Indianapolis, IN",10/1/2020,5.0,Great spot with thorough Covid precautions.  Drinks and food were excellent.  Great service providers!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christian R.,"Columbus, GA",5/4/2021,5.0,"We were in Knoxville for volleyball and ate at Stock & Barrel.  The menu is more or less limited to burgers, but they might be the best burgers you'll ever eat.  The place is small, but the staff is friendly.  I'd go back for sure."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cass G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/25/2020,5.0,The burger was amazing and they have so many to choose from. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable .  Great atmosphere!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Copper W.,"Farragut, TN",10/29/2020,5.0,The best food and alcohol and ambiance. I love that you have a choice of meat choices for your hamburger
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amber B.,"Charlotte, NC",8/10/2020,3.0,Mmmmhe...Mediocre at best. Turkey burger was lackluster. Strong drinks though! I probably would not go back for food (but maybe for drinks).
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Derrick C.,"Dallas, TX",11/28/2017,4.0,"My co worker and I stopped by mid afternoon after landing in Knoxville around 2 pm, based off of location to our hotel and good reviews. We were both starving and wanted a good meal.In the end, we probably ate and ordered too much food. The entire menu looked delicious. I had decided to eat a bison burger, so I made sure to do that, but customized it a bit with bacon, garlic aioli. I ordered it medium rare and it came out just as I ordered. I did specifically ask for mac and cheese instead of fries as my side, and the order was brought out with fries instead of mac and cheese. Also, I specifically asked for the burger without the tomato jam, but the burger included tomato jam anyway, which I didn't make a fuss about and just ate it as-is.The food and presentation was on par. The inside space is small but the setup was perfect. It accentuated that we were in a great college town. I also ordered the spicy crab dip. My co worker decided not to have any, so for just one person it's way too much and far too heavy. I wish I hadn't eaten so much of it by myself. It was good but not amazing. Very thick and heavy with cream.Overall we were both very impressed and made a right choice. Had my order been correct the first time, I would have considered a 5 star rating."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael G.,"Charlotte, NC",4/25/2021,5.0,"This place is the real deal. We had duck fries for an app which were so tasty but the burger was off the charts. I highly recommend "" The Bernie."" The blueberry preserve combo with the blue cheese was delightful. My wife likes her burger well done and she said it still packed a ton of flavor and perfectly seasoned. Awesome experience."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Scott M.,"Westerville, OH",6/19/2018,4.0,"Stock & Barrel is a great burger joint with an excellent Bourbon selection.Recent trip to Knoxville gave me the opportunity to stop in at Stock & Barrel.  Their online menu intrigued me for a while now.  The space is a bit small, reclaimed urban space.  Seating outside on a small patio and along one of the interior walls.  A long bar dominates the opposite wall.  Miraculously, we arrived early enough to nab indoor seating.  Our server was quick, attentive, and able to explain the menu to us.  She was able to handle substitutions with ease.  The Beer menu is chock full of local options, but the bourbon and whiskey list is encyclopedic.  I sadly didn't have any, but i was eyeing the Weller 12 year.I got the Hurt Locker.  It was southern comfort food on a burger.  Pimento Cheese, Benton's bacon, a fried green tomato and bourbon onions.  It was fantastic.  A side option is half fries and half onion rings.  Please more places adopt this option, so i can never have to make a decision again.  Great service, great food, great bourbon list.  Tiny seating space."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vanessa C.,"Nampa, ID",10/25/2017,3.0,"Trendy little place on Market Square with good food. It was really yummy but I think we made a few missteps in what we ordered. For an appetizer we got fried mushrooms, which had a yummy horseradish sauce, but were really heavy. The fried pickles looked a lot better. I got the Hurt Locker (pimento cheese and bacon) and it was really yummy but my husband got the Bernie and all you could taste was the blue cheese. The duck fries were very good but the sauce it came with was also ALL blue cheese. The other issue we had was we ordered or burgers medium rare but there were parts that were uncooked. The atmosphere is nice, we sat out on the patio. My server was nice but once he found out that we weren't ordering alcohol, as always happens, it seems like he ignored us. Or maybe it's because were outside, who knows. But my water only got filled once and we waited for 10 minutes with empty plates for him to bring us a check, then another 10 for him to get our card and pay. I'm giving it a 3 for that but I think if we had ordered better things it would have been a 4."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Natalie G.,"Milton, FL",7/5/2020,5.0,"Great food! Had the OPA! Seared crispy feta and honey on toasted baguette and the Hurt Locker burger, pimento cheese, friend green tomato, bacon and whiskey onions. The best onion rings I think I've had anywhere. Also had the black Betty cocktail which was tart and good. Kids had burgers and Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was a slight bit spicy, not like a bland kraft, but my kid really liked it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike S.,"Fairfax County, VA",5/10/2018,5.0,"Walked in at 8pm on a Thursday night, and was told the wait would be 30 minutes. Fortunately there were a few seats at the bar, which is full service--score!First, the bourbon list is bomb. Prices are reasonable, with excellent variety. I had a Willet Rye for $10. 5 stars for the whiskey.Beer list--solid beers, but only half a dozen on tap. Lots of excellent Michigan beers on tap (Bells, Founders) plus KY Bourbon Barrel Ale, which is awesome. 3 stars for selection, 4 stars for quality.Service was excellent and friendly, food came very quickly. 5 stars.Burger was great. I got The Billy, my brother-in-law got the one with pimiento cheese. Both were awesome, and very reasonably priced at $12.50. Above average fries, too. 4 1/2 stars.Would I go again? Heck yes."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Glenn R.,"Palm Beach, FL",8/15/2020,5.0,"Just an incredible find.We were on a road trip and Knoxville was our lunch destination, but we had never been there before. We decided to look for a place off the interstate and in the downtown area. After checking the Yelp reviews I picked this restaurant. Wow, did we get lucky.The bartender was great and we sat at the bar. My gf ordered the Bernie which is their #1 seller. I will let you look it up on the menu, but just fabulous. I ordered the Hurt Locker, which is their #2 seller. We are in our 60's and we both agree that these burgers were the best that we ever had!! Did I mention that you can sub onion rings for fries at no extra charge?We are now thinking about a future  3 day road trip and staying a block away from the restaurant. How is that for happy.We highly recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,De'Jia S.,"Market Square, Knoxville, TN",12/6/2020,1.0,"The burgers are amazing! I always get the salmon burger.. however I recently went to dine in with my fiancée and I must say the front house does not match the back.. We were ignored for several minutes, with no acknowledgment mind you we are standing in-front of  the host at the host stand..until another couple came in behind us  which they greeted them immediately and offered them a table.. the (white) Couple had to tell them we were here first and turn down the table because they were just as confused as us.. finally we were acknowledged and offered a 30 minute wait.. wow.. As if being the only black people there at a time like this isn't awkward enough.. Definitely not a pro Black establishment.. I'd advise take out.."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Donald P.,"Oakley, CA",4/17/2021,2.0,"I went to Stock and Barrel with my wife and daughter. The main reason we went here was for the Bourdon and the beer. I asked our server Lexie what type of beer they had on tap, she said that they only had can beers. I then ordered  a can then noticed that they did have tap beers. I then asked if I could see the allocated bourdon list and she gave the regular bourdon list. I again asked her for the allocated bourdon list and she stated that they did not have one. When I told her that I saw it on their website she rudely stated that the website has not been updated. Before we were even done eating she gave us the bill and it seemed she was trying to rush us out because  were busy. The food was just ok and the burgers were dry. Save your money and go somewhere else."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",5/22/2015,4.0,"I came to Stock & Barrel with a friend who was visiting in town and since we just finished watching the Symphony concert, this was a place I needed to review, and since it was right around the corner it made sense. So going around 9:30 PM, on a weekday, the crowd is pretty much thinned out. I had to get the bartender's attention and was told that she had to go check the kitchen to see if the kitchen itself was still opened. Luckily, they were and we came just in time.For Apps, we started off with some fried mushrooms. It came with this creamed horseradish as a dip. It was definitely interesting. The only problem with this is that when you cook mushrooms, water comes out. So, when they fry it, there's still juice that comes out along with the breading that they have with the mushrooms. It's not bad, I thought it was pretty good. Another favorite from others are the Duck Confit Fries, but I'm on a low carb sort of diet now, and I knew that the burger would cover my bases. Also, if you don't want to get that as an app, you can substitute your fries for it for I believe $2-3 more.Their menu was pretty extensive and they had multiple burgers. I was in for a little more meaty-type of burger so I ordered the Steakhouse Burger with a side of onion rings. On the burger, it came with your patty, fried onions, and mushrooms. The fried onions isn't like your fried onion rings, it's more like pre-made fried onions you can get at Costco from a bag.  That was  the only one ingredient was a prepared type of thing, however the rest wasn't too bad. One thing that caught me off guard was that the bun itself had Worcester sauce on it, which makes sense with the ""Steakhouse"" burger. I liked how they had that extra touch with the Worcester sauce.Other than that, they had a pretty good beer menu and an extensive liquor menu. I'll be sure I'm going to be back here if I'm in the area and craving for a burger. I would suggest if you're in the mood for a burger, then check this place out!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paisley T.,"Seattle, WA",5/12/2017,3.0,Overrated. The burgers are very good for bistro style burgers. But they are not out of this world. The confit fries are disgusting. Waaaay too much. They are so greasy and soaking wet and soggy. Get the regular fries instead. The service is super slow. This is a safe bet after a day of shopping at market square. And they have tons of whiskey options.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Denise M.,"Columbus, OH",7/1/2019,4.0,"Sampled the Steakhouse, Shrooms, & the Hurtlocker. All 3 delivered as promised! The fresh buns were worth the carbload although they couldn't hold together the Hurtlocker. Fork & knife to the rescue! The pimento cheese sauce was among the best I've had from AR to SC or NOLA. But, the bite with the fried green tomato was worth the entire experience. Pure heaven & on next visit I would want just those 2 flavors to savor only- nothing else for my whole meal. Finally...the only thing keeping five stars were the duck fat fries. They were very good but not worth the up charge for accompanying the burger as a side compared to the onion ring option. The onion rings were perfect- not greasy, not too breaded & the onion stayed put in every bite. The Nutella shake was good but my expert consultant (15 yr old daughter who eats Nutella like crack) says Steak n Shake does it just as well."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John K.,"Stafford, VA",10/13/2020,5.0,I'm so glad this bar is still able to operate during COVID! Driving through Knoxville and stopped at Stock & Barrel for a bite to eat. What a pleasant surprise. They offer a great atmosphere with gourmet craft burgers using locally grown products. Also offer a wide range of bourbon to choose from. They also have craft beer for you beer lovers.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sheila N.,"Brevard, NC",9/11/2020,5.0,"oh my what a ""buger"" ...ghee, ""fantabulous""guy needs to drive his car here & try one...rachael fantastic waitress!!!! thanks"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Da Bears 1.,"Hendersonville, TN",1/25/2019,2.0,"You can't choose half stars, but this would be 2.5 stars.  The Market Square area where Stock & Barrel is located is nice.  The free parking garage next door is a bonus (free in the evenings and weekends). Now to the restaurant. This is almost exclusively a burger/pub place.  Your bill is paying for the setting as much as anything else.  There were three of us.  We tried their fried green tomatoes for an appetizer.  We all ordered a burger.  For drinks we had one Dr. Pepper and two waters.  Our bill before tip was just over $48 - a bit on the high side.  The fried green tomatoes cost $8 and we got four.  They were okay, but definitely not worth $8.  If you go to The Loveless Cafe in Nashville you can order their fried green tomatoes for $3 and they taste a lot better.They take pride in their hand-cut fries, but they have the same problem as Five Guys - limp fries without much flavor.  They weren't bad, but it's just limp pieces of potatoes.  They give you a lot, but again were average at best. The burgers were okay, but there's a lot of other places I'd rather get a burger from.  They have a lot of trendy burgers.  My son ordered one with a fried egg on it.  If you want one with peanut butter and bananas, or other non-traditional toppings, then I guess this is a place you'd like.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  I didn't like that they used ""greens"" instead of iceberg lettuce.  I pulled enough romaine/greens off to almost make a small side salad. My burger had sauteed onions, which had a strong, sort of sour taste that was too dominate.  The bacon was thick and chewy (no crunch - not ideal for burgers).  This bacon would be better as a side for breakfast.  When taking a bite, the entire slice of bacon wanted to come out.  I don't know if it was grease, or something the onions were sauteed in, but underneath my bun there was so much ""juice"" that most of my bottom bun was soggy.   I know it sounds like my burger was a mess and not very good.  Once I pulled off most of the ""lettuce"" and some of the onions it was fine.  Again, there are lots of other burger places I'd rather eat at.  If you're a drinker (I'm not), then maybe you'd like to go here.  And I suppose if you get enough alcohol in you, you'd be okay with paying more for an average, ""fancy"" burger.This place kind of reminds me of Bar Taco in Nashville.  Both are in nice areas, are higher priced for basic food items, are trendy, and have a heavy emphasis on their alcohol.  I'm more likely to go back to Bar Taco than Stock & Barrel. Service was pretty good.  No issues to make mention of. Lunch was great, not because of the meal, but because we were visiting our son.  Having lunch with my family is always good.  But for those of you looking to find out about a restaurant I'd say try it if you are looking for a burger adventure.  If you're really into french fries, you'll want to go elsewhere.  If you're looking for the best burger you've ever eaten, I doubt you'll find it here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amber S.,"Nashville, TN",1/27/2020,4.0,"Food was good and our server was really great. Love that they let you get 1/2  onion rings and 1/2  fries. Only downside was the wait. We were driving in to town and got on a  wait list 45 minutes ahead of time. When we checked in  we were  quoted another 20-30 minutes. 45 minutes later we were ""next to be sat"". A very small location so be prepared to wait and don't take the quoted time at face value."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert K.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2020,3.0,"When we as a party 5 arrived at 5:17 pm on a Sunday, we were told a 30-45 min wait. Very acceptable for a small place with limited seating. An hour and a half later we are still sitting at the bar waiting for a table. You seated a party of 8 that arrived after us because you have only one 8 top. You seated multiple parties of 4 who arrived after us because you refuse to rearrange tables. After an hour and forty minutes we gave up and ordered at the bar. Your communication with your customers is unacceptable. Your seat management is atrocious.  Your product is amazing so customer service isn't really necessary. For the official report. We arrived at 5:17 and as of 6:50 we have not received dinner. The wait goes on......"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lauren H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/14/2020,4.0,"5 stars for food, 3 stars for service. Came here at the time they opened, on a weekday for the first time. Trying to get in the door was super awkward. There was only one couple in front of us waiting to be seated and no one else inside yet, so I'm not sure what took so long. Then the girl serving the outside patio kept having to walk through our group to get out, it was just kind of a mess with kids. Server was great, just slow. It took forever to pay and with 2 antsy kids it was a little stressful. I got the black & bleu burger and fries, and it was delicious! The peppered bacon was amazing. If you're looking for a burger joint, this is your place! Will definitely give it another shot."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christopher F.,"Fort Wayne, IN",5/4/2018,5.0,"OMG this place is great! Best burger I have had in years. Had the hurt locker: pimento cheese, bourbon onions, bacon. IncredibleBourbon list is extensive and awesome! Highly recommended!."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kim R.,"Madison, AL",7/28/2019,5.0,Stopped on our way home from vacation in OBX.  Well worth the detour into town!  Amazing selection of Bourbon and the food is amazing!!  I had the Hurtlocker and my SO had the Steakhouse- both were delish!! Definitely recommend!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Holly E.,"Wildwood, MO",7/4/2019,2.0,"Food was just ok. Our waitress seemed like she'd rather be anywhere but there, we felt rushed and had to ask for refills each time. The actual location is super cute with a really cool environment. The environment made the experience but the food wasn't worth the $20/person bill by no means."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sabrina P.,"Georgetown, KY",2/11/2019,4.0,"The burger was fantastic.   The fries and onion rings were cold.  We were instantly given water but never asked if we wanted an actual drink.   My fiance tried to get out of the server what beers were local and she replied all of them.  Although I'm certain Sweetwater is from Atlanta and Lagunitas is from Chicago.   He order a BlackBerry Farm Saison and we never received it.  The server barely checked on us.  The tables around us had a mysterious plate of dipping sauce for their fries this was never mentioned to us.  Great burger, not so great service.   Not very friendly from start to finish."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jerry V.,"Walland, TN",5/2/2019,5.0,"I enjoyed this place. The outdoor seating was great, overlooking market square on a beautiful evening. Excellent choice of beers, along with an extensive list of harder stuff. The fried pickles were delicious and plentiful. The burgers were awesome! Incredible flavor and cooked the way they were ordered. The accompanying fries were hand cut and delicious. When in Knoxville, this place is a must."

I drink ice water husband had a Stella Artois it's a small restaurant but it was the food was good and I am thoroughly enjoyed my Mother's Day
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stacia M.,"Austell, GA",3/4/2019,5.0,Checked out all the reviews before jumping off of the highway and this was definitely a great move. You get so much burger for your money that I have dinner for tonight. Then the taste - OMG! I had the Hurt Locker Burger and Duck Confit Fries.

This was absolutely the best burger I have eaten in my life (and I am 50 years old).  We arrived at noon.  No wait.  Sat outside to people watch.  The service was fantastic.  They have a HUGE selection of bourbon but I opted for a craft beer."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany B.,"Augusta, GA",12/4/2018,4.0,We came here pretty late one night and were glad that they did not have a wait. There was a group of about eight of us. Most of us were just having drinks but some ordered some food. I tried the crab dip and that is easily up there for some of the best crab dip I have ever had. I tried a friend's duck confit fries and also thought those were delicious. I tried the s'mores shake that someone else ordered and it was tasty. Would have liked to come back here to try the Nutella one but will add it to my list to come back to when I am in town!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Caleb C.,"Hudson, NC",10/1/2019,4.0,Great place to go and enjoy a game or hang out with friends. Burgers are great and their duck fat fries are delicious!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,George D.,"York, SC",2/27/2015,5.0,"This is hands down the best burger I have ever had.  It was called the Bernie.  It should be called the ""Incredible K-Ahhhs""!  It had blue cheese crumbles, fried jalapenos, bacon and get this... blueberry jam.  This chaotic combination of ingredients was... was... actually, I cannot come up with the words to describe how good this burger tasted.  And then...there were the ""Duck Fries"".  The only thing I can add to what has already been said about these fries is that you would likely kill another human being to get to these fries.  They are 'that' good. If YELP had 6 stars, I would give them that.I do have to say, I felt bad for one particular waitress.  She just looked like she had the weight of the world on her shoulders.  The whole time we were there, I did not see her smile once.  She looked just like Mila Kunis too.  If I was a woman and I looked like Mila Kunis, I would smile all the time!  ;-)"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Charity R.,"Lexington, SC",9/27/2019,5.0,"Such a wide range of burger options! It's crazy, you've got to try this place when in Knoxville. If you are GF or DF they accommodate so willingly!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,J W.,"Charlotte, NC",10/1/2019,5.0,"We were visiting my family in Knoxville and asked them for the best place for a burger. So they recommended this place -- and they were right. Now, whenever we are visiting, we make it a point to come here. Every time we have been here, the burgers were cooked flawlessly exactly as requested. The onion rings have a little different taste (secret recipe?) that makes them especially addictive. The restaurant gets full early and once here, you will see why. This is definitely our go-to place when we're in town!"

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessie P.,"North Charleston, SC",9/15/2019,5.0,"So good! The service was truly phenomenal, Molly was just the sweetest! Weirdly enough, the burger buns were my favorite part. They are very thick and don't get soggy."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tyler C.,"Winfield, MO",9/10/2019,5.0,"We were coming in from a long drive with two tired, cranky kids and decided to get takeout. Stock & Barrel did not disappoint. The burger and macaroni were delicious, and the best part, after 20 minutes, the fries were still super crispy!! Stressed out, hangry parents dream!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jasmine N.,"Memphis, TN",9/9/2019,5.0,"I've been to plenty of burger places in Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville and I can say with full confidence that Stock and Barrel has the best burgers in all of Tennessee. The farmhouse burger ($12) is my forever go-to burger here. The egg is so perfectly cooked with just the right amount of yolk running on the sides. That bacon is incredibly delicious - thick cut that truly makes the burger come together. The onion rings were super crispy and fried with perfection. This came with the meal. The bison burger ($16) is a lot of people's favorites I know. The meat in both of the burgers was so tender and juicy. The duck fries were included with this meal! That creamy cheese in the bison burger made it all come together. Even if you don't get the bison burger ALWAYS upgrade to duck fries with any burger purchase - I want to say it's an additional $4 charge but 10000% worth it. The fries were cooked in duck fat with cheese and green onion garnished on it served in a bucket. best fries I've ever tasted in my life. Towards the bottom of the bucket is where you really taste the duck fat and man it is delicious. My friend and I came on a Saturday at noon and was seated in 30 min outside. such a wonderful vibe with a view of the farmers market happening. I've been here for lunch and dinner multiple times and have always waited at least 15 min for a table everytime no matter how many people eat. it's a pretty small restaurant in the first place but 100% worth the wait!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Johnny K.,"Dayton, OH",9/9/2019,5.0,"My favorite burger, by far, up till now, has been the Primetime burger from Hopdoddy. It is a deliciously decadent and sublime burger!But now, there is a clear contender for title of Best Burger (Ever) (in the Universe).  And it goes by the name of ""The Hurt Locker"" burger at the Stock & Barrel. And what a sublime and majestic burger this is!! The meat is every bit as delicious and velvety as the grass-fed Kobe meat on the Primetime.The pimento cheese atop The Hurt Locker is almost like a whipped frothy cheese, melty and delicious and oozing off the top of the burger!The fried green tomato is a sublime addition! As are the caramelized bourbon onions. And the bacon on the burger is excellent!!Highly HIGHLY recommended!!!(And the fries were excellent too!!)"

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Deirdre A.,"Durham, NC",9/2/2019,5.0,Great food and great bartenders! We had the 'Shroomin Burger and The Mother Clucker (fried chicken sandwich).

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Benjamin J.,"San Francisco, CA",2/2/2019,5.0,"Brittany...Brittney...Britknee? Not sure on spelling, but she is a fantastic bartender.The duck fat fries are a MUST, however, be warned as they are not as crisp as the regular fries (which yes, I also got, and yes, are also a MUST).I got the Hurt Locker, however, with the fried chicken in lieu of beef, and added the fried jalapeño on top... Brit and I named it the ""B-twice"". Order it, you won't be disappointed.My only quip...the salad (carburetor) was pretty lame. However, it came with a monstrous beef patty which was as good as they come and overshadowed the ""bleh"" greens underneath. Oh well, it's a burger joint, not a rabbit farm: still a 5-star place."

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rocco V.,"Peachtree City, GA",6/26/2019,2.0,Based on the reviews I was expecting a great burger experience.  Burger was over cooked and NO flavor.  Fries were limp-- not crispyOnion rings - oilyTomato salad - Would have expected a fresh burst of summer flavor but overpowered by the oil dressing. Overall not much flavor to the meal. Would not return.   Bummer.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chaker F.,"Gainesville, FL",3/17/2017,5.0,"I don't often make statements like this but Stock & Barrel makes some of the best burgers I've ever had. Period.I have visited Knoxville three time and Stock & Barrel has been a priority all three of those times. As soon as you look at the menu, you'll understand where the name comes from. Stock & Barrel has a plethora of bourbons and whiskeys available to customers. Beyond the alcohol, the real winner is the burgers. My favorite burgers are:1. The Bison burger- Crimini, Shiitake, Button Mushrooms, Boursin Cheese, Crispy Onions, Garlic Aioli, served with Duck Confit Fries.2. The Hurt Locker-  Pimiento Cheese, Benton's Bacon, Fried Green Tomatoes, Bourbon Onion.3. The Farmhouse- Barrel Aged Cheddar, Fried Egg, Benton's Bacon, Tomatoes, Onion, Garlic Aioli.All burgers come with a side but I highly recommend trying the Duck Confit Fries. #SoGood If you are in the area, I highly recommend stopping here. it will take your opinion of burgers to a whole new level."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Taylor C.,"Kingston Springs, TN",1/27/2021,4.0,"delicious food, i got a cheeseburger. It was a longgggg wait to be seated but it seemed like they got our food out pretty quickly despite being busy."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tyler J.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",6/9/2020,4.0,"Stopped in here for lunch on a Monday morning. They were almost at capacity which is great. The ambiance was nice and I imagine much nicer when it's dark outside so you can appreciate the lighting more. The food was amazing. I mean their flavor profiles on their burgers were some of the best I've had in a while. The duck fat fries went so fast at the table, we could have ordered two rounds.. They seemed just a bit pricey but the portion sizes were healthy. The burgers were so tall though, I almost couldn't fit it in my mouth. I attempted to order ""The Dude"" drink but the waitress came back about 8 minutes later to say they were missing an ingredient (although she didn't know which one). Our waitress didn't seem very knowledgeable, especially about their drinks. She went back and forth probably 6 times to ask the bartender questions. It would have been faster for the bartender to come out. I think if the staff beefed up their knowledge and speed, they'll be on their way to a top notch spot."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Catherine M.,"Lenexa, KS",1/21/2021,5.0,"We had an overnight stay in Knoxville on the way to South Carolina, and my bosses recommended this place. The food was great (they let me sub chicken on any burger, and I'm still dreaming about the fried green tomatoes.), but the stand-out for me was their bourbon selection and drinks. The Twins Basil cured my travel-and-holiday grumpies in two shakes."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nathan M.,"Spokane, WA",7/11/2017,5.0,"Delicious!  Nothing else to say...just kidding! I had the Greek burger, cooked to perfection, just the right amount of taziki sauce.  But honestly my favorite part of the meal was the tomato salad and turkey fries!  Worth the meal with just two things alone!  Only problem is now I will crave them and I only live 2000 miles away!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Danyell S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/22/2019,5.0,They have AMAZING burgers!!! They are yummy!!! There is always enough fro have it for lunch and dinner. The wait is always worth it!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chris R.,"Batavia, IL",1/12/2021,5.0,"This was such a great place. We sat at the bar and the bartender could not have been more knowledgeable or helpful with the menu. There are so many great choices. We each had a different burger, and both were fantastic and so dramatically different from one another, with so many great flavors. Plus, good fries, good salad and an overall great vibe and atmosphere."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Will H.,"Nashville, TN",10/5/2016,4.0,"We were on our way back to Nashville from the Pigeon Forge area and didn't want to eat along the tourist strip. We waited about 30 minutes and found this place here in Knoxville. The ratings and pictures looked good, so we tried it. The restaurant is located in the downtown area. We stopped in on a Sunday and were able to park for free in the very large parking garage next to the building that Stock and Barrel was in. There was also a farmers market going on in the common area in front, music and some kind of international festival too. For all the people that were in the area and trying to find a parking spot in the garage, the place wasn't too busy. They have a small patio area, which was almost full. I noticed the metal chairs looked a little rusty on some spots, so we picked to sit inside. It's in a row house, so there is a long bar on one side and seating on the other. It took a little while for our server to come take our drink order. He said there was a mixup. Two female employees stood a the end of the bar throughout our meal. I ordered the Shroomin' burger ($11.50), crimini, shiitake, button mushrooms, Swiss cheese, creamed horseradish. Phillip got The Hurt Locker ($12) pimento cheese, Benton's bacon, fried green tomatoes, bourbon onion. Both came with fries. They've got a duck fat fry app that we thought about getting, but we thought that might be too much fries. It would be a nice option to add like 3 bucks more to the order and the fries that come with your burger be the duck fat fries.I loved my burger, the mushrooms were cooked well and the meat of the burger had great flavor. I tried the pimento cheese on the hurt locker sandwich and it was great, however it can be a heavy burger with all the different toppings. The fries were a lot of little fries, I ate them with a fork to speed up the process. I enjoyed the meal and would come back again if I was ever in the area."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Laurie B.,"Market Square, Knoxville, TN",2/12/2021,1.0,We waited for over 10 minutes for a waiter and no one ever came so we got up and left.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Erika R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/18/2017,5.0,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? For at least two weeks now, I've been craving the Stock & Barrel salmon burger. I love it. Ignoring the fact that finding a salmon burger in this part of the country isn't an easy feat (correct me if I'm wrong, but is this the only salmon burger in Knoxville???), but a freshly-made with just the right amount of spices and capers and an avocado press, all on a bun that doesn't suck?! Amazing! Added bonus: leave with your omega-3 quota fulfilled for the week. Fries were hot and tasty. Had a bite of Big Daddy's classic bacon burger and black bean corn salad - both five star, also. Milkshakes looked incredible but we didn't have room - next time!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Charles S.,"Philadelphia, PA",3/10/2020,5.0,"Wow. Stopped in here for linch and the burger selection is top notch!

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vince B.,"Rockford, MI",7/18/2017,5.0,"Heck yea 5 stars!! My Yelper friends you nailed it The place has cool ambiance to it, wood, iron, and some fun art but to ""hipster"" so you got two tvs with some sports on and killer music...Doors, Avett etc...Best part of the visit though was the Bernie Burger I had. HOMERUN! The beef is fresh of the farm perfectly cooked medium rare, and flavor was thru the roof. Must try. Great drink selection and to cap it off every waiter and waitress was super star niceWill be back when I'm in town!!Must visit"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Corey C.,"Birmingham, AL",2/11/2019,4.0,"Had the Elvis burger tonight. Fried bananas, peanut butter, and bacon on a burger.

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael T.,"Knoxville, TN",2/28/2020,5.0,"Great burger with locally raised meat. I've only ever gotten take-out, but it's always hopping inside and has a great atmosphere."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert D.,"Parker, CO",9/22/2018,5.0,"Knoxville has been jumping on the trendy hipster bandwagon for some time now and S&B fits the bill nicely with a generous array of whiskeys from everywhere and a burger menu that touts locally raised farm to table ingredients.My entourage arrived ready to sample all of the above so we cozied up to a corner of the bar and perused the bourbons.  The staff are friendly and patient as they help you navigate the array and they were super cool in allowing us to see the bottles of those that we chose.  It was wise of us to order a stomach liner as some of our whiskeys were hot, so we paired the first few with their famous duck fat fries that come adorned with melted cheese and scallions.  Within the vast world of fries, whether you call them Pomme Frites or Freedom Fries, every town has restaurants claiming to offer the ""best in town"" etc etc..... but after a few of these I could only think: ""what kind of witchcraft are in these things?""  Highly addictive and bursting with potatoey goodness...... these are the real deal my friends.... I could not shove them in my face fast enough.  And thusly.... we sipped.... and we laughed and we sipped some more, until food became the priority to sop up some of the alcoholic barrage or at least slow it down.Shown in the picture is the Farm House burger resting on a lettuce bun, topped with thick cut bacon and an egg.  Of course more duck fat fries to complete the perfection.  The quality of ingredients scintillates as the meat delivers a deep and almost gamey richness that, together with the salty bacon and the yolky egg, is simply hamburger heaven.  This offering lingers at the top of my list of ""best burgers, US"" for sure.  It truly is the stuff of dreams I tell ya.Go here my friends and stay..... sip..... gorge your sloppy face with greasy duck fatty greatness!!!!Knoxville.... yay for you!!!!Robbo, Parker, CO"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",11/18/2014,4.0,"Crispy shrooms - a tad oily but what do you expect? It's deep fried! It's deep fried..who doesn't love deep fried veggies? Well there are times when the flour layer isn't crunchy, luckily this wasn't the case. The sauce that accompanied these deep fried button mushroom made this dish good. The deadhead veggie burger - amazing! Finally a real veggie burger that isn't rice based or a heated boca burger. If I wanted a grilled boca burger, I can grill it myself. So what is so great about this burger? The avocado, the garlic sauce, the texture of the burger and the toasted buns. This is NYC style fresh veggie burgers! Black bean hummus - could be better. By better I mean, hummus and pita not cold. I'm assuming the hummus was prepackaged and in the fridge and the pita was straight from the pack and cut. Baking it or toasting it would have been nice. Side note: ask for the fries to be separated from the burger because it will get soggy unless you prefer soggy fries. Overall, I loved their veggie burger and if you're craving deep fried mushrooms, hit this joint up!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kenny K.,"Rochester, MI",12/22/2019,5.0,"Finally was able to get in to this place, it's small so the always busy, especially on weekends! Burgers are delicious, can't go wrong . The fries are great as well. Had the crab dip, for my daughters sake, it was ok, growing up I was always told seafood and cheese don't go together, after trying this I still agree! Service was great!"

Burgers are my passion, along with Reese Cups!!!  I had the Bacon and Bleu burger with onion rings. Fantastic, it came with a Buttermilk Bleu Cheese Fondue, bacon, and onion straws!!! Of course i add ranch dressing and bbq sauce. Yummmmmmmmm!!!!!! Carnivore happy!!! Onion Rings were great, beer battered, almost reminded me of a tempura batter. Light and crunchy!!!! Familia loved theirs also, dad had a tomato, cucumber salad. He loved it, and the presentation was first rate. I can tell he really enjoyed it, he wasn't talking too much. Great place!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Annette P.,"Sylva, NC",12/4/2019,5.0,"Great burgers, great service. Loved visiting the area.  Got a little side show, the bartender obviously had no panties on under her leggings and she climbed up to her a bottle off the shelf!  Not exactly ""kid friendly"""
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cynda M.,"Cleveland, TN",6/1/2019,5.0,This was the BEST BURGER EVER!  Don't get me wrong I know my burgers and this place has it right. I have a gluten issue and they made sure I understood were or if any hidden or cross contamination could be. The burger was cooked just as I ordered and the service was great. Just know the wait was like an hour but we checked in and walked around the square and they text . It went by fast. Tip* pay the up charge and get the reg fries switched for the Duck fries. You will not be disappointed.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gigi C.,"Narberth, PA",1/16/2021,4.0,"This place has amazing burgers - especially the Bernie:  Blue Cheese Crumbles + Benton's Bacon + Blueberry Preserve + Beer Battered Jalapeños - - YES!!!!  The Mother Clucker also good:  Buttermilk Fried Chicken + Havarti + Garlic Aioli + Bourbon Onions + Tomato + Greens.  It just needed to be hotter, but we did pick-up, so we'll give them a pass.  And don't skip on the duck fat fries.  The girls at the door were adorable and very helpful.  FYI,  they don't receive tips.  I know, they get paid more hourly, but they were working their asses off - wait staff at the door.   Pay them cash directly.  I heard the bar tenders get the tips - even for takeout."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sebastian B.,"Port Monmouth, NJ",7/9/2014,4.0,"I coined a new phrase for my Hurt Locker burger. ""DELISH A RIFIC"" absolutely fabulous and the Duck Confit fries were stellar. The joint is cool, fabulous staff great tunes atmosphere is welcoming and relaxed. Here's a fabulist burger dive bar. They 5th star was lost on the fact that the burger was well done and I asked for medium rare but it was still very juicy and good to the last bite!They live up to the Best Burger in Knoxville title."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brandon P.,"Maryville, TN",7/18/2019,4.0,Service can be okay and sometime service can be s***** here. now that we have that out of the way as a food recommendation definitely try the duck fries! Duck fries duck fries duck fries duck fries more duck fries some water a fricking beer fries duck fries  duck fries duck fries. Hopefully pick up what I'm laying down and as soon as they're open you go try some of those duck fries! You know exactly what I mean once they hit your mouth!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tracie R.,"Monroe, NC",3/12/2020,5.0,Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. Highly suggest the white cheddar pimento cheese appetizer. The place was super busy so we were hesitant but so glad that we waited; plus the food came out relatively quickly. Would definitely return if ever back in Knoxville.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nikki A.,"Tupelo, MS",11/7/2019,5.0,"Yummy food, giant portions and a bourbon list that will satisfy even the most discriminating palate!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cody E.,"Knoxville, TN",1/31/2021,3.0,"Me and my fiancé went here to try out a new place. While the food was amazing, we feel the service wasn't up to par. We felt as though the staff was short with us and ill tempered. We felt very unwelcome and unwanted."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dave W.,"Mechanicsville, VA",8/6/2019,5.0,"Mostly a burger place but oh what a burger. Definitely top notch. Plenty of craft cocktails, huge whiskey/bourbon selection, but back to the burger. I would say it would be very hard to make a better burger than this. Pair with house made fries or like myself-onion rings and you will be in for a real treat. They do have salads and chicken options as well but the burger is really on point."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dan M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/18/2018,5.0,Great burgers. Period. All you need to know. Also have a great selection of Bourbon (including Pappy).
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Meghan P.,"Indianapolis, IN",10/31/2019,5.0,Stopped here on our road trip and it didn't disappoint. I had the salmon cake burger and he had the steakhouse burger. Got it under 10 minutes and we'll it didn't last long. Tons of bourbons but we stuck to the local drafts. Must try place if in the Knoxville area! Will be back!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mitch M.,"Pismo Beach, CA",12/4/2020,4.0,"I liked this place so much, I came two days in a row while visiting Knoxville. Great burgers. beer and wine were good too. Typical bar type restaurant so a little noisy/crowded, but nice."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dennis L.,"Fayetteville, GA",12/6/2019,5.0,Probably one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Plus you get to have a flight of bourbon along with it? Absolutely yes. We'll be back for sure!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley T.,"Knoxville, TN",7/1/2018,4.0,"Not too shabby! Came here on a whim. We eventually want to try out all the restaurants in Market Square. The vibe is real pubby like, decor is on point. The staff is so sweet, attentive, and amazing. They are at your beck and call.I had the Fried Shrooms as an appetizer. The flavor was good. It had like an Asian sweet sauce on top, which I thought was unique. Some pieces had too much of a mushroom flavor in it but some were sooooo juicy and tasteful. It came with a horseradish type dipping sauce I believe. It was good but don't have too much of it. It gave me an odd fume that ran through my nostrils from mouth lol.I ordered The Billy with onion rings. And omg, my first bite into this burger ....literally melted in my mouth like burger. I asked for the beef to be cooked medium and it was just that. Cooked to perfection. It was so soft and fluffy & had all sorts of flavors that tie in so well together. The whole burger just melted in my mouth, and it was so filling. I could not finish the entree. I also had the duck fries and I'm not sure but it didn't meet the hype for me. I've read so many reviews that people loved it so much, but I couldn't find that in it. It was alright. + Garlic aioli sauce ummmmmm yummmmmm - can you ever go wrong with that on the side???Very nice people. Very nice vibe. The restaurant itself is pretty tight so expect a wait. As for us, we walked right in and they sat us immediately on a Sunday lunch."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,charlotte k.,"Ansley Park, Atlanta, GA",9/19/2020,1.0,"It's been 8 hours and I still haven't gotten my text for the table. We were told we would only have to wait 15-30 minutes. Clearly, it has been a little over the estimated wait time. It seems rather obvious now that they did not even attempt to seat us. I will most likely never return and it ruined my trip to Market Square."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nate C.,"Dallas, TX",10/22/2018,5.0,"Went here for a burger, was not disappointed. Tried the buffalo burger, it was a unique twist and a definite upgrade from an average burger. Staff was friendly. After a long day exploring the Great Smoky Mountains, it was exactly what I needed."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,LA O.,"Morristown, TN",3/9/2016,4.0,"We actually learned about Stock and Barrel while on the Bourbon Trail tour in Kentucky. On our way home, we decided to stop and my husband was impressed with the bourbon selections. Burgers are creative...Elvis has peanut butter and banana. Farmhouse has a fresh fried egg. They also have specials and each time we have returned, there has been a very tempting special burger featured. They have great salads as well!The wait, even at 4:30 is a half hour or so. The seating is pretty limited and the popularity is evident! They do have a text notification system, so you can shop other places in the Square and be close enough to quickly return for your table. Sit near the door and prepare to FREEZE in the winter...we pray for a table in the back so we don't have to keep coats on through the meal. VERY yummy, creative and interesting menu without being all man-bun/hipster/dorky beard catering as too many places have become."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Payton S.,"Novi, MI",12/30/2019,5.0,Stopped here while on a road trip down to Atlanta. SO GOOD!!! I got the steakhouse burger and it was hands down the best burger I've ever had. Also got the Black Betty drink & it was delicious. Wish I lived closer!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gabe G.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",11/13/2018,5.0,"A must have when in Knoxville. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I wasn't a fan of the duck confit fries but my coworker enjoyed them, the onion rings were perfect in every way, service was fast and friendly. You'll probably have to wait as the restaurant is small and busy, but worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cyril B.,"Bellerose, NY",12/18/2016,5.0,"Stopped in Knoxville for one meal, and I'm glad it was at the Stock and Barrel. On a road trip from Houston to NYC, eating here was a step away from the BBQ of Tennessee, but a great quality burger regardless of state.I ordered the Big Nasty ($18), a monstrous burger featuring double everything: meat, bacon, cheese, and fried onions (also topped with tomato jam and mayo.) Served alongside this burger were duck confit fries, an upgrade available for only another $2.Stop by here if you want two meals for, well, the price of two meals. $20 for a burger that I will definitely take home to eat later? Sign me up. Another note, the waitress I had was very friendly and quick to serve. Should I stop through Knoxville again, I'l definitely hit up the Stock & Barrel."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sherry T.,"Tacoma, WA",7/1/2016,4.0,"Holy crap, the burgers!!!!  I had the Bernie, and let me tell you, the way sweet blueberry preserves played with the salty bacon and those lovely Bleu cheese crumbles, it was magical! Of course it never hurts to have excellent quality grass-fed beef.  Man, I wish we had burgers like this in Cincinnati!Unlike the burgers, the fries were awful. I don't think there was a grain of salt on them. Ugh!Service and atmosphere were great. It's a small place, so arrive early if you want a seat."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,J. J.,"Ann Arbor, MI",12/24/2019,4.0,"First...the food. Simply put...it's pretty darned amazing. We take out-of-town guests here and regardless of where they're from, they're always impressed. Had a colleague from Austin say it was the best burger he's ever had! Ingredients are high quality, recipes are creative, and atmosphere is great.  Do yourself a favor and upgrade to the duck confit fries!  Second...the service.  This is where they lose a star with me. They are generally busy and I respect that servers aren't always in the best mood, but do servers have to repeatedly sigh or roll their eyes when you ask for refills or more ketchup?  Probably not.  Still...the food will keep me coming back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Caroline A.,"Nashville, TN",1/30/2020,5.0,"I came with 2 friends at about 7PM on a Sunday night and we waited ~20 minutes for a high top table. Here is a review of the food we had:Bison burger: I don't even love burgers, but this was one of the BEST burgers I've ever had! The boursin cheese and crispy onions were perfect. The Hurt Locker: this is the one with pimento cheese. I didn't try any of it but my friend ate all of hers and said it was great. The Dead Head: this is the quinoa + black bean burger. It was delicious! It had a really smooth texture (not dry at all, but if you really need texture in your veggie burgers this might not be the one for you) and the smashed avocado. Personally, I thought it was delicious and would definitely order again. Duck fat fries: AMAZING. The portions were huge and the flavor was so intensely savory. Village tomato salad: this is a warm salad served in a small skillet. It was delicious! Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone-- the burgers are delicious and they have salads and salmon/black bean burgers if meat isn't your thing. Ambience was fun and loud but no need to shout to hear each other."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lauren O.,"Atlanta, GA",10/10/2018,5.0,Amazing burgers. Our entire party of 14 loved what then ordered. Food came out quickly. I upgraded to the mac and cheese side and it came out in a mini skillet with some scallions and was amazing. The onion rings and fries were both good too. There were lots of burger options - not just beef. They were very accommodating to our large party and helped us find a way to get seated as soon as possible. The staff also managed all of our orders correctly and well.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian W.,"Lexington, KY",11/28/2016,4.0,Cool little place near campus. Only complaint is the size of the building. Buts it's in a Plaza that you can walk around while you wait. Super high quality burgers. The duck confit fries are so good it will make you shun all other fries. Worth the wait. Eat there soon!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nick M.,"North Logan, UT",8/10/2018,5.0,"We were very impressed with how fresh and authentic everything tasted.  From the juicy beef of the burger to the satisfying taste of the bun, this is one of the best gourmet burger joints we have visited in a long time.  The Black and Blue was a delicious burger, the duck confit fries were addicting, and the onion rings contained thick juicy onions the put nearly all other onion rings in this world to shame.Next time we visit Knoxville, we'll be sure to grab another bite at Stock and Barrel."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sam B.,"Evansville, IN",3/9/2018,5.0,"It's been a few months since I visited Stock & Barrel and I still remember it vividly. Environment was claustrophobic, but in a good way somehow!Burger was fantastic as expected... anytime the question of best burger in Knoxville comes up, S&B is always number one on the list. Lived up to the hype.Duck fries were nice, worth tasting but not critical to the experience!Price... not too much in my opinion. You know what you're getting into. There isn't a dollar menu at S&B. Can't miss out on this place."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Phil J.,"Orange Park, FL",10/19/2019,2.0,"I had high hopes for this place but it was a bit of a disappointment. The drink prices are very high and the pour is not great. The burgers were ok but not the best ever. There was nice flavor and seasoning on the meat but the bun fell apart quickly and it had to be eaten with a fork. Service was ok, but not great. We ate here on a Thursday night around 8pm. Given the other choices in market square you can do better, especially for the price."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Charles N.,"Conway, AR",5/27/2018,5.0,"Amazing burger joint. The duck fat fries were amazing. The duck fat flavor was subtle and not over powering. They were served with a garlic aoli that was delicious. I ordered the Bernie burger. It was Soo good. Jam, battered and fried jalapenosis, and goat cheese on a burger? Yes please! The jalapenos were spicy. It was fantastic. To try and be healthy, I ordered the black beans and corn salad on the side. It was the most underwhelming part of the meal, but it was alright.I'd go here again to eat the fries and the Bernie burger."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amanda G.,"Morganton, NC",8/17/2018,5.0,Whitley provided fabulous service. The farm burger and duck fries with aioli was to die for!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shannon M.,"Prospect, KY",11/3/2019,5.0,"Best onion rings around. I really enjoyed their burger dubbed The Hurt Locker. It was all very good, and the service was great, and the location was very enjoyable. I will definitely dine here again, and give it my highest recommendation."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lisa K.,"Jefferson City, TN",9/27/2020,4.0,"our first visit here, been wanting to try for a while, Sunday afternoon, late lunch, sat at the Bar, NFL football was on, beer was cold, i hit American Burger it was very filling, had to cut into half to eat, my husband got Bison burger, was good , homemade fries, very good... it you want a burger i would suggest trying it out..."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kristen M.,"Cincinnati, OH",9/28/2018,5.0,"Great burgers, frieds, milkshakes, and service! The inside is on the small side but there's a patio. Love the atmosphere. My husband has been here a few times before and now I know why. We'll definitely return!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David B.,"Market Square, Knoxville, TN",12/5/2020,5.0,"Best burgers in Knoxville by far. This place is the GOAT. If you slander S&B, we can't be friends."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bianca D.,"Plano, TX",9/17/2018,3.0,This place has a cute vibe to it. I got the Pacifico draft and tasted like a Blue Moon. Got the Steakhouse burger and added bacon on it. Bacon was really good and the meat was cooked well. Fries were kinda soggy and tasted like old oil honestly. It was any other burger place in my opinion
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael G.,"Redlands, CA",7/14/2018,5.0,"Supposed to be in the top 5 burger places in nation.  They did not dissapoint.  I used yelp to add me to list; easy.  The wait was a little longer,  no big deal.  Plenty to do for an hour or so on that street.  There is a nice movie theatre nearby.  We did some shopping and people watching while we waited-there is even a University of Tennessee Volunteers store there.  Burgers are great,  very descriptive; I had the bison medium.  Salad was good as they do have a kids menu too.  Just ask for it. Only two restrooms( unisex) when busy may have a short wait...  Also the kentucky Burbon beer is a must,  not to strong,  not happy either.  Definitely will be back when passing through... Great service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Derielle K.,"Oklahoma City, OK",12/21/2019,5.0,This might be one of the best burgers I have ever had! Absolutely in the top 3. Everyone in my group loved their burgers and their pimento cheese is so fantastic. Kind of a small place so would recommend getting on the wait list ahead of time. Would 100% recommend this place for fantastic burgers and drinks!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Andrea K.,"Gatlinburg, TN",8/12/2019,5.0,"My favorite place to eat in Knoxville. The burgers are consistantly amazing and worth the wait & price. We put our name in on the weekend, and we are in by the time we have one beer across the square at Scruffy's. The appetizers are all worth trying, the burgers are interesting and delicious (my favorite being the Bernie), and the duck fries are a must. If you somehow have room for dessert, the shakes are great too. Worth visiting if you are from out of town and worth coming back to for locals!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Audrey B.,"Valparaiso, IN",12/18/2018,5.0,"This place was in a what seemed like an arts district, super cute! There was a tiny little ice rink in the middle and little shops all around. I liked the atmosphere, kind of a rustic feel. The food was excellent. The fried mushrooms were super tasty! My husband said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashlee B.,"Bogart, GA",2/16/2019,5.0,"This was our first time in Knoxville and it was absolutely amazing. Many times when told that the wait time exceeds an hour the food will not be worth it, but this place was totally worth it. The customer service was stellar. This place is on the top of our list for the next time we come to Knoxville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael S.,"Cocoa, FL",7/31/2016,4.0,Everybody in our group of four had the bison burger with the duck confit fries it was all cooked to Perfection and absolutely excellent I would eat there again
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Barbara S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",2/4/2018,4.0,"Stopped here passing through Knoxville, and boy was I not disappointed! This place makes a mean burger! I got the bacon burger and my boyfriend had the farmhouse burger. We both agreed that these burgers in our top 5... The burgers were nice and savory and perfectly cooked to our liking. The macaroni was good, could have had some more flavor but still good nonetheless. Dessert was my favorite part... we got the famous s'mores shake! It was ah-mazing. From the roasted marshmallows to the graham cracker and the creamy s'mores combo. The server was very nice, the place was small but cozy. We will definitely be back!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stephanie K.,"Fort Myers, FL",12/30/2015,5.0,"The food, the atmosphere, the service and did I mention the food?, was fantastic. While staying in town for a wedding we decided to stop here for dinner and I'm so glad we did! It was a cool night and we sat outside on the patio and had no wait.We all ordered a burger and two of us tried the duck frites on a recommendation and I'm so glad we did! They are a must try!I got the special of the night (the name is escaping me) but it had pimento cheese, bacon, tomato, and fried jalapeños. The jalapeños were fresh (none of that canned stuff) and was the perfect amount of heat. It was a great melding of flavors and the price can't be beat!The service was friendly, prompt and courteous. When in Knoxville be sure to put this on your list!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Meghan R.,"Kansas City, MO",10/23/2020,5.0,Possibly one of the best burgers I've ever had. #hurtlocker. Sat at the bar. Great service and they had pernicious on tap
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Candy M.,"Chandler, AZ",9/14/2020,2.0,This would have been a much better experience if our server Casey had been interested in us.  She would not give advice or recommend anything on the menu and was surprised when we pointed out things on the menu.  (As if she hadn't even read it.). It took her a good five minutes to greet us and then she sent someone else to check on us after we got our food.  As we were getting ready to order desert she seemed like she was done with us so we decided not to order dessert and left.  Food was good.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",10/9/2015,5.0,"When I feel like a fatty and want a juicy burger, I come here and splurge. If you want to be an ultimate fatty, order the duck fries that are literally saturated in duck fat. It is normal to be on the wait list for 30+ minutes. However, you want to think ahead and download the ""NoWait"" app. Here you can put your name down on the list from home about a couple of hours out depending on the wait time. Then you would arrange the perfect time to leave the house in order to checkin line in person. WOW mind blowing - smart thinking - line waiting no more.I get the Farmhouse burger mid-rare. How could you not order this and salivate over the fried egg on top. The egg really adds another level of complexity and texture to the overall meal. I also get a side of onion rings that are deep fried to perfection. Their regular fries are pretty good too. Their drinks are stiff and their beer selection is always my go-to."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lisa L.,"Maryville, TN",7/7/2018,5.0,This was our first visit to Market Square. We were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was great and the food was excellent. The burgers are juicy and they have so much flavor. We will definitely go back!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Richard L.,"Eupora, MS",1/21/2018,5.0,"We were here last night and it was a 1-1/2 hour wait. We didn't wait but wanted to see what all the fuss was about so we came back the next morning for lunch. Simply put, possibly the best burger I've ever had and I'm pretty picky. We see why the wait was so long now"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ryan C.,"Antioch, CA",8/30/2019,5.0,"This place reminds me of my restaurant in California except we didn't have a 1/4 of their bourbon. Servers are always friendly especially the 18 year old bartender with his hilarious dad jokes. Food has always been good, I've only ever had one issue and it was quickly resolved. That burger was still mooing."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie Z.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",12/31/2015,5.0,"We stopped here on our first night in Knoxville and the reviews do not lie, this place is great! Stock and Barrel is right in the heart of market square so it's super easy to get to! I enjoyed the Hurt Locker, which is a delicious burger with pimento cheese, a fried green tomato and bacon! You can tell the pimento cheese is home made and it's got a little heat to it! I also enjoyed their duck fries- crispy with lots of cheese and chives! For beverages I had a tom Collins which the bartender made just right! They also had a list of other fun cocktails.  If you're looking for a great burger in a cool casual atmosphere this is your place!  If you can see if you can make a reservation,  we didn't and the wait was about 35 minutes for indoor seating, there is also outdoor seating which didn't have a wait so my and my group chose to sit there, we're from Florida so we enjoyed the chilly weather."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kathy M.,"Swannanoa, NC",7/8/2018,5.0,I ate here for late Sunday burger and duck fat fries. Service is spot on so don't be worried about that!  Got the Bernie burger which is a popper effect on great beef and a bun to die for. I got the onion rings instead of Fries.  Great and great!!! The desserts looked amazing but next time coming thru I'll remember!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lauren E.,"Marietta, GA",1/13/2019,5.0,Our first time to Knoxville and we stopped here for dinner. It's in a great location and there's lot of restaurants to choose from. The food was FANTASTIC! And the atmosphere was really cute! Some of the best burgers we've had and I would definitely recommend it. There is a parking garage next door with very responsible rates (I believe it was $1/hour). We went on a Friday evening around 5 and it wasn't super busy yet and we didn't have a wait. But it got busier later on. Fun area to walk around and explore.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Steven C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/12/2018,5.0,"Burgers.Guilt-free (from an eco-friendly standpoint, NOT speaking calorically here)Who could ask for anything more?"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Laura P.,"Summerville, SC",6/27/2016,5.0,"Best bison burger ever!!! Duck confit fries were pretty amazing also.They don't have an actual kids menu, but they accommodated our 3 kids with burgers, Mac n cheese and fries. Finished with an awesome Nutella shake. Highly recommend if visiting market square in Knoxville"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel H.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/21/2018,4.0,"I've heard lots if people talk about this place but had never tried it. The wait time is excessive and they don't take reservations. The food, however, was worth the wait. We tried the opa fried feta topped with honey and served with bread as an appetizer, it was delicious. I tried the bison burger which I was expecting to be more flavorful than it actually was. It came with the duck confit fries which were rich, but very good. The portions are huge so it will make 2 meals for me. Overall, I enjoyed the experience."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Melissa C.,"Gautier, MS",7/16/2018,4.0,Amazing wonderful food spectacular whiskey selection. The duck confit fries will change your li
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Erin C.,"Powell, TN",8/2/2018,5.0,"Y'all, if you can make it to downtown Knoxville market Square you have got to eat here. It is one of the best burgers around and they have such a huge selection! I love all of their toppings and their ducks fries are out of this world.The atmosphere is amazing and so neat. It's a smaller place so be prepared to wait, but the wait is totally worth it. The bar is awesome with all of their selection right on the wall. All of the TVs make it a great place to kill time while you're waiting for your table."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jared D.,"Crockett, VA",1/5/2019,3.0,"As far as the food goes. I was pretty impressed. Burgers were good, Duck fat fries were phenomenal. I would go there just for that. I'm a bourbon drinker so I loved the selection. My one complaint is that we were texted that our table was ready. Five minutes later when we arrive at the front desk the hostess informed us that they gave our table away to a couple that was on the list, didn't show up on time, and then came back. We waited another 45 min for a table. Not ideal."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ty B.,"Hamilton, OH",6/13/2018,3.0,"Was looking forward to a great dinner after seeing all the wonderful Yelp reviews. I hate to say I was pretty underwhelmed! Good, just not great. Fortunately, I didn't have a wait like most people have said. I ordered the Black and Blue Burger medium, but it came out closer to well done. The blue cheese fondue had very little blue cheese flavor, and the bacon was undercooked and looked/tasted like it wasn't cooked fresh. The burger itself was good, but both the beef and the onion straws could have used some seasoning. The whole burger just tasted dry. Maybe something was up with the blue cheese fondue the night I went? The fries were okay, but nothing out of this world. I should have went with the duck confit fries. My server was great and extremely friendly. I wish the meal had lived up to my expectation because it's a cool spot!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",5/16/2018,5.0,This place has the best fries and their burger selection is on point. If you like whiskey they also have a good variety to choose from. If you want something other than whiskey it might leave you wanting but if you're going here you already know whiskey is their thing. I wish the place was a little bigger as seating can feel cramped when they are busy but honestly that's something I can live with. Maybe try calling ahead but they have a great system where they text when your table is ready so feel free to shop around in the mean time
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/4/2015,5.0,"I really don't think there is a better place for wild, creative, amazing burgers in Knoxville!!!  Such as the Bernie:  bacon, blue cheese and blueberry preserves.  Wow!  I didn't try the Elvis with peanut butter and bacon - but I shall!  Add to that well over 100 whiskeys (mostly Bourbon - the best version of whisky), and I could show up here daily!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mary B.,"Burlington, KY",1/2/2020,4.0,"We came here the night after Christmas and it was hopping. We were seated right away. The tables are close together. The burger options on the menu are varied and all of them sounded delicious. I ordered the Hurt Locker which had pimento cheese, bacon and a fried green tomato on it. It was outstanding! Cooked correctly, juicy, the cheese had a bit of spicy bite to it. The fries that came with my burger were just ok, not hot enough for me. My husband ordered a black and blue burger and was not disappointed, we both loved the smoky taste of the bacon on our burgers. The reason I am not giving a 5 star review is because the service was slow. Our water was never refilled and we had to ask for the check. Good food, generous portions, decent prices."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rheannon M.,"Tampa Bay, FL",5/8/2018,5.0,"Highest quality burgers in town.  The fried mushroom caps are my favorite.  Duck fat fries. Yes.  Every time.  I can't say I've ever had anything I DIDN'T like here, although after trying some of the more eccentric burgers (like the Elvis inspired one), I now stay more basic.  If you've never been here, you won't be disappointed.  The wait times aren't for nothing."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Demetria M.,"Memphis, TN",7/18/2018,3.0,"Burgers were ok , a bit salty , fries were good but also salty. The crab dip was amazing ! And we had the sweetest waitress ever."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Macy M.,"Baton Rouge, LA",12/28/2015,5.0,"How have I never done a review for Stock and Barrel? This place is definitely one of Knoxville's trendiest restaurants and for good reason! Despite the tiny interior and frequent Long wait time, Stock and Barrel is a hit! They are known for unique burgers, a wide variety of bourbon and whiskey drinks and for me, the duck confit fries. On my recent visit, I tried the black and bleu burger and my boyfriend had the Bernie (which was new for me since our last visit!). The black and bleu is topped with bleu cheese fondue, onion straws, Benton's bacon and blackening seasoning. I love this burger, but the bleu cheese fondue wasn't as delicious as I anticipated. It came out already somewhat setup with a film on top. Also, there wasn't much of a bleu cheese kick, but overall it's a great burger. I opted for the duck confit fries, which are a favorite! They come with a delicious sauce, which really enhances the flavor. They certainly aren't on a healthy diet, but they're a great indulgent treat. The Bernie burger is topped with fried jalapeños, bleu cheese and blueberry preserves. This is so delicious! I know what you're thinking, what a strange combination, but it's outstanding. It reminded me of baked brie with preserves with a burger thrown in the mix. We had the Mac n cheese as another side. I love their Mac n cheese! It's extra creamy with a nice kick to it. We had a few bourbon drinks, which were also excellent, and perfectly accompanied with ice balls. Nice touch. The service is always hospitable, accommodating and friendly here. Even though they're known for long waits, come at an off time, and I recommend coming as a party of 2 or less. It's slightly pricier than other Knoxville burger joints, but the few extra dollars are really worth the increased quality in ingredients. Check it out!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Evelyn G.,"Chattanooga, TN",8/12/2015,5.0,"Fried chicken, bacon, red-leaf lettuce and tomato in between two waffles? Yes please!!!! And unlimited sweet ice tea refills? I must be in heaven! First day, first time and first meal in Knoxville and I hit the jackpot. Dana, my server, took excellent care of me and checked up frequently, never letting my sweet ice tea get below half full. I paid the extra $2 and upgraded to the delicious duck confit fries...I wish I had a bigger stomach, between the fries and the sandwhich I made it only half way through each before waving the white flag. Next time I'm going to try out one of their infamous burgers. With duck confit fries ;)"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lauren D.,"Broken Arrow, OK",6/24/2019,5.0,Fabulous food! Great atmosphere. We had burgers fries and all the apps. Delicious bacon! Everything we had was great. Loved the fried pickles and cheese dip apps! Also a great selection of beers and drinks!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Hannah G.,"Knoxville, TN",2/14/2020,3.0,"I've been a total of 3 times and the first time it was GREAT which is why I recommended going back the second time with my boss. Second time was eh and I thought maybe it was just the burger I chose but the 3rd time I wasn't sold, especially for the prices. All of the drinks I've ever gotten from the bar have been GREAT! I'm allergic to peanuts so it was nice to have the server ask if anyone had any food or nut allergies (because I'm assuming they mix things in the kitchen/try not to because there is peanuts served on some burgers) but our server didn't ask the third time we went which made we wary because he forgot to ask and if it had been my first time - would I have even thought to say anything? Maybe I'm just being paranoid but you can never be too safe with a life threatening allergy."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Karen N.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",8/4/2017,1.0,"I wish I could give negative stars. I rarely care enough to give a bad review, but this is definitely an exception. There is no excuse for how we were treated here. We (my husband and I) tried to eat here for lunch about a month ago. When we arrived and gave the hostess our names, she said there was one party ahead of us and it would only be approximately a 10 minute wait. She wasn't friendly, but she wasn't overtly rude either. We're pretty easy going, but 30 minutes, and at least four seated parties later (who seemed to know the hostess), we still hadn't been given a table. No one else was standing across from her, so she didn't forget we were there, but she didn't look up from her phone to acknowledged us again either. We saw several tables open, so my (very irritated by this time) husband went to ask why were weren't given a table. Not only did she completely ignore him, she started playing with her phone. I'm not sure what was going on, but I pulled him out of there before she got the words she deserved. I'm sure she was too busy playing with her phone and gossiping with her co-workers to notice. I guess they didn't need our money. I should send them a bill for our wasted time, and parking...."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2018,5.0,Hubby was craving a burger so gotta have the best. We're never disappointed here. Burger tender and cooked as ordered. Everything is fresh and tasty. Drinks were perfect. Service timely and spot on.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",7/1/2017,5.0,"Where to start. I can see why this was voted top 10 burgers in America.  We checked in and the hostess said it could be up to an hour, they'd text us. We got a text within 20 minutes. Wonderful cuz we were starving. Our fountain drinks and appetizer came out super fast. We had the fried green tomatoes. The batter was nice and light, they were cooked nicely- not raw like many places, and had just the right amount of goat cheese and balsamic. I ordered ""The Billy"" well done. The meat was cooked perfectly. There was no pink and the beef was seasoned. No extra condiments were wanted on the burger, the flavors of the goat cheese, tomato jam, bourbon caramelized onions, and Bentons Bacon was perfection. I upgraded to the dick fries, but their regular hand cut fries were just as good. I ordered an extra side of the black bean and corn salad- my opinion may have needed a little more acid, but the flavors were great. My cocktail was awesome. I had the bourbon, lemonade cocktail with muddled strawberry and basil. Deliciousness in a glass!  The local bakery made burger buns hold up beautifully while eating the burger. My husband had the. My husband had the Classic Bacon Burger. Again, cooked perfectly while still being tender and flavorful. The house made pickles are great!  Fries were awesome too. Stock & Barrel is definitely worth the wait. The food is awesome!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mia S.,"Ethridge, TN",7/21/2018,3.0,"Went to stock and barrel on a Thursday evening for dinner. Arrived around 6pm and had approximately a half hour wait. The waiter took our drink orders, our appetizer orders and gave us some sass when we told him we were ready to order our entrees.The four of us split the opa and the fried mushrooms. The opa is a slice of feta that is fried and served with some baguette chunks and honey. Very delicious. The fried mushrooms were tasty and served with horseradish.My burger was the shroomin' mushroom burger. Sauteed mushrooms, cheese and horseradish topped the perfectly cooked burger. Waaayyy too much horseradish. The duck confit fries were the best part and you got a very healthy serving!The others had the free bird turkey burger, the grilled chicken motherclucker, and a house special burger topped with chorizo, and jalapenos. More confit fries and a side of onion rings. They all said it was delicious. The chicken sandwich did fall to pieces. It was hard to eat. The waiter wasn't friendly or very attentive. The music and atmosphere was way too loud but I love the building and the decor.Because my burger was overpowered by horseradish and the waiter was kind of a dick, I'm going with 3.5 stars. But we will go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Emily E.,"Williamsburg, VA",10/13/2019,4.0,"Stock & Barrel is so dang good! Every time I go I try to make myself order something different. It's a cool little restaurant and my go-to for a good burger! Side note: I have never had a bad meal there. Key word being ""there"". Don't get food to-go. Every time I have tried to get to-go burgers from here the bread gets super soggy really fast."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Austin J.,"Odum, GA",9/26/2020,5.0,"BEST BURGER EVER! Me and my wife stopped by this place while we were visiting Knoxville. We sat outside due to nice weather so I can't speak for inside the restaurant. Our waitress was amazing, the menu was huge and when I got my food.. wow. I got the Walker Texas Ranger Burger (special of the day?) with half and half (fries and onion rings) and my wife got the Bernie. Hands down best burgers we have ever had and my wife doesn't even like burgers. I'll come back to this place every time I'm in Knoxville. Great job!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Carter O.,"Morristown, TN",12/4/2015,5.0,I got the classic bacon cheese burger. Awesome.  Cooked perfect.  Eclectic selection of burgers.  They will have a burger or sandwich (or salad if you must) for anyone.  If you can't find something to eat here you don't need to be eating.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Austin G.,"Springfield, IL",10/7/2018,5.0,"Great food! I ordered the black and Blue. Probably the best I've had so far. The fried pickles are also fantastic. The environment was a little crowded, but other than that there was no other qualms. I would definitely recommend it again"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Douglas P.,"New Market, TN",4/13/2018,3.0,Always a wait here. We were lucky to get only 35 minutes.  Good burgers. But duck fries are the bomb.  Large selection of Bourbons and other whiskeys.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Big D.,"Knoxville, TN",8/2/2019,4.0,"Great food, good drinks. Almost always a wait to get in, but it's worth it. Get the half onion rings and fries with your order!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gabby W.,"Mechanicsville, Knoxville, TN",12/1/2019,5.0,They don't lie about having the BEST BURGERS in Knoxville but I'm not from here and they have the BEST burgers I've had in my life from anywhere I've visited!! My bf and I have brought almost 10 people here who also agree and were blown away! Love their food!!!! Mac and cheese is bomb! If there is a wait trust me it is worth it!! Always a pleasure here.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dan H.,"Berkeley, CA",7/11/2015,5.0,"I never ever ever give five stars to restaurants. But as you can see, this burger joint gets full marks, so there must be something special about it.I first heard about Stock & Barrel from the Metro Pulse's (RIP) list of best restaurants in Knoxville. The first time I came here, the line was out the door and I didn't even bother going in. As I soon found out, there was a reason the line was so long.I came here with a group of about 10 friends to get a meal before a Symphony concert. Fortunately, we came early so there was no wait (even for such a large group). Tip for those who want to eat here: definitely try to get here early! Our server was great; he was quite friendly and gave suggestions. Since there weren't too many people, he asked about our formal dress and we found out that he was actually a classical music lover. In addition, my drink never even got close to half full. Very prompt about getting us new drinks,  but I suspect this wouldn't have been the case on a busy night.I loved the ambiance here. Sort of dark, but well-lit enough to read the menu. Definitely had a bit of a hipster feel to it. Everything was clean, no complaints there.On to the food: I got a Hurt Locker (comes with fries). My experience in a nutshell: I see the light! Definitely deserves the ""best burger in Knoxville"" title. Fries were crisp, unlike some other burger joints. They could have a bit more flavor, but nothing bad about them at all. As for the burger, I was definitely surprised after I had the first bite. I still remember the taste of the pimiento cheese (yum) -- perfectly complemented the natural flavor of the burger. Although I don't care too much for tomatoes, the fried green tomato was still a nice touch.I was debating whether to give 4 or 5 stars because the wait on regular nights is just ridiculous. However, it didn't feel right to dock a star because they're popular, so I ultimately decided on the 5 star rating. Even though you maybe be able to get a cheaper burger elsewhere, a burger of this quality for $10-15 is a steal. Excellent place for a meal!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Zue W.,"Goodyear, AZ",3/7/2018,5.0,It definitively lives up to the expectations. Their burgers are really good! I had the one with pimento cheese and it was  One of the best burgers I've ever had. Their fries are hand cut. They also have other combinations and ingredients you would not expect in a Burger like goat cheese.  I eat tends to get crowded so get there early.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Aek H.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",7/9/2017,4.0,Very good .. burgers were juicy and flavorful.  We tried the lamb burger and the mushroom burger.  Both were excellent.  I got onion rings .. light and airy.  My daughter got the mac and cheese .. a little bland.  We also got the duck grease French fries .. very good but as an appetizer it was not worth it.  Same size as a side.  Overall would definitely come back.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matthew H.,"Atlanta, GA",10/15/2017,5.0,Never had a bad burger from this place! Overall great beer choices and be sure to grab the confit fries! They will not disappoint you. Depending on a burger or waffle chicken burger you will enjoy whatever you get!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alice S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/25/2019,4.0,"5-star burger w/ high quality local beef, fresh bun, great toppings. We get the ""billy"" every time: goat cheese, tomato salsa, and bacon. It just works. Amazing fries come with.The Nutella shake, on the other hand, was thin, served in a plastic cup, and had no chopped hazelnuts. Just ok, especially given the gourmet price. Go down the street to The Pharmacy for a great shake. Focus on the burgers here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessica L.,"Grapeland Heights, Miami, FL",8/20/2017,1.0,"I used to like coming here. But after venturing in today, I probably won't be back. After sitting down at the bar on a mediocre Sunday (meaning it wasn't as busy as it usually is), we were able to order drinks and food from the female bartender on duty. We found out ten mins later our order was never rung in, so I'm sitting here watching the people who came in 10 mins after me eating food while I'm still sitting here waiting for mine. Unacceptable!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Anna Beth M.,"Johnson City, TN",11/23/2019,5.0,"We absolutely love Stock & Barrel. After eating there twice now, it's at least tied for our favorite in Market Square. The service is always wonderful, the food is just delicious (especially the fries!), and we never have to wait long at all. You won't regret trying it!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Karli S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/12/2020,5.0,"I only eat burgers that my brother or stock and barrel makes. I know the owners of the farm that produces the beef and can attest that it's high quality and the animals have a high quality of life. The buns are made locally, too, as well as the ice cream. Seriously the best burger I've ever had. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sean M.,"Belle Morris, Knoxville, TN",11/20/2019,5.0,I absolutely love this place. They have delicious gourmet burgers with a generous helping of fries (the duck fries are where it's at!).  The bar has an amazing selection of Bourbon and Whiskey that would excite and impress anyone. My only complaint is that there is usually a long wait to be seated...but that's just a testament to how good they are!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert D.,"Newburgh, IN",11/20/2019,5.0,"My go to burger spot. Expect to spend about $20 per person ($13 burger price + tax + tip + maybe a Coke), but also expect a great burger! My favorite thing about the menu is that each burger has its own distinct flavor and flair unlike many other places where a BBQ burger is like any other burger plus BBQ sauce... A Hawaiian burger is like any other burger plus a pineapple. Stock and Barrel doesn't operate that way and is my go to spot for not only when I'm craving a burger but when I have have out of town guests and I want to put Knoxville's best foot forward."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John R.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7/20/2019,5.0,"Probably the best burgers I've ever had while traveling.  Always consistent and cooked correctly. That's important.  An over cooked burger is dry and disgusting and these guys get it right every time I order.  Close your eyes and point to a burger on the menu and whatever your finger lands on, you will enjoy. The different craft ingredient selection allows your taste buds to step outside of their comfort zone and explore combinations not typically thought of at home or conventional burger joints."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Natalya R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",8/6/2019,5.0,Wonderful food! Great vibes! Definitely worth the wait! The Mother Clucker was delicious!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nancy H.,"Sevierville, TN",10/2/2017,4.0,Great place to dine while on Market Square.  The burgers are very large.  The duck fat fries are superb!  The heirloom tomato salad is fantastic.  Great place and nicest atmosphere!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tyler C.,"Winfield, MO",9/10/2019,5.0,"We were coming in from a long drive with two tired, cranky kids and decided to get takeout. Stock & Barrel did not disappoint. The burger and macaroni were delicious, and the best part, after 20 minutes, the fries were still super crispy!! Stressed out, hangry parents dream!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6/13/2017,5.0,We were in Knoxville for a tour of the stadium and looked for where we had the best reviews in the area since we only had time for one meal here. Yelp lead us to Stock & Barrel and it did not disappoint. Easily the second best burger I've ever had in mylife. I got the Shroomin' burger and fries. It was incredible! I love mushrooms so it was nice that this burger had a bunch of different kinds. It was juicy and not greasy at all. I did however get the garlic aioli in place of the horseradish sauce which for me was a great way to go! This is a burger that i'll be craving which is unfortunate because I have no idea when I'll find myself in Knoxville again but i'm so glad we came acrossed this place!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Prudence P.,"Knoxville, TN",8/1/2019,5.0,"God, how I adore this place.  They are always packed, but the wait is totally worth it.  The Billy is my favorite burger of all time (meat cooked perfectly with goat cheese, Benton's bacon, bourbon onions and a tomato chutney).  I'm not a huge fan of their regular fries, but the duck fat fries are on point.  Their onion rings are also delightfully crisp.  The restaurant itself can be kind of loud, so this is not somewhere you go on a first date and want to be able to enjoy an intimate conversation...maybe it's where you go to dump someone, though?  Excellent burgers, bourbon, and no one will be able to understand the hateful things your date is yelling at you.  This is hands down the best burger place in Knoxville; couldn't recommend it more highly for the food. Service can be spotty."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Meme P.,"Niceville, FL",7/30/2019,5.0,"We are from out of town and decided to try Stock & Trade based on reviews and also we were craving burgers. This place did not disappoint.  We started with the fried pickles. Wow!  The best I've ever had!  They were thin and crispy and just the right amount of pickle tartness.  We all enjoyed our burgers and I could tell the quality of the ground beef was much better than other burger joints. The staff, from the hostess to the two waiters we had were so friendly and helpful.  We truly had a great dining experience.  Sadly, we were too full to try the desserts. Oh well...there's always tomorrow."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany G.,"Orlando, FL",7/25/2015,5.0,"I needed a cigarette after that meal, because my world was rocked pretty hard. I had the house bacon burger with bourbon onions, and we went with the duck fries which was 100% worth the upcharge. I have had my fair share of hamburgers in the past, but this was 50 shades of hamburger bliss. The burger was perfectly juicy and the French fries were made in duck fat. I could feel my arteries closing, but I didn't care. I remain the happy captain going down with my ship. To make the evening complete, a bourbon fizz was a refreshing summer drink without losing sight of what bourbon should taste like.Everyone needs to make a hommage to this restaurant at least some point. It's well worth the wait."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Trinity E.,"Knoxville, TN",8/23/2017,5.0,"So good! One of the best burger spots in town. They have a good selection ! Only downfall is it's small space, so if you have to wait for dinner, it's worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Larry H.,"Washington, DC",4/16/2018,5.0,"Stopped in for dinner with my buddy Corey.  I had the Farmhouse burger and he had the Black bean and corn salad along with the Black bean burger.  Both burgers were excellent!  My farmhouse was cooked medium well and I could not have done a better job myself.  We both had the house cut fries and they were cooked perfect.  We may just have another meal here before heading out of town.  They even serve Japanese whiskey!  Our server Josh kept our glasses full, great service definitely recommend this place for great food and service.."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Arthur S.,"Norfolk, VA",10/16/2017,5.0,"Found this gem on Yelp and decided to give it a try on a football weekend in Knoxville.  A word of warning, this place is busy so plan accordingly.  We checked in on the Yelp App and walked over to the restaurant when it was time to check in with the hostess.      The time to show up was right on the money.  Since I had my Greyhound with me we wanted to sit outside and that is what they had for us.  They had water out for the dogs which was great.    Ok, now for the good stuff, the food, bourbon, and beer. My buddy and I ordered The Hurt Locker with fried jalapeños on it.  While that was cooking we had a couple beers and flights of bourbon.  They have a great selection so you will not be disappointed.  My burger was cooked perfectly and I would have to say it was the best burger I have ever had.  All the flavors were perfect and the meat itself was so tender and delicious that it seemed to dissolve in your mouth.  I actually thought about buying a second burger just to take back to Virginia Beach for dinner the next day.  The fries and onion rings were delicious too.     As for the service, we never had a need unfulfilled and the wait staff was pleasant, attentive, and friendly.      Our experience here was top notch and I know I will eat here again when I come back for UT games in the future."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vivienne R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/24/2020,2.0,Someone said they had good burgers.  Guess again.  If you are having a Black and Blue Burger it would be really nice to have blue cheese in it.  Very little blue cheese and way to many fried onion.  Burger was over salted too.  Not impressed and cannot recommend..  the Dunkel beer was good.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Madeleine S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/9/2019,2.0,I ordered a to-go steakhouse burger and asked for it to be medium and it was not. I went back and showed them that picture but they said they could not do anything because I did not have a receipt but I did not receive one when I purchased the burger. Clearly the burger was cooked rare if even that.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley W.,"Durham, NC",4/4/2018,5.0,We were on the highway and looking for something other than fast food... yelp helped! It's more of a pub but the food was amazing. Husband had the traditional American burger w/ onion rings and I had the chicken (clucker?) but substituted avocado for the cheese. That made it messy and a bit heavy/creamy but good. Next time I'd just skip the avocado. The village salad side was great. Seating isn't great but service was!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Laura M.,"Knoxville, TN",8/21/2019,5.0,"This is quite possibly the best burger I've ever had! The meat is juicy and flavorful and their menu items are unique and full of flavor.  Allergy and gluten free friendly with a gluten free bun option and rice flour on hand in case you need your breaded jalapenos breaded in rice flour instead of wheat.  The wait in weekends is usually an hour or longer, but you can join a waiting line via an app to help you out."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tyler B.,"Nashville, TN",4/1/2015,4.0,"My husband and I stopped here for lunch on the way to North Carolina. It was a gorgeous day so we sat outside. My husband had the Farmhouse Burger, and I had the Black Bean and Corn Salad.The salad was delicious and fresh, but way too overdressed. I would recommend asking for the dressing on the side. The restaurant has a lovely ambience inside and out. I love the fact that they have the option for outdoor seating. Our server was attentive and friendly. I would definitely come back when I'm in the area."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Izzat A.,"Falls Church, VA",5/14/2019,4.0,One of the better restaurants in Knoxville imo. Stopped by here for dinner with a friend while in town for work. Ordered the mother clicker and it was very good. The fries that come with it are on point as well. Service was friendly and quick and the prices are very fair. Would definitely return.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Diana B.,"Ambler, PA",5/18/2019,5.0,"Great burger, great beer, great bourbon, great company, great location. What more can you ask for?"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Melissa S.,"Phoenixville, PA",7/6/2017,5.0,"This place was exceptionally good! Their food is unique and locally sourced. The beef comes from Blaine, TN and buns come from Knoxville. My husband and my cousin's fiancé said that these were the best burgers they have ever had! My husband got the Bernie burger (beef patty, blue cheese crumbles, bacon, blueberry preserves, and fried jalapeños) and my cousin's fiancé ordered the Bison burger (bison patty, boursin cheese, mushrooms, crispy onions, and garlic aioli). I ordered the Mother Clucker (chicken breast, bourbon onions, havarti cheese, and garlic aioli). My cousin ordered the Village Tomato Salad (heirloom tomatoes, red onions, banana peppers, feta cheese, olives, basil, and EVOO). Also, their cocktails are excellent! We tried the Old Fashion and Manhattan - both fantastic!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Monica K.,"Pigeon Forge, TN",10/14/2019,5.0,"This is one of my favorite places to eat in town. Anytime friends come to visit, we end up here. The burgers are always delicious and service is always fast and great. I'm a fan of the Farmhouse Burger - the fried egg on top makes it perfect. My entire family loves this place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christina K.,"Seattle, WA",1/12/2018,4.0,"Exceptional service, tasty burgers and cold drinks - what more could you ask for?  I met up with a couple of colleagues for dinner while on a business trip and at 6:30pm on a Wednesday, it was packed!  After getting our food, I could see why with all the options in this area this place was so busy.  All of the food looked amazing and our meals were no exception.  They serve the best French fries and a menu with something for everyone:  one colleague had the Hurt Locker (beef burger), I had the Deadhead (black bean & quinoa burger) and the other colleague had the fried chicken and waffle Burger (the ""buns"" were waffles!).  The portion sizes were perfect and everything was prepared perfectly.  If you want a great burger in Knoxville, stop by for lunch or dinner!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/27/2017,5.0,"Incredible! Best burgers I've ever had -- and I love a good burger. A little pricy, but the quality and variety more than make up for it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelly F.,"Madison, WI",7/25/2015,5.0,"Highly recommend! The ambiance was really cool. The service was great. Drinks we're awesome and the food was delicious!I had the Bison burger and it was AMAZING. The bun was toasted and held up very well with the juiciness of the burger. It was different (in a good way) than your typical burger bun because it was thinner, so the burger and its delicious toppings were not overwhelmed by too much bread. The burger was topped with a variety of mushrooms, crispy onions, creamy Boursin cheese, and garlic aioli. The burger was so juicy and flavorful. The duck confit fries had great flavor and were very good. My only critique is that they were very greasy towards the bottom because all the fat had dripped down. It would be nice if some of that fat was drained off before plating, so the fries at the bottom stay as delicious and crispy as the fries at the top. The sauce for the fries was very good.My husband had the chicken and waffles which was also amazing. The sweetness of the waffle was a great compliment to the savory fried chicken."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lisa M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/24/2017,5.0,Not sure I can add to the rave reviews about the place other than to say that they are accurate. Best Burgers in Knoxville. Delicious Bloody Marys too
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ivy M.,"Auburn, AL",10/7/2018,5.0,"We were told that a table could be up to a 30 minute wait, which was fine considering how small the establishment is. The host also said we could sit immediately at the bar, we decided that was a good option. The bartender was friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable. Despite there being 15 other people at the bar to take care of she did a fabulous job of making us feel welcome. We ordered the Farmhouse burger(breakfast style burger) and the Bacon burger. Both were so fresh, juicy, and very much worth the $10-$14 price tag. We very much enjoyed our visit and will be bringing our family back at a later date!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Adrienne Z.,"Plantation, FL",2/25/2018,5.0,"Love the food! Their homemade cheese is addicting! They are fantastic with combining flavors, like salty with sweet and a little hint of spicy! The cheese dip appetizer is a must! Also if you go there, you must eat a burger! They have other options, but the burgers are delicious! Enjoy!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tracie A.,"Corryton, TN",3/21/2017,5.0,"GREAT-GOOGLY-MOOGLY!I'm a Texas girl, living in this Knoxville world - and Texas will ALWAYS be my home, and Texas will always own my heart.  I cannot tell you how much it pains me to write this, but the burger I had at Stock & Barrel was better than the best burger I have ever had in Texas!  I cannot believe I even wrote down those words... (again, I'm about to die inside for letting anyone know this...)The service we had was great! The hostess was really sweet, and our server was very helpful and attentive... I had The Billy w/onion rings and my daughter had The  Black and Blue w/the fries.  We also had an order of their fried pickles.I had to order the onion rings, because if you beer batter anything - you can color me there!  And these did not disappoint!  The batter was perfect, the onions were tender and sweet - most awesome w/their Ranch dressing - if you get them, ask for RANCH!The Billy Burger - AMAZE-BALLS! as my daughter would say!  The meat was cooked perfectly (medium/rare for me) - crispy edges on the burger...yum... but the combo of the bacon, the sweet tomato jam and the creamy goat cheese - O.M.G!  I want one NOW!I tried my daughter's Black and Blue - it was fantastic, but The Billy was better!  I would though, be happy with either of them.... I liked this place so much, I took my younger daughter there the next day so she could try it.  She's 100% pure TEXAS and doesn't want to admit that she likes anything in Knoxville - but she did say this place was fantastic!  Coming from her, that is a HUGE compliment!The ONLY complaint I could find about this place were the chairs.  They are way too hard... but I can live with that!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tearsa S.,"Knoxville, TN",6/24/2019,5.0,Every single thing on their menu is a win. This is our go to date night spot in Downtown Knoxville. Awesome selection of bourbons/ whiskeys and cocktails.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ce T.,"Texarkana, AR",6/21/2019,5.0,Insanely good.  Oh my!!! I had a hamburger with pimento cheese and a fried tomato.  Delicious!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie W.,"Phoenix, AZ",5/28/2019,2.0,My friends and I visited from Ohio this past weekend and were told to come here for dinner... We ordered the fried feta for an app which was AMAZING. The burgers were offered in a lettuce wrap which was great but I wasn't mind blown. The tomato and feta salad was soaking in oil and my friends fried chicken sandwich was dry. Her tomato and feta salad also had a piece of metal in it and the waitress didn't apologize or offer to bring anything in replace of it. The waitress also gave dirty looks when asking normal questions about sauces offered. I would recommend trying a different place in Market Square for a burger.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Becky B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/7/2017,5.0,So I am not big on burgers but I was recommended to come here and I did... And I have to say it was a good idea. I had the bison burger with duck fries! The nutella milkshake is a must have! Nice decor and atmosphere... A most go if you're in market square area.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley H.,"Phoenix, AZ",9/27/2018,5.0,"Literally the best burger my husband and I have EVER had! The meat by itself was incredible, the seasoning was perfect and the toppings weren't so overwhelming that they just became decoration, they were delicious! The fries are seasoned so simply and so tastefully and the onion rings are cooked to perfection! Most places, the onion comes out of the ring when you bite into to - not here, it's a perfect bite and the crust doesn't fall apart in your hands.I wish we had this restaurant in Phoenix because it it hands down a place I will be craving in the future! Oh, and I should mention the hospitality- our servers name was Casey. He was so incredibly respectful, gave us suggestions that were spot on!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brandon S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/29/2018,5.0,Best burger in Knoxville possibly the whole world !!!!!! And if you aren't too full the s'mores milkshake is off the charts and they even torch the marshmallows on top !!!! Service is always top notch ! If you like to drink whiskey they have a large selection and they make a mean old fashioned !!!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alexa B.,"Midtown, Nashville, TN",11/29/2019,5.0,"One of my favorite places in Knoxville. A delicious burger with amazing fries. We were frustrated by the wait- there was a table ready and waiting, but we weren't seated until 20 minutes later. However, great service and amazing food more than made up for the wait. This restaurant was affordable as well. I'm excited to try their Nashville location as well!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Charles M.,"Las Vegas, NV",3/18/2018,5.0,Generally rated one of the top restaurants in the area for a reason.  Great hamburgers and lots of craft beers.  Plenty of hamburger choices and they are the best burgers in East Tennessee.  The appetizers are excellent and I would highly recommend the mushrooms.  This place is always busy.  So if you show up at a normal meal time expect to wait.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kacy M.,"Knoxville, TN",12/16/2018,5.0,"'Merica Burger and Duck Confit fries for me. Burger was fresh, fries were crispy. If you're into those things- give it a shot."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,SK H.,"Nashville, TN",12/13/2018,5.0,"I travel 13 states regularly and have the opportunity to try a multitude of restaurants and thus is one of my (if not the) most favorite restaurants period (The Bernie).  I've eaten here no less than 10x, service and food has always been consistent - impeccable.  However, last night 12/12/18) we sat at the bar to eat, one of the bartenders was soo poor in terms of service and experience I literally said to the person I was eating with, this may be my last visit here.  Now, here come my next however, the other bartender Jenna SAVED the experience.  She was friendly, knowledgeable, just a true asset to Stock & Barrel.  The engaging environment she created at ""her"" bar with ""her"" customers was world class.  It so nice to see when customer service employees who authentically enjoy interacting with customers, versus the example of the other bartender where customers were simply a nuisance to her."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,SK H.,"Nashville, TN",1/14/2015,5.0,"Wednesday 1/14/2015 @ 1:00pm. Best burger I've had in a long while (The Bernie).  Sat at the bar, the young lady behind bar was great, very attentive and provided good recommendations.  Bourbon selection is world class. I will be back for sure."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Payal P.,"Carrollton, TX",12/9/2018,3.0,"Disclaimer - I am vegetarian and prefer not to eat burgers (even veggie burgers in a restaurant setting) so my review would be biased to what this place has to offer.The mac n cheese had a smoky flavor that I personally wasn't a fan of. I wish it were a little more cheesy. Felt it was a bit dry. Overall okay, but I was disappointed.The black bean and corn salad was good. It was light. Missing a bit of seasoning. Felt it could've had more flavor in terms of spices/seasoning (not salt). Dressing was ok, more oil than herbs.I'd come back to try the crazy milkshakes, but would most likely not eat here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kellie B.,"Moyock, NC",12/7/2018,5.0,A must visit when we come to Knoxville! Love the burgers and the fried pickles!  The billy and the bison are our faves! Typically there is a wait but it's worth it!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jonathan P.,"Knoxville, TN",12/7/2018,5.0,"Great whiskey selection, excellent bison burger and fries! I'm. A big whiskey drinker and like any American, I love my fries. Well, stock and barrel has all of the above; I've gone there on multiple occasions (even prior to me becoming pescatarian). I've tried the veggie burger, mushroom burger, bison burger and traditional burgers throughout my visits and they are always exceptional in taste; great portions and super knowledgeable bartenders, they even introduced me to some new whiskeys that are now amongst my favorite! Definitely must go if in Knoxville"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Meena W.,"Knoxville, TN",12/6/2018,5.0,Truly sensational every time . Worth the time and money. We have never been disappointed or tried anything that wasn't just beyond delicious- both food and drinks! Staff is always courteous and attentive.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany B.,"Augusta, GA",12/4/2018,4.0,We came here pretty late one night and were glad that they did not have a wait. There was a group of about eight of us. Most of us were just having drinks but some ordered some food. I tried the crab dip and that is easily up there for some of the best crab dip I have ever had. I tried a friend's duck confit fries and also thought those were delicious. I tried the s'mores shake that someone else ordered and it was tasty. Would have liked to come back here to try the Nutella one but will add it to my list to come back to when I am in town!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gabe G.,"Jurupa Valley, CA",11/13/2018,5.0,"A must have when in Knoxville. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I wasn't a fan of the duck confit fries but my coworker enjoyed them, the onion rings were perfect in every way, service was fast and friendly. You'll probably have to wait as the restaurant is small and busy, but worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah D.,"Philadelphia, PA",11/9/2018,5.0,"My absolute FAVORITE burger place in Knoxville and one of my favorite restaurants. If you're not a Knoxville native and looking for a good place to eat, definitely check this place out. You won't be disappointed."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/9/2018,2.0,"I send all my out of town business visitors to the Stock & Barrel because it is phenomenal but I've never had an experience personally like I did Wednesday.  I had a large group that I was taking out and showed up at 5 pm to get a table and a few drinks while waiting for them.  I was told that a single person couldn't be seated at a large table without half of the group present.  When I pointed out that the largest table in the room had exactly that, I was told he seated himself and there was nothing that could be done.  When half my group appeared I was told we would have a long wait (no time specified) but we could sit outside in 55 degree weather with winds under 1 heat lamp.  When I asked if we could put the outside tables together so we could eat together, I was told they never had arranged them such.  When I asked if we could be seated at the low tables inside in batches as they opened up, I was told that we couldn't do that because although we'd been waiting an hour, we weren't on the small table list and they just couldn't do it.  So I took my 14 visitors to Babalu's where I will no be sending my business visitors.  No matter what solution I tried to offer, it couldn't be done.  This makes me sad because Stock & Barrel has always been a personal favorite."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/10/2015,5.0,"Love this place.  We had the fried green tomatoes and a couple burgers.  The tomatoes were off the chart and we both loved the burgers...juicy, flavorful, yum!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rick E.,"Franklin, TN",7/8/2019,2.0,Had the worst hamburger I can remember...dry and tasteless.  Asked for a frozen margarita and they don't have those.  Asked if they had a strawberry margarita and they don't have those.  This is a bar and grill folks that seems to serve a very limited number of drinks.  Fries were good bu the rest was a bit lacking.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bobby N.,"Knoxville, TN",5/30/2019,5.0,Simply the best burgers anywhere. I order the farmhouse every time because there is just nothing as flavorful out there.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Isaiah C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/1/2018,5.0,Best burger in Knoxville. Hands downI would do bad things for the bacon burger and onion rings
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Pegan S.,"Brentwood, TN",4/27/2018,5.0,Never disappointed here! Even the onion rings are PERFECT. An amazing selection of whiskeys and great hand crafted burgers.  SO good!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Keely M.,"St. Petersburg, FL",11/27/2017,5.0,"Favorite restaurant in Knoxville! I'm rarely in Knox, but Stock & Barrel is an absolute must for me every time I come. There's usually a wait unless you go at an off time but you can check in online and kill time in Market Square, no problem. And, YES, the wait is worth it! I usually get the Hurt Locker. HUGE burger and LOTS of fries. Some patio seating is awesome when the weather is nice. Indoor is a long skinny dining room with a great atmosphere. Usually fairly loud, but super comfortable. Highly, highly recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paul C.,"Charlotte, NC",1/2/2015,5.0,"Paul's Yelp Elite Review Rating: 4.75 rounded UP to 5 Stars!Me and my best friends Steve and Dean came back here to stock and barrel for lunch because it is extremely difficult to get into this restaurant at dinner since it is so small. It only has 7 tables and about 15 seats at the bar area so it is quite compact, so be expected to wait long hours or come back at lunch time like we did especially during the week. Obviously the reason to come to this place is for their burgers. And let me tell you they do their burgers absolutely right at this place! We all got different burgers but I had the Farmhouse burger, which had a succulent egg on top, applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, onions tomatoes and I added extra mushrooms. We were told that the beef is sourced locally and also most of the vegetables are local as is the cheese, and the bun is made in Knoxville. My God was this burger sloppy, just the way I love it and as it should be! I got my burger medium with just a dab of red in the middle. The meat was perfectly seasoned and all the ingredients worked extremely well together. The piece de resistance was the hand cut fries which were fried in duck fat! Yes, duck fat! Their burgers usually come with their hand cut fries, but for an extra two bucks, definitely upgrade to the duck fat fries!Since the three of us are pretty big eaters I also ordered their beer battered onion rings, and these were some of the best onion rings I have had in a very long time! The batter was light and fluffy and the onions were obviously sweet and the flavor was just excellent. Even though it was lunchtime, this place is a whiskey bar, so I felt I had to ""take one"" for the Yelp Elite Team  and try a flight of their whiskeys! If you take a look at one of the photos I posted there's a list of the whiskey's offered from inexpensive to outrageous! They have a very rare Kentucky Bourbon that they pay almost a thousand dollars a bottle for, and for $100 you too could have a shot. That's a little rich for my blood, being the wineo that I am, so I opted for a $16 ""Stock and Barrel"" bourbon flight. I thought this to be a really good deal given the quality of the Bourbons they poured. Each was about three quarter of an ounce which actually is a fairly generous poor for what you're getting. Keep in mind that these are distilled spirits so its quite potent! Our bartender, Ben, was super as he was a younger guy who obviously was schooled in the wonders of bourbon. And he helps guide me through my selection.I just wish this place was a little bit larger to accommodate the obviously overwhelming demand that they are experiencing here in Knoxville. They really need to open another location especially out in West Knoxville.bIt of course would be awesome to come out to Charlotte North Carolina where I live as we would eat this place up!Highly, highly recommended!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,E. P.,"Knoxville, TN",12/22/2017,5.0,"This is probably my favorite burger place in Knoxville. They have been in business for more than  three years and without fail their food is consistently great. They have a wonderful selection of whiskeys and beer. All of ingredients are local and burgers are done to order and the right temperature right in the heart of K'town. If you are a burger lover, it can't be a better place to satisfy you burger crave. Also, give yourself a treat and get the onion rings, the duck confit fries or a combination of both (which I recently discovered they can do!)Despite what Yelp info section might say, they are child friendly. Also, beware of the waiting time. It's a small dining room and being in Market Square makes it more prompt to long waiting times, however, if you have apps like Nowait, they could notify you when your table is ready while you check out the store in the Square..."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kayla M.,"Laurel, DE",8/30/2020,5.0,"Super juicy burgers and crazy good fries to go with. Small space but nice, friendly service. I'm from Delaware and I'll definitely be back soon"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chelsea W.,"Brevard, NC",8/15/2018,5.0,We were passing through Knoxville on a road trip and we stopped here hoping for good burgers. They were absolutely amazing. We were told we had to wait for a table and then was seated right away. Great service and great food. I was pleasantly surprised and left feeling so fat.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alex S.,"Pilot Mountain, NC",6/24/2020,2.0,"I'm sure you could find something decent here but it was less than subpar for me. First of all it was FREEZING inside, the salmon was disgusting, and the burger my boyfriend got was so bad we both got sick from trying it. Nobody finished all their food without being grossed out. Super overhyped and too expensive. Not worth it!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Patrick P.,"Wallkill, NY",4/8/2018,4.0,"Pretty stinking delicious. My husband got the Bernie and it was amazing! I got the black and blue burger. Didn't really taste much of the blue cheese. I had the gluten free bun and although delicious, was difficult to eat because it was crumbly like a biscuit. Ended up eating my burger with a fork and knife."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chris A.,"Greenville, SC",8/20/2017,4.0,Had scoped the place on a previous trip to Knoxville but it was early and not open.  Neat divey spot in a very public space at the Market Square. Food menu is surprisingly eclectic and it just feels like a neat spot to be.  Would definitely hit this back up on the next ride in to town.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Camy C.,"Derby, CT",3/9/2015,4.0,"Came to Knoxville for work meeting and after the plane ride, we wanted to stretch our legs so walked over here from the Hilton hotel (~5 min).  Got the THE HURT LOCKER burger $12 - which includes Pimiento Cheese, Benton's Bacon, Fried Green Tomatoes, Bourbon Onion.on the menu it was stated. ""Our Beef Comes from Locally Sourced Mitchell Family Farms in Blaine, Tn. It Is All-Natural, Pasture Fed, and Hormone Free. Burgers Are Cooked Medium to Medium Well and Juicy Every Time. We Serve Our Burgers on a Specialty Flour Dusted Bun from Flour Head Bakery in Knoxville, Tn. Served With Hand Cut French Fries. Gluten Free Bun Available Upon Request."". The bun complemented the burger very well. It was delicious. The bourbon onion was caramelized and super soft.. the fried green tomato was like a solid piece of onion ring.. soft, not too squishy or too juicy. No lettuce tho but I didn't really miss it. The burger was nice and super juicy! Also got the duck confit fries instead of regular fries. As an app, it's $7 by itself. There was an +$2 charge but so worth it.  Hand Cut Fries, Grated Parmesan, Sea Salt, Smoked Garlic Aioli. The aioli... delicious!!  I was very full from the burger itself but I got the fries to go b/c it was that good! We sat outside but the waiter was quite attentive and saw my colleague had finished his beer so came out to ask if he needed another. The square was pretty empty but it was nice to be outdoors after a long harsh winter filled with snow. No wait but it was also 2:30pm on a Monday."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Francois Paul T.,"Nashville, TN",9/29/2017,4.0,"Great burger restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. The restaurant itself is pretty cozy. I love the Einstein lightbulbs. It's a small place. So it was pretty full even for lunch time!I ordered a bacon burger and a Nutella shake. The burger was super gourmet, the goat cheese created this incredibly flavorful burger with an amazing taste profile. The Nutella shake was a true rockstar it was actually amazing. Would go to the place for only that.Would go again. Pretty good food!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Eka M.,"San Antonio, TX",9/20/2017,3.0,"The burger was cooked to order (medium rare) but I've had juicier and more flavorful patties, hence the 3 star - it was just OK. They're creative with their burger creation - I had the Bernie which comes with Bleu cheese, fried jalapeno and blueberry jam that together taste delicious (who knew?!) I highly recommend to get their onion rings as a side. It was fresh, hot, crunchy and flavorful - I'd come back for this. The service was average. I'd give them another try if I'm craving burger next time I'm in town."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather P.,"Bury St Edmunds, United Kingdom",8/19/2017,5.0,"The Opa appetizer (fried feta with honey), duck confit fries, and hurt locker burger all made for a great afternoon pick me up. They have a good beer selection, and lively but not loud ambiance. My only buyers beware is for any foodies who see ""duck confit"" expecting pulled, tender duck -- it has no duck, but is simply tossed in duck fat."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Samuel B.,"Knoxville, TN",11/19/2016,4.0,"""One of the best burgers....ever""I have had burgers all over the city of Knoxville and Stock n Barrel definitely ""brings home the beef""! I've had the farmhouse and it is out of this world good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeff E.,"West Lafayette, IN",1/8/2015,5.0,"Wait, I haven't written a review of Stock and Barrel?  I seriously thought I had.It's an extremely good burger.  They know what they're doing.  There are the other things like fried pickles and duck fat fries and a seriously good onion ring.  The milkshakes are worth saving room to have - split your burger if you must.  And a note: the people in the back are worth trusting.  Whatever the special is that day, that's your best bet.Then there's the bourbon.  It's wonderful, like Charlie entering the flipping Chocolate Factory.  I honestly do not understand people who come to this place, buy a beer, and leave.  It's like going to Costco and not leaving with 100 of something.  WHY.  I have a few wishes for their selection, though.  I wish they kept Pappy on hand, for no other reason than it's a necessity for a place that has a bona fide bourbon bar.    I wish you could build your own flight.  I'd pay $10 over the price of the highest-priced flight to put my own together (even pay a little extra for the bottles you have to climb up to get).  And I really, really REALLY wish they'd cook more with bourbon.  There's almost nothing on the menu prepared with bourbon.  Please?One last thing I'd suggest is to check in whenever you can to see if they're making the egg nog.  That stuff is amazing.  Try a little of everything and go back often.  This is the best place on Market Square."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jamie D.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",8/9/2019,3.0,So I'm new to Knoxville and everyone I talked to recommended stock and barrel. Took my Fiancé to lunch there. Ordered the farm house burger and duck fat fires with a beer. The duck fat fires were amazing best thing ever get them if you go. Beer was also good. My complaint was with the burger it was cooked to my liking fried egg was warm and runny. The burger patty was bland. Bland to the point that the flavor over powered everything else on the burger. It didn't taste like the meat was seasoned at all. My fiancé said the same about her burger as well. All in all the was a good experience. Our waitress was fast and attentive. Everything else was great but for the money throw some seasoning on that meat.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike F.,"Charleston, SC",8/24/2017,5.0,Absolutely fantastic from the moment we walked in thru the whole meal. Hosted greeted me and a buddy. We needed seeing two open bar seats. Two great female bartenders were attentive and on top of it. Smiled and always asked us how we were doing. Huge bourbon selection with a rustic bar feel. Perfect Knoxville down south reclaimed spot. Burger selection is great. I had the Bison burger with duck fat fries. Both burgers were cooked to perfection and came out in 10 min or less. Decent prices for great food. Recommend this place for everyone. Please go in. I'm from Charleston SC which has a great food and bar scene and Stock and Barrel would be a perfect fit there as well. It will not disappoint
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jack L.,"Greenville, SC",6/27/2017,3.0,"I am staying in downtown Knoxville so I have plenty of places within walking distance to eat. Not sure why, but I decided to go with Stock and Barrel. Maybe I was subconsciously craving a burger. Maybe I was subconsciously thinking of taking a stock and barrel to someone's head: who knows? I took the 10 minute walk here and settled up at the bar. I got a Sculpin IPA to drink, solid selection. I decided on the Farmhouse Burger because I am a sucker for eggs on just about anything. I was a little disappointed in the burger. Actually, quite disappointed. The burger was cooked a perfect medium, but it was salty and lacked real flavor. It had plenty of fat cause it was all over my basket (One thing that perturbs me more than just about anything is the use of baskets for serving food. Use a plate you idiots!!! I don't need the edges and sides of a basket interfering in my attempt to use silverware!! Ahhhh!). The egg was also cooked properly but I was served one, tiny, measly little piece of bacon. Where's the beef? Give me more than two bites of bacon for $12.5! The fries were really good as well. In retrospect, almost everything was really good except I got robbed of my bacon. Don't advertise bacon on a burger and give me less than anyone else in history. Meh."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nathan W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/6/2019,5.0,I love this place - some of the best burgers in Knoxville.  Look forward every time I go
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Anne P.,"Royal Oak, MI",4/5/2019,4.0,Stopped here for lunch while walking through Market Square. Burger was delicious and HUGE. Dark atmosphere but fun place. Wait staff exceptional.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Scott L.,"Atlanta, GA",1/23/2017,4.0,"Great. Great and good.  Burger great. Fries great. Beer selection only good. The place was super busy and had a long wait. But luckily I was alone and was able to nab a seat at the bar immediately. I have little or no complaint on what I ordered. Cooked to perfection and a good flavor, I would say get the burger.  Hand cut fresh fries you can never go wrong with. I only wish they had a deeper beer selection-being a beer snob had its limitations. I believe their brown liquor selection is far better and more of their focus."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Beth V.,"Atlanta, GA",11/12/2016,1.0,"It is a rare and infuriating experience to be lied to, to your face. And yet, the hostess at Stock and Barrel admitted that they are ""only allowed to tell customers that the wait is about two hours,"" regardless of how long the wait actually is. When I got to the host stand at 4:30 PM this Saturday night, I got a party of 5 on the list and was told that the wait would be ""about two hours."" At 5:00, my husband double checked with the host and was told that the wait would be ""about two hours."" We went to Downtown Bar and Grill and came back to Stock and Barrel at 6:30 PM, only to be told that the wait would be another hour. At this point, the hostess then on duty told us that they are supposed to tell people the wait is only about two hours, regardless of how long the wait may actually be.Being suckers, we believed the hostess when she said that one more hour should be enough, so we left and came back, one to be told that it would be at least another hour more.If we had been told at 4:30 that the wait was four hours, we could have planned ahead, eaten heavy appetizers elsewhere to tide us over, and come back to Stock and Barrel around 8:30 for a late dinner. Instead, we were lied to intentionally at least once, if not two to three times, and are now back at the Brewery eating dinner.I do not take a negative review here lightly, but this level of poor customer service is unconscionable. We live in Atlanta but are from Tennessee and visit Knoxville frequently. We were hosting friends who live in Maryland this weekend and were embarrassed to be lied to and treated this way by a restaurant that we used to love.I would encourage anyone who has a choice to NOT patronize Stock and Barrel.Based on their behavior tonight, I can only conclude that they think very little of their customers and potential customers."

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Conni B.,"Dyer, IN",11/30/2017,5.0,"Wow. Visiting from Chicago and used Yelp to find this gem. Everything was AMAZING. The drink selection was huge and my Manhattan one of the best I have ever had. We did slpits on the chicken and waffles and the ring of fire burger. We both LOVED every single bite. A fun, funky vibe and food to die for. Would go back in a second."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michele H.,"Orlando, FL",4/21/2019,5.0,"The best burgers we've ever had! Get the one with blueberries. I know it sounds weird but try it, delish!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jaime H.,"Charlotte, NC",5/10/2017,5.0,OMG BEST BURGERS EVER!!!!The seating is tight I mean so close you can hear the table what seems like 20 inches away talking to one another.  Too close for me. But the burgers....they are the best I have ever had. I ordered the shrooms burger and it had a tiny hint of horseradish. I dont like is but it added flavor in just the most subtle way. It has tons of shrooms on it. Yummy!Amazing food!!! This was worth the 50 min drive from Pigeon Forge!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Court N.,"Lexington, KY",7/24/2019,4.0,Really great burgers. Narrow restaurant but has a good patio. Highly recommend the fried pickles and mushroom burger! My only drawback was on the mushroom burger it said there was a diverse type of mushroom but I only got a few in my burger and they were just white button ones. They brought more out and made sure there was a mix in there
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Diane O.,"Chattanooga, TN",10/3/2017,5.0,"Wow! We travel for work. We've eaten in everything from top restaurants to dives in all 48 contiguous states and Hawaii. We have to say, with absolutely no question in our minds that this is absolutely the best burger place we've ever been to.We started with the Duck Confit Fries. Very very good. Be sure to ask for extra BBQ Ranch. It's a great combination.For our entree, I ordered the Hurt Locker and my husband had the Black & Blue. Both were great, but seriously the Hurt Locker will be in my dreams. I'm sure to be craving another one soon. It's one of those burgers you could eat almost everyday. I seriously considered ordering another one to go for snacking later. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The Bourbon Onions, Pimiento Cheese, Fried Green Tomato and Benton's Bacon on top on the perfectly cooked patty... just WOW. The buns are from a local bakery and just the perfect compliment.If you haven't tried this place, then hurry up amd get there. If it's busy and you have to wait, then do it. It's absolutely worth it. We will definitely be regulars as we live in Knoxville. This will he the place we can't wait to get home to and will love bringing guests to.By the way, fantastic service, awesome decor and atmosphere and you won't find a more fun location."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Philbert W.,"Livermore, CA",8/5/2017,4.0,"Ordered a Farmhouse burger and had planned to order the duck confit fries as an appetizer, but our server told us that we could upgrade the fries that came with our burger for only $2 more.  Sold!The duck fat fries are the bomb.  Super flavorful, perfectly seasoned and crisp.  It would be worth coming here just for those.  The burger was also delicious.  Juicy and flavorful.  The runny fried egg was perfect.  Oh, it was super messy.  Could definitely use more napkins.The service was a little uneven for us, but the food and the restaurant itself are great.  Will come back here the next time I'm in town."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vania L.,"Clearwater, FL",12/27/2016,5.0,"First place I've ever been to that can cook 4 burgers made to order at the desired temperature correctly. Burgers were cooked to perfection and were juicy. We had the Goat cheese burger and although I love goat cheese in my opinion there was too much and was over powering. As a side we had onion rings and those were delicious! Additionally, we requested a garlic aioli with it and that was the perfect dipping side. I enjoyed the bean and corn salad, delicious and so hearty (great portion) with fresh toppings that compliment each other. As beverages my wife enjoyed a beer and I had a bourbon cocktail with muddled strawberries and mint. I think it was too much strawberry... so much i couldn't use a straw. These are small personal opinions but the service was great and the quality was excellent. Would return if I lived near."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Greg K.,"Mobile, AL",4/13/2019,5.0,"I'm pretty picky with good burgers for whatever reason. But, I am truly amazed by Stock & Barrel, by far the best burger I've ever had. Everything was fresh and crispy. Well done!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jenna W.,"Memphis, TN",5/15/2019,5.0,"This was first time at Stock & Barrel. After reading the reviews, I ordered the Bison burger with duck fries and let me tell you, they both were as good or better than the reviews. My husband had the hurt locker and loved it as well! This really could've been the best burger I've ever had and the duck fries were insanely delicious....we will be back! Worth every penny."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jenn A.,"Murfreesboro, TN",5/15/2019,3.0,As stated 100 times before this place is super small. Food came in large portions. Good not great.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Pegan S.,"Brentwood, TN",9/17/2017,5.0,"LOVE this place.  Fun place, not pretentious, and the BEST burgers.  We live Burger Republic in Nashville & this is better!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vanessa N.,"Norcross, GA",5/8/2017,5.0,"Best burgers in town. That's all there is to it. I always get a different burger each time I'm here, and I have yet to be disappointed. Getting the duck confit fries instead of the regular ones are so worth the extra $2. Don't forget to pair your burger with a bourbon."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shelda B.,"Covington, VA",5/20/2018,4.0,"If you've never had duck fat fries, you're missing out.....insanely delicious. The burgers here are creatively designed and a work of art. I enjoyed the outdoor dining, because we could bring Chester, the dog. Very friendly service and great location."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mengya L.,"Knoxville, TN",5/7/2017,5.0,"Wanna go there last night but was told will be waitin  for 1.5hrs!!! Gave up but tried again for lunch today, luckily we got nice seats at the bar. The duck confit fries are the BEST fries I've ever had!!!!! The s'mores milkshake is also amazing! Finally after milkshake and whole basket of fries, I'm so proud I still finished my huge delicious burger! Yum yum yum!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Whitney C.,"San Francisco, CA",8/26/2020,3.0,"We have not been here for a while since we had an issue with our server last time. We requested they not put in our food order until we were done with our appetizer, which just resulted in an ice cold burger while we were still eating our apps. Once the manager stepped in everything was great! Just a little hesitant to spend the money for just okay service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kathryn H.,"Rochester, NY",12/28/2018,5.0,Excellent veggie burger! They do takeout fast and it's just as delicious. This is a good option because they are usually packed! Also my husband loves going there to try new whiskeys.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Beth S.,"Atlanta, GA",2/25/2019,4.0,"Great meal while visiting UTK and a great way to get a feel for the town. We got the wedge salad, perfectly crisp lettuce with tangy blue cheese, dressed to perfection. We also got the chicken sandwich, along with a side of Mac cheese. It's Sony, which I didn't care for but my daughter loved. The staff was friendly and helpful. We reserved our table on yelp, and it was ready at the late end of the range given. Seating may also be at a community table, which we didn't mind. Great shopping in the area makes the wait time fly by."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Aubrey M.,"Gainesville, FL",2/3/2017,5.0,"Good Lord, that was a tasty meal! This is literally as good as it gets.I give Stock & Barrel 5 stars. The service was great, and the food was seriously excellent. I highly recommend the Hurt Locker. I love a good burger and eat at high end burger joints a few times each year, and this was literally the best burger I've ever had. Thick, perfectly cooked bacon. SPICY pimento cheese spread. A perfectly cooked fried green tomato. Slightly sweet bourbon onions. The perfect bun. It was seriously a taste explosion. While I normally go for fries over an onion ring, their onion rings were perfection. Very kid friendly, too. Waiter happily brought us a high chair, the natural noise level of the place meant that the kids didn't have to whisper, and they had a kid's menu (not shown online) with several options-- they even offered to make the kids a pb&j if they didn't want a burger or pasta or grilled cheese. For vegetarians, you can get ANY of their burger options meatless (with the quinoa burger instead). So it's a great choice for the vegetarians, too.Definitely one of my top 3 favorite places so far in Knox. Parking is currently free evenings and all day weekends in the garage directly behind it, so don't let parking deter you from one of the best places in town."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Aaron C.,"Chattanooga, TN",12/29/2017,5.0,The best burger out there. In the whole world. Combine with a good sazerac and you're in business.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alexandr S.,"Oak Ridge, TN",5/5/2017,3.0,This place used to be really good and fast when it opened. But lately the service and food has gotten worse. Also they don't have any healthy options for vegetarians/vegans.But if you want a burger in market square I would go here.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Todd B.,"Manhattan, KS",1/2/2015,5.0,"Awesome fried pickles. They used mildly sweet pickles instead of dill pickles like most places. I liked all of the different meat options available for the burger. (Bison, turkey, chicken) I ended up having the Elk burger that was on special."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Wendy H.,"Knoxville, TN",5/1/2017,4.0,"I don't venture downtown much, but was in area for business in late afternoon and had heard about the great burgers. I gave the Elvis (or, similar name) a try. It was quite good and ample for the price. The fries were also a large serving, however a bit lukewarm and dry.Would go again and give another try for certain.Unfortunately, like many restaurants, this one thinks that a sole woman enjoys being seated next to a table full of children despite it being obvious that she is there for solitude (read, book in hand); so I had Romper Room next me at 2 in the afternoon."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Marco F.,"Charlotte, NC",10/20/2014,4.0,"We came to Knoxville for the weekend to meet up with some family who would be in town. Prior to coming, we asked our fried who had lived in Knoxville for a good place to eat and he mentioned Stock & Barrel along with a few other places we should try.We didn't really put much thought into it. We were actually just walking through market square which came as a recommendation as well. Off in the distance we saw some people sitting outside a small little shop eating HUGE Sandwiches. As we walked closer, we realized they were these massive juicy burgers. We looked up to see what the place was called and to our surprise there it was: ""Stock & Burrell"". As the 4 of us stood there drooling, we all agreed that we would go there for lunch once we were done with the market. Upon arrival, we were greeted right away and taken to our table.Service:The staff was very friendly. The server we got was ""blah"" but that happens anywhere. He seemed very shy and we could barely hear him speak. But in his defense it was a little loud by where we were sitting. (-1 star for our server and being seated in the far back corner right by the kitchen, very noisy)Space:The décor is unique. You get this old rustic vibe. They have a nice bar with seating.Food:An extensive menu of burgers not just with ground beef (lamb chicken fish) that come with delicious bread. The French fries are delicious! We each had a different type of burger. They all looked delicious and everyone was very content with their meal. My girlfriend even said that it was the best burger she ever had!Bourbon: OMG! If you love bourbon, this place will not disapoint. They must have over 125 options to choose from. It's absolutely incredible.If you are looking for a good meal, please go to this place. You will not regret it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bhavin P.,"Miami Beach, FL",12/16/2017,4.0,"Visiting from out of town, this was one of the most recommended food spots in town and it did not disappoint! The atmosphere was very welcoming and the bourbon selection was out of this world. Grabbing a seat at the bar my friend and I were greeted and served immediately by the friendly bartenders. The ""Merican"" burger was simple and delicious. The mac and cheese could have been a little creamier but other than that the food was great! The location at the heart of Market Square is perfect for someone who wants to pop in to eat and explore the local area!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jan P.,"Oakdale, CA",3/21/2019,4.0,We came here while in Knoxville for the Bassmaster Classic. Onion rings were some of the best. Burger was good. Close quarters inside and parking is a pain. Used the parking garage. Service was decent. We'd probably try again if in town.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Deb P.,"Nashville, TN",3/20/2019,5.0,"Amazing food and OUTSTANDING service! We needed to grab a bite to eat and chose a place near our hotel. Wow, did we make the right decision! Chelsea was fantastic! She suggested the ""Bernie"" and it was so delicious! I also had the side of tomato salad, which was bright and tasty. Everything was so nice, especially eating in the courtyard and watching people go by. Thank you, Chelsea, for an unforgettable experience!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lindy P.,"Denver, CO",11/19/2014,5.0,"If you're searching for the best burger in Knoxville, look no further.... Stock & Barrel won't let you down.  Since it's in the busy Market Square, be prepared to wait for a table.  The dining room isn't big, though they do have about 10 seats at the bar and a large community table that could accommodate maybe 14-16 people.  The decor is very industrial with a lot of wood, metal, and exposed brick.  The service was top notch, and the host even takes your number and will text you when your table is ready.  They have about 8 craft brews (a few locals), but there specialty is bourbon.... and lots of it.  They offer 4 different flights of bourbon for your sampling, and they have probably 50+ otherwise.  We started with fried pickles, which you can never go wrong with.  I ordered the classic bacon burger cooked rare with a side of fries, and the burger was cooked perfect!  The meat was very well seasoned and the bun was very fresh.  This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Knoxville, so I hope you can share the same experiences I've had!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dawn C.,"Kingsport, TN",4/26/2019,5.0,"We travel to Knoxville every 3 weeks for my husbands treatment at the UT Medical Center. Without a doubt, this is by far our favorite place to eat. The grass-fed beef and locally sourced produce are amazing. The staff is awesome and very knowledgeable. Definitely worth trying. You'll be hooked just like us!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Elisabeth B.,"Livermore, CA",12/15/2014,4.0,"On a long drive home this was a welcome stop. Located in a paved pedestrian area we found free15 minute street parking.While we called in a to-go order from the highway we still had to wait and additional 20 minutes at the bar above our quoted time. Super happy we didn't get a parking ticket with our to-go order.That was soon forgotten once we received our orders. We tried the Elvis with peanut butter and banana and a grilled chicken option. I usually consider grilled chicken a cop out order but I was looking for something healthy...and dang that was a good sandwich. My boyfriend has downed his burger before I was done with my side. Their buns are the reason I would come back- fresh baked, soft and make the carbs oh so worth it.Meats are free-range, happy proteins and for a small up-charge you can change your side.  Next time we are passing through this will make the must stop list again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Steven B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/23/2019,5.0,"Love the burger options! Classic as well as exotic flavor combinations, perfectly cooked every time. Ask for the adult version milkshakes. Wait times can be long but there's plenty nearby to check out while you wait."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tony W.,"Dover, AR",10/15/2019,5.0,"Stopped in to eat on a Sunday night when passing through. Found the place on Yelp. Service was outstanding, food was Phenomenal, and prices were comparable. I would love to stop in again if I'm ever passing through Knoxville. Only downside is the parking can be difficult depending on when you want to be there. Otherwise I give it 5/5 stars."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Silece M.,"Knoxville, TN",2/2/2019,5.0,"Its a bar, ibwasnt expecting it to be, but the wild game burgers we got were amazing! The place was packed so,its easier to call in for a to go order"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jenny E.,"Knoxville, TN",6/19/2019,5.0,A great hamburger and drink spot. The waiters are good. The bar is extensive. It is crowded all. the. time!!  Everyone else must agree with me.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jordan R.,"Knoxville, TN",6/14/2019,5.0,Amazing service! Hosts Georgia and Mary Beth helped us SO MUCH! We're a bunch of interns out having a good time and they made our experience at The Stock & Barrel one to remember! Thank you Georgia and Mary Beth!:)
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Allyson D.,"Charlotte, NC",10/23/2014,4.0,"I traveled to Knoxville for the weekend and was informed by a few people to try this place. It's located in the Market Square, which is a super cute shopping and restaurant area. The restaurant has an awesome bourbon bar wall. I thought it was cool to see all of the variety of bottles. The bar lights are very unique.Our server was just a 2. He did refill our glasses numerous times without being asked, however his energy towards us was very low. I got the bacon cheeseburger with fries and it was amazing! It was a very good burger size and topped with house pickles! The burger was cooked just how I asked and everything was just oozing out with every bite! I'm not usually a burger girl, but since I knew this place is known for their amazing burgers and they use grass fed beef (I believe somewhat local), I agreed to go big! I will definitely recommend this place to people and would return if I am ever in the area again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jim H.,"Bettendorf, IA",1/18/2019,4.0,The hamburgers exceeded expectations - great flavor built on excellent beef. The French fries were tasty but I prefer double cooked to make them much more crisp.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachael A.,"East Knoxville, Knoxville, TN",6/9/2020,5.0,Hands down the best burger downtown. I love the Shroomin burger. The staff are friendly and efficient.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Maura A.,"Greenville, SC",7/16/2016,5.0,"Stock & Barrel is my kind of place. I always appreciate a restaurant that can do a burger, and make it a special experience. I had the spicy crab dip appetizer to start. It came out fast and had baked pita chips to dip in it. That started things off well. Next, the burger. I had the Billy-a simple masterpiece of meat, bacon, bourbon grilled onions, and tomato jam. I ordered it medium rare, and it came out pink and juicy and just perfect. That burger paired with the duck fat fries (and whatever dipping sauce they come with) was simply amazing. Just go here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Courtney C.,"Nashville, TN",6/7/2020,1.0,"Maybe dine in is ok but takeout was pretty awful. Be aware of the ""avocado"" which is squished out of a bag along with other nasty preservatives."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jayda B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/7/2020,5.0,"My fiancée and I eat here all the time! It's the best burger place in Knoxville. Stock & Barrel will always have our business, and our appetites lol."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jared W.,"Knoxville, TN",9/19/2016,3.0,"This particular little spot is a burger and whiskey joint. The atmosphere is very lax and enjoyable. Whether you go for the many wonderful burgers or the vast selection of whiskey, you won't be dissapointed with the relaxing and very easy-going dining experience. The only thing keeping me from rating the Stock and Barrel higher is that I wish the place was a little bigger to accommodate a larger crowd. There are occasions I've been where I had to wait for seating and with a bigger dining room this problem would be fixed. I consider myself an experienced burger conisour and the regular burger is very acceptable but when you go I would suggest trying something new. Something new is what Stock and Barrel does well with many takes on the burger. Stock and Barrell can put just about anything on their very tasty buns with a side of hand made fries, which are addictive. Another reason I rated the Stock and Barrell a three star instead of four is the simple fact that the dinner  menu, I feel, needs to be more diversified with items that aren't just burgers. If Stock and Barrell could add more items than burgers to their menu, and cook those items well, then I would have no problem kicking up my score a notch; but I have to be honest and for now this spot in Market Square is a solid 3 star locale."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Somin L.,"Seattle, WA",5/28/2017,5.0,"Super delicious burgers, great vibes, and AMAZINGLY GOOD FRIES (they come with the burger!!!). Great location in downtown Knoxville as well. They don't have a huge draft beer selection, but they do have a huge whiskey selection if you're into that. Wish they had slider options so I can try all of the burger flavors!!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shirley F.,"Sevierville, TN",1/31/2019,4.0,"Great burgers. A little cramped, but has a great atmosphere. Recommend you check in on yelp before heading over."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kyle P.,"Lancaster, CA",8/27/2016,5.0,"Best burger in Knoxville, with great service and affordable prices. The burger was thick, very juicy and as fresh as any I've ever had. Even the buns were remarkable. The hand cut fries were the perfect complement."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Doug Y.,"Lancaster, NY",9/18/2016,4.0,"I can't comment on the food because I only had drinks here,  but their selection of whiskey's was amazing.  They handed me a 8-1/2 x 11 sized whiskey which included flights of whiskeys and bourbons.  The bartender then helped us select a whiskey to try based on those that we already like.  Nice staff,  and a nice looking establishment, but not very big.  It is long but fairly narrow and not many tables."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Elysia C.,"Jacksonville, FL",8/10/2016,5.0,"We've dined here several times when visiting our daughter at college. They have a huge menu of whiskey, bourbon etc as well as 4 or 5 good beers on draft. I ordered the Belle Meade on the rocks and my husband ordered Powers on the rocks. Both were delicious. I also had a Guinness. Food: Delicious!!!We like the fried pickles (they are a little sweet which caught me off guard the first time)Love the Farmhouse burger, Blue cheese and basic bacon and cheese. These burgers are huge and fries are fresh cut fries. Service is always excellent."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Calleigh W.,"Dayton, OH",5/27/2019,5.0,I had the mother clucker grilled chicken sandwich and a fried pickle appetizer and it was all so good! Everything tasted delicious and the price was reasonable considering how huge their burgers are. Most burgers are around $10. I recommend cutting it in half and sharing it or taking the other half to go. They give you a ton of fried pickles (which is awesome). It is very loud in there but that is because it's also a bar. They have a little patio area to eat out front if you don't want too much noise. Wait times are very long but worth it so consider calling an hour ahead.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Olga N.,"Knoxville, TN",6/23/2016,4.0,"It finally happened, guys.  I had a stellar experience at Stock & Barrel.  Woo!  We were seated promptly.  Service was on point.  The stars aligned.  The angels wept.  I had the Hurt Locker, and we shared the White Cheddar Pimiento Cheese with Pita Chips.  The pimiento dip was shamefully addictive, and my burger was delicious, cooked to a perfect medium.  I forget my server's name, but he was knowledgeable and perfectly attentive.  Thank you, S&B.  I know your quality has never been lacking, but this is the first time you genuinely wooed me.  Much obliged."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Olga N.,"Knoxville, TN",10/29/2015,2.0,"I've eaten here four times.  With the exception of The Hurt Locker, I've never experienced anything beyond mediocre. The wait to get in doesn't help either, although this isn't the restaurant's fault.  I've listed the items below that I've eaten.House Fried Pickles:Bland.  Soggy.  Greasy.  The Chicken & Waffle:Burnt waffle.  All the batter fell off the chicken.  Bland.  Unexciting.  The Farmhouse:Bland.  Menu description irks me as I have a personal pet peeve for the phrasing ""Garlic Aioli"", as an aioli is nothing more than a mayonnaise with garlic.  Picky pet peeves aside, my burger managed to taste like nothing.The Hurt Locker:This burger was good!  It was flavorful, and I think the pimiento cheese more than anything made it.  I also tried the special during lunch one day.  I believe it had blueberry jam and jalapeños on it.  The ingredients sounded exciting, but the execution was lackluster. It was bland, and the jalapeños were raw.  I'm not exactly sure how you make a bland jalapeño burger, but they succeeded.  Fries are okay.It's worth mentioning that I wanted to enjoy this restaurant each time I went...just didn't happen."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Colleen T.,"Knoxville, TN",9/3/2018,4.0,"Delicious burger, and love their shakes too. The only thing I don't like is that the restaurant is teeny and so the wait is always very long."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,William M.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",6/24/2016,5.0,"My first visit for lunch today and I am impressed. Clearly this is a very popular place at lunch time, so first thing is get here early as it does not have a lot of seating.The service was excellent, from hostess, to wait staff, to a manager (maybe owner?). Everyone on the staff was friendly, helpful and working hard. They clearly are good at their jobs and helped me live my pickle phobia without judgement. LOLThe food? My mouth still waters from the memories! I had an amazing bacon cheeseburger, with Benton's bacon, and i never looked back. The fries were good, and plentiful. I look forward to trying the onion rings on a future visit.Highly recommended!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ben F.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",12/14/2016,4.0,"Cuban food in Blount County, TN?! Absolutely! An absolute must if you're in the area. This place truly satisfies the Cuban craving and they do it right and authentic."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ben F.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",7/22/2016,5.0,"I can see now why the wait for this place around dinner can be a couple hours. The restaurant is small, but the room is always packed. When you get that burger craving, this is where you need to go. The long list of different burger combinations will make your decision very hard because they all sound so good. The burger is very flavorful and juicy and the bun is locally baked here in Knoxville. I was skeptical of their award or ""Best Burger in Knoxville"", but I am a full believer now. The Farmhouse Burger, one of their best sellers, the duck confit fries with a side of their amazing garlic aioli, and a Nutella shake will have you talking about it the next day to all your friends."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Aubrey W.,"Bloomington, IN",10/8/2014,4.0,"While we were in Knoxville for a DAR event, my friend SM and I had a delicious meal at The Stock & Barrel, an establishment known for their selection of bourbon and burgers.  While the wait for a table on a Friday night was a couple of hours (there was a lot going on!) we were able to walk right up to the bar for food and drink.For my bourbon drink (a must!) I had the Bourbon Fizz, which was Belle Meade Bourbon, lemonade, and muddled strawberries with basil.  It was one of the less strong-tasting bourbon drinks (since I just can't handle the stronger stuff) but definitely delicious and refreshing.For my meal, I had the Farmhouse Burger, featuring barrel aged cheddar, Benton's Bacon (a TN farm-to-table powerhouse), a fried egg, and garlic aioli.  The meat was deliciously cooked.  Thumbs up from this burger fan!  I also upgraded my fries the Duck Confit fries, which I highly recommend.  They were so decadent, SM helped me finish them off.  The portions are huge at this place.I highly recommend you make reservations before you go, or call in to add your name to the list, especially given the small size of the restaurant plus its obvious popularity.  Otherwise you can sidle up to the bar like we did."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Greg C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/23/2016,5.0,"I'm big on service. Service can make or break a place for me. This place has great service. In addition to great service they have the best burger I have ever put in my pie hole. I recommend trying the bacon burger and some confit fries. For those of you who follow Kevin Smith "" I think I just filled the cup."" Well played Stock & Barrel, well played."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jim M.,"Orlando, FL",9/15/2017,5.0,"Passing through Knoxville and stopped for the night. Yelp suggested Stock & Barrel for a burger.  So we said sounds good.  Well that doesn't come even close to how amazing the burger was!!!  And the chicken and waffles sandwich.  WOW did I say WOW that doesn't cover it, all I can say is go no GO now stop reading GO NOW!  Also the pimento cheese appetizer!  And Becca was also great!!!  The honey bee cocktail.  Just GO now!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lori C.,"Spring Hill, TN",5/25/2018,5.0,"It's been two years since the first time we were here. Our memory was spot on. All three of us had a different burger, black and blue, the Bernie and the classic burger. All three of us agree it's the best burger we've ever had. Fries were amazing as well. Love this place, atmosphere, staff and food! All Amazing!! I don't give many reviews, but this place  is Delicious!! I wish they had one in Nashville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jill W.,"Houston, TX",5/23/2018,5.0,"Thank you Yelp for helping us find this! Everything was delicious! My 8 yr old son and I came for lunch. We got fried pickles, bacon burger and salmon burger. Everything was homemade - from the pickles to the bread. Such a nice surprise. Def recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel H.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/21/2018,4.0,"I've heard lots if people talk about this place but had never tried it. The wait time is excessive and they don't take reservations. The food, however, was worth the wait. We tried the opa fried feta topped with honey and served with bread as an appetizer, it was delicious. I tried the bison burger which I was expecting to be more flavorful than it actually was. It came with the duck confit fries which were rich, but very good. The portions are huge so it will make 2 meals for me. Overall, I enjoyed the experience."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shelda B.,"Covington, VA",5/20/2018,4.0,"If you've never had duck fat fries, you're missing out.....insanely delicious. The burgers here are creatively designed and a work of art. I enjoyed the outdoor dining, because we could bring Chester, the dog. Very friendly service and great location."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cambron W.,"Durham, NC",5/19/2018,4.0,"My wife and I had a great time here. Burgers were delicious, good beer selection, really friendly service, plus we got to sit outdoors. Great view of all the people on market square! I would definitely go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,oralia l.,"Grand Blanc, MI",5/18/2018,5.0,"SOOO GOOD!Everything about the burgers were delicious! The beef had a great flavor, bun was soft but stood up to the juiciness of the burger and ...THE BACON! Their fries were so good, we went back before we left town!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",5/16/2018,5.0,This place has the best fries and their burger selection is on point. If you like whiskey they also have a good variety to choose from. If you want something other than whiskey it might leave you wanting but if you're going here you already know whiskey is their thing. I wish the place was a little bigger as seating can feel cramped when they are busy but honestly that's something I can live with. Maybe try calling ahead but they have a great system where they text when your table is ready so feel free to shop around in the mean time
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2018,5.0,Hubby was craving a burger so gotta have the best. We're never disappointed here. Burger tender and cooked as ordered. Everything is fresh and tasty. Drinks were perfect. Service timely and spot on.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",7/1/2017,5.0,"Where to start. I can see why this was voted top 10 burgers in America.  We checked in and the hostess said it could be up to an hour, they'd text us. We got a text within 20 minutes. Wonderful cuz we were starving. Our fountain drinks and appetizer came out super fast. We had the fried green tomatoes. The batter was nice and light, they were cooked nicely- not raw like many places, and had just the right amount of goat cheese and balsamic. I ordered ""The Billy"" well done. The meat was cooked perfectly. There was no pink and the beef was seasoned. No extra condiments were wanted on the burger, the flavors of the goat cheese, tomato jam, bourbon caramelized onions, and Bentons Bacon was perfection. I upgraded to the dick fries, but their regular hand cut fries were just as good. I ordered an extra side of the black bean and corn salad- my opinion may have needed a little more acid, but the flavors were great. My cocktail was awesome. I had the bourbon, lemonade cocktail with muddled strawberry and basil. Deliciousness in a glass!  The local bakery made burger buns hold up beautifully while eating the burger. My husband had the. My husband had the Classic Bacon Burger. Again, cooked perfectly while still being tender and flavorful. The house made pickles are great!  Fries were awesome too. Stock & Barrel is definitely worth the wait. The food is awesome!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany T.,"Aurora, CO",5/15/2018,5.0,This place was amazing. Cozy seating and great beer!! The food is top notch and as fresh as you can get. Try the duck confit fries!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Zackery V.,"Knoxville, TN",5/14/2018,4.0,"Food is amazing, drink menu is nice. There's literally something there for anybody. Only negative thing I have to say is that the tables are a little too close together so time and and the person beside me hit elbows a few times. Other than that, you should definitely check this place out if you're on a splurge night."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mandie B.,"Farragut, TN",3/21/2015,4.0,"The food served at Stock and Barrel is really delicious. Almost all of the ingredients are local and super fresh, and the whiskey/scotch selection is quite impressive. I love fact that you can customize your order easily. I once asked our server if I should get fries or onion rings, and he said, ""have both!"" Um, yes please and thank you! We have always had excellent service no matter how busy the restaurant is, and that is one of the many things that keep us coming back at least once a month.The only issue is that there is almost always a 2 hour wait for dinner. We can arrive at 5pm and still have to wait forever. I'm not sure if the owners didn't expect it to be so successful or what, but now is the time to move into one of the larger locations now available in Market Square. At least there are a lot of cute shops to poke around while waiting. I also appreciate that they will text you when the table is ready, so there isn't a limit to where you can walk around."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessica S.,"Southaven, MS",2/27/2020,4.0,"Food is great! Staff is pretty friendly too. The menu isn't extensive, but you'll enjoy it. Get the white cheddar pimento dip!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,James F.,"Knoxville, TN",4/10/2016,5.0,"Picture it - 8:30 pm on a Sunday night. Crowds in market square are thinning, omitting the drunks singing songs about dead people at the pub across the plaza. The residual sounds of the city are dying off as the natives are retiring in preparation of the return of the work week. One restaurant remains awake, alert, and totally kick ass. Do yourself a favor and order the farmhouse, no lettuce or tomatoes, unless you're a Philistine. The patty was perfectly cooked and seasoned, while the egg placed on top was right in the middle of over easy and fully cooked. I have a lot more to say, but I've had a few beers (great beer too) and am about to fall asleep to dream of the same burger I had not too long ago."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ben C.,"Lexington, KY",1/23/2017,5.0,Great Food burger was slightly undercooked but it was great. The food was made in good time and there wasn't a huge wait. I suggest the hand cut fries and bacon burger. They both were very flavorful and made a good meal. Also the lemonade is fresh made there so that Is a god drink option.

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paul C.,"Pasig, Philippines",5/18/2016,5.0,"This place is always packed and you can tell why. Their burgers are the bomb. Overwhelming flavor in a good way. Service is pretty good too. The place can use some cleaning but I guess it comes with how busy they are.They say this is the best restaurant in Knoxville and I would say that's not a ridiculous claim.Expect a lot of waiting but it's worth it. If you're impatient, go walk around and don't worry because they'll even send you a text to inform you that it's time to go back if you happen to roam around Market Square while waiting."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bonnie H.,"Anaheim, CA",8/2/2017,4.0,"Traveling for work - and was staying in downtown Knoxville. Sat out on the patio and it made for great people watching :o)I had an awesome burger (that had fried jalapeño' so, blueberry jam, and bacon. The duck dipped Parmesan fries were also really really tasty.Great service - would definitely go there again when I am in town."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Savannah C.,"Old North Knoxville, Knoxville, TN",6/5/2019,5.0,Very nice and great place to eat! Best burgers in town in my opinion. I recommend the Ring of Fire burger of you live spicy!! Very cool art on walls and great whiskey selection!! The crab dip is super yummy! This place is always poppin! Expect a wait but it is worth it!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessyca B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/5/2019,5.0,"I know the wait is a lot to deal with, but it is always worth it. The fried feta is to die for. Along with the tomato salad. But honestly, everything on the menu is incredible."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michele H.,"New Orleans East Area, New Orleans, LA",7/27/2017,3.0,The food her was amazing! I had the Bernie and my husband had the Bison. The flavors of the Bernie were on point and they substituted onion rings for the fries at no extra charge. I gave them only 3 stars because the service was extremely slow. We there on a Thursday night after 7 and they weren't terribly busy but we had to wait to be greeted by our waiter after being seated for close to 10 minutes. He was very kind and friendly. Tip: if you want to drink here you have to show your ID. This being so close to campus they card absolutely everyone.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Andre L.,"Knoxville, TN",11/24/2017,5.0,"Amazing! This was our first time and we were quite impressed. Great service, great food, and great drinks. I would recommend this place to anybody! There was a bit of a wait but with the wait list on this app, that helped everything!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Skylar M.,"Knoxville, TN",4/18/2019,5.0,"Favorite Burger in Knoxville! Small place - so almost always a long wait. Prepare for a wait, and take a walk around market square, or check in early on waitlist to save your spot."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Clark M.,"Knoxville, TN",2/14/2020,2.0,I ordered a bacon and cheddar burger with duck fat fries last week. The burger was good but the fries had hardly any toppings on them and were so salty I couldn't even eat them. Fast forward a week later and  I decide to give it another chance. I ordered the same thing  and the fries were great. But the burger had chunks of pork on it that I wouldn't consider bacon. The pieces were  so  dry I couldn't chew it and it was so salty I couldn't eat it. It tasted like cured ham dipped in salt water.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alexandra B.,"New York, NY",4/17/2019,5.0,"Absolutely delicious!!!!! The taste was incredible and just made you want more. Also our server Dayna was super sweet, informative, and a great host! Will be back soon"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Suchitra K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",5/6/2017,5.0,"This burger and bourbon joint lives up to it's reputation of being #4 in Market Square, Knoxville. The ambience is great and the staff very courteous and helpful. We don't drink and so chose to use their outdoor seating. We had fried green tomatoes, fried mushrooms , smore milkshake and smoked salmon burger with avocado, garlic aioli, greens and onions. The burger came with their housefries. Their fries are supposed to be the best French fries! I will agree to that. The portions are large, the food is delicious. 4 of us ate that much food and were very full. I would definitely go there again!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tamandra T.,"Saint Louis, MO",5/17/2016,4.0,"Came here with my cousins and collectively we had the Greek Burger, Chicken and Waffles, and the Black and Blue. We also had the fried green tomatoes, fried mushrooms, and milkshakes. I also ordered chicken strips and fries for my baby boy. So....Brags!....My lamb burger was delicious!!!  It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I liked everything about it from the braised onions to the bun!  The fried mushrooms were amazing and the horseradish sauce that went with it was super good! My cousin loved the chicken and waffle sandwich and my sons chicken strips and fries were really fresh and good. The milkshakes were delicious. We had the Smores and the Nutella. They were really creamy and rich and had the perfwct consistency and flavor. The Smores was really good but dont expect ooey gooey marshmallows. They were only torched on the surface and the inside was cold.  My cousin said her nutella shake taste just like nutella and thats was the goal so dont order the nutella shake if you dont like Nutella...she loved it.My cousin had the black and blue burger...she said something was not meshing well together with the flavors and she didnt finish hers. I dont eat blue cheese so i cant further elaborate on that. She did say the actual burger was good but not the fondue on it.  She said she would def come back though but just not get that one. The fried green tomatoes were cooked perfectly however as much as i like goat cheese, i wasnt feeling it with the tomatoes. The combo was just odd, too much tartness. It would be better with something sweeter like tomato jam or even just plain. I also ordered the tomato salad as a side with my burger and it the tomatoes were overly soggy. Ill pass on that. Service was just okay. It started off good then it slowly tapered off. We didnt see the waitress for a long stretch of time and had to flag her down for some extra napkins. Oh and let me not forget that we had to wait 35 mins on a Monday night at 730pm to get a table. I didnt ask, but id check to see if you can get your name on the list in advance or make a reservation.Other than that, this place is pretty good. I didnt have any scotch but the flights looked good. I'd definitely come back"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paige T.,"Knoxville, TN",9/18/2016,5.0,Just go and get a burger and the duck fat fries.My only compliant is the put the wrong ice in my old fashioned - I can live with that!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tamara J.,"Matthews, NC",4/30/2017,5.0,"Quaint and delicious.  Ordered Stock and Barrel Flight, White American Cheddar Pimento cheese with pita chip appetizer, and Ring of Fire Burger. Recommend each item. Glad we stopped in Knoxville."

Recommend each item. Glad we stopped in Knoxville. Our waiter was named Casey and he did a great job. He anticipated our needs and made suggestions or brought things before we even asked."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alexandra S.,"Annapolis, MD",1/1/2019,2.0,"Not awful but far from great would sum up my experience here. Both my order and my husbands order weren't correct- I asked for 1/2 and 1/2 with no bacon. Got all onion rings and bacon on my burger. My husband ordered the American and it didn't have lettuce, tomato, or pickles on it. Soooo weird. Service was spotty and we had to wait 10 minutes to get our check. All in all it sounds like we had a uniquely bad experience but I won't be rushing to come back here any time soon."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rina M.,"Nashville, TN",3/17/2014,5.0,"There is absolutely nothing negative to say about Stock & Barrel. My first time was yesterday. I was impressed with their food, the facility, the servers (mine and  others) their bathrooms and the ambiance. This is definitely a place I know where people evolve into regulars.The inside of their restaurant is lightly-dimmed and intimate. While much of their light focuses on their wide selection of whiskey, set atop a shelf, like highly-praised classic novels at a library, don't forget your date sitting inches away from you. You can tell they pride themselves on their whiskey, because I could not spot one clear bottle up there. The lowly-dimmed lights create a more intimate experience at the Stock & Barrel. So you probably wouldn't be seen scarfing down their delightful burgers, with mayo, horse radish or bleu cheese fondue oozing out of your bottom lip. Relax. The servers are welcoming and kind. My server prepared my order right  the very first time. Not only was my order  on point, but the man who sat next to me seemed pleased with his waiter. The customer next to me was inquiring about the different selection of beers they offered and his server was dedicated enough to provide him with samples that would suit his palate for the day. TIP: You have to come here for their burgers. I enjoy turkey and veggie burgers more often than red meat, but yesterday, I thought I would only be depriving myself and regretfully living my life if I did not indulge in their godly-crafted creations. So I did. I chose the Shroomer (because mushrooms are a thing for me) and I wolfed it down like a mad man. I was with my date, and I don't even think we said a single word to one another, unless our conversation spoke and breathed Stock & Barrel's burgers. Their burger names are entertaining and you can possibly tell a story with each of them, considering they're fun and quirky.Their shakes - I was fortunate enough to invest my thirst and hunger into their S'more shake. It was not overbearingly sweet, but had enough flavor to bring me back to SoCal's bonfire nights: it tasted as if I was having a s'more in the form of a shake - nothing less, nothing more. Their bathrooms didn't smell like a bathroom, well-stocked and are clean (at least the women's) - What else do you need to know about their bathrooms?I would come back here and suggest everyone to try this place out if you're in town."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,MJ C.,"Central Florida, FL",7/30/2018,5.0,"Wow! Food are truly on the top quality! I had Mother Clucker, I never had anything as delicious as this one. Fries are amazing! Sweet tea is just right. Not too sweet or too sour. Tess, our server, is amazing today. Super friendly. Even directed our little one, 5 years old to use other bathroom thats not even necessary but amazing! We definitely will come back here one day. We love the cute little old school town style. Kids from age 5, 11, 14 said wow the food are awesome. Good priced indeed."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rich L.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",4/7/2019,5.0,"The food was outstanding, the wait may be long but it's well worth it. Staff is friendly and helpful but the food is fantastic."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Daegan L.,"Johnson City, TN",10/8/2019,1.0,"We will not be going back. And if you have any age or physical difference in your ID photo versus your present self, I wouldn't suggest visiting here. I am a 25 year old grown man. I ordered a drink and showed my ID, it was okay. Then as the bartender is holding my drink, walks up and asks for my ID again, no problem I showed her my ID. Then was denied my drink because I had a beard in my ID photo and was clean shaven at the time. Being 25 years old, this was the first and only time this has happened to me since my 21st birthday. I was furious so me and my girlfriend up and left without ordering any food and went to The Burgers on Sutherland- which I can honestly say, without any bias taking place, much better burgers and food compared to the previous time we visited Stock and Barrel. They also have plenty more room and seating so there's never really a wait and you won't be crammed into a tiny hole in the wall. But their loss I guess, I'm always a very generous tipper."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah P.,"Knoxville, TN",3/23/2016,4.0,"This is the place you go to when you have guests in town and they're in a burger mood. It feels special for company, it embodies the rustic charm of Knoxville,  and there are some delicious items on the menu. I bring out-of-towners here each time I come, and they're always satisfied and impressed. My table has tried several burgers, and they've all been phenomenal. Basically, pick the flavor combo that suits your tastes, and you're good to go. The quality is always there. The duck confit fries are amazing. Rich and delicious. You probably won't finish them, but they'll crisp up again in a hot oven.Some menu items I could do without? The Mac and cheese is lacking. I'm not a fan of the stuff in general (blasphemy, I know), but my sisters, who are Mac and cheese connoisseurs, all declared it to be completely flavorless. The spicy crab dip is...okay. I wouldn't order it again unless another dinner companion requests it. It's definitely rich and creamy, but it almost tasted like I was eating spicy canned clam chowder on a pita crisp. Come here for a special meal with guests, but avoid this place if you want a comfortable dinner date. You'll be seated way too close to other diners (it's downtown, so that makes sense, but still), and the chairs/booth seats are very stiff and uncomfortable."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gage M.,"Knoxville, TN",4/6/2019,5.0,An incredible meal every time! The bartenders are friendly and the whiskey selection is on point. Would always recommend for a great burger in Knoxville! Don't forget to try the duck confit fries.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joey S.,"Rogersville, TN",5/17/2019,3.0,"Good food, the Yelp app should be more user friendly tho. We called trying to get on the wait list, they dont do reservations.  They told us to get the Yelp app and get on the waiting list via this app. My question is how? Installed the help app, found the restaurant....and nothing,  no get on the waiting list option! Why tell folks to get on your waiting list through this run around app...."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brooks B.,"Atlanta, GA",7/23/2018,4.0,"Duck fat fries. These are a must and not a lot of people in this area do such duck fat fries - like other more touristy places such as Charleston, SC. So this definitely makes SB stand out more. You can't go wrong with any choice here. Also, there is always a long wait on popular days such as the weekend or event day around market square. It would be beneficial to plan out a less crowded time to go to truly enjoy! Seating is limited in the small place."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jen W.,"Knoxville, TN",3/31/2019,5.0,The Free Bird Burger was absolutely fantastic! Service was super quick for Saturday Night and the staff was awesome. Will definitely be back!

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah H.,"Louisville, TN",3/28/2019,5.0,"Literally the best burger I have ever had. And I know my burgers. I got the Bison and was floored at how good it was. The mushrooms, the Boursin cheese. Amazing. My husband got the Bernie and I almost died when I tried it. The jalapeños with the blueberry was insanely good. Our friend tried the Elvis and said it was incredible with the peanut butter. The duck fries were good but nothing can compare to those burgers. You need this burger."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stephen S.,"Decatur, GA",8/26/2016,4.0,"Great ambiance, nice wait staff and wide selection. The menu has multiple and unique choices when it comes to types of burgers (standard,.chicken, salmon).

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tyler H.,"San Francisco, CA",3/26/2019,5.0,"I can't say enough great things about the food and staff here! Today I had a very small problem with my burger being medium rare instead of medium well. I called and explained that there was more pink than I would've liked and without hesitation, they said they would remake it. When I went to go pick it up the bartender handed me my burger and ALSO gave me a $15 gift card for the trouble. You see, that's the kind of service people love and enjoy. They didn't have to do that but they went above and beyond and I promise you, they have a customer for life. #S&B2020 #Eatmoreburgers #thepeopleschamp"

Also, this spot is a serious contender for the ""best burger"" in Knoxville. No joke, the burgers are amazing! The atmosphere is cool, and the staff is always friendly. Great place to grab some food."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Becky C.,"Knoxville, TN",1/20/2019,5.0,I love this place!! My favorite place to sit is at the bar. Food is outstanding and very good service. One of my fav places
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michelle W.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",10/20/2016,4.0,"Their burgers. Wow. We were wandering around the downtown area of Knoxville looking for a place to eat. We decided on this place on a whim. Glad that we ended up here! My boyfriend and I both like spicy food, so we ended up splitting the Ring of Fire and the  chicken and waffles. For the chicken and waffles, the waffles serve as the burger bun, which is a fun concept. Between the two, I preferred the burger to the friend chicken and waffles. The burger was spicy in all the right ways! We also split an appetizer of the Opa! That was probably my favorite (although everything was good). The feta was flash fried to perfection, and paired perfectly with the honey. Also, the bread was delicious. I'm not sure what kind of bread they used, but it was sooo delicious! It was light and fluffy, but still had a nice crispy to the outside. They also use this same bread for their burgers. Just adds to all the deliciousness. We were starving by the time we finally got lunch here, and thought that we might not have enough food. However, we were all pleasantly surprised when we finished and felt very satiated and satisfied. The servings are deceptively bigger than expected."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ken H.,"Lilburn, GA",1/13/2018,5.0,"The service here was definitely on point. It was definitely packed on a Friday night at 10:00pm.  I sat at the bar as a walk in as it was long wait for the regular seating area. I ordered the farm house burger (Barrel Aged Cheddar, Fried Egg, Benton's Bacon, Tomatoes, Onion, Garlic Aioli) and duck confit fries. I have to say that it was a very delicious burger and fries were pretty good too. Definitely order the ginger-vitis when you are here! Amazing cocktail!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cooper D.,"Knoxville, TN",10/24/2020,5.0,"WOW! Great burger and fries! Fresh and hot! I haven't been to Stock and Barrel in a couple years. Thought I'd go with family and see how it is.  In the past I just thought it was average. Those memories are now replaced. When I ordered, I decided to try the Farmhouse. I like variety and trying new things, so why not?! When the burger came out I was like ""Woah. Thing looks great!""!the bun looks homemade and it was a perfect amount. Not too much or too little bread. They also had a gluten free bread option too. I took a bite and there was so much flavor. The flavors of the burger and toppings complemented each other so well! The fries also had a great seasoning on them too. It must have been like a secret seasoning or something. I can't remember what it was called. Just sitting here writing this review makes me want the burger again. So good! Definitely going back. I also joined the clean plate club! Great food! If you want an exotic burger or something simple, they've got it. You have to try this place whether you're a local or just passing through Knoxville. Only thing that wasn't great was our server. They forgot to check on us occasionally and refill drinks. Other wise it was great meal! Stop thinking about where to go and eat here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeff K.,"Reno, NV",4/6/2018,5.0,"We were so impressed by this restaurant. We were told by locals that they had great burgers. I was not inspired. However, we went because it was not too far. I am so glad we did.First, finding this restaurant took us to a really fun place, a bit of a plaza. Lots of stores and restaurants on a very wide, closed street. It was very nice and pleasant at night.The food itself was much better than a burger joint. This is so much better than fast-food, even if it is really quick. We had a really tasty ""spicy crab dip"" appetizer and a basic hamburger, topped of with a piece of chocolate-peanut butter cheesecake. It was all absolutely marvelous. Nicely blended and accented flavors.Finally, the service rocked. I hope your waitress is as good as Taylor was for us. She made dinner a fun experience. A beautiful personality who cared upon making us feel special.I heartily recommend this wonderfully excellent ""burger-joint""!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ann A.,"Baton Rouge, LA",1/7/2020,4.0,"Favorite place to get a burger in Knoxville! Price were decent. You definitely end up real full. First places I've eaten since moving here. Perfect date night spot, especially if your sitting outside."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Douglas W.,"Atlanta, GA",11/27/2017,5.0,"Can't say enough about this place. Stopped in on a Sunday night and it was the only restaurant in Market Square still buzzing. My family ordered an appetizer of the Opa, which is flash fried feta, honey and bread. The feta and honey paired well together and complimented the well crafted old fashioned from the bar. Both cocktails were strong and they also had Sweetwater Triple Tail on draft, which was a pleasant surprise being an Atlantan now living in Chicago. I got the Billy Burger (goat cheese, bacon, tomato jam, and onions) and it may have been the best burger I've had this year. The Bentons bacon was wonderful, and the bun brought it all together. Not like you can go wrong with cheese, burgers and bourbon, but everything about the experience was top notch."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sam R.,"Greater Heights, Houston, TX",3/6/2019,4.0,"Damn good turkey burger and incredible bourbon stock! I called in an order ahead b/c i had a movie to catch, i asked for them to save me a seat at the bar, i walked in told the host who i was, he directed me to my seat at the bar, the tender knew who i was already, food came out within 5 mins at 5:45 pm during rush, i swallowed  my burger and made it during previews. Very accommodating staff!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,S S.,"York, PA",3/5/2019,5.0,"Great service and their burgers are simply awesome.  They even have a burger called the Elvis which has peanut butter and bananas on, which I was not brave enough to try.  If I lived in Knoxville this is a place I would frequent"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David Z. W.,"Rumson, NJ",6/6/2016,5.0,"I'm really happy right now. I had one night in Knoxville and I'm glad that I stopped here. Good beer selection,  great whiskey selection. The burgers ARE as good as advertised. I had the farmhouse. It was appropriately rare, nice thick cut bacon,  fried egg on a perfect bun. I have mild to medium meat sweats right now because I took it down like Kobayashi on 4th of July."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jack S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/27/2020,5.0,This is a must try for anybody coming to KX. Best burgers in the city and possibly the state. Maybe the world?
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John Patrick C.,"Washington, DC",8/15/2017,5.0,"Loved the atmosphere of this place! Tucked towards the end of Market Square is this lovely gem of a restaurant. The cocktails were heavy on they/whiskey, but the bartender gladly switched that for some vodka.I ordered the Hurt Locker, which has pimento cheese, fried green tomatoes, and caramelized onions and it was to die for! Massive serving of fries to accompany the main course. My friends got the chicken and waffles that they weren't able to finish.Overall, phenomenal restaurant! Definitely worth a visit in Knoxville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Caroline H.,"Maryville, TN",6/27/2018,5.0,"One of (if not the) best burgers I've ever had. Such a cool and rustic atmosphere with great service, but be ready to wait for a table. Their duck confit fries are to DIE for."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tara S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/27/2014,4.0,"Finally checked this spot out. Everyone who raved about the food was so right on. Since I went somewhat early getting a spot at the bar was a breeze, but the place was full and there was a line waiting for tables by the time I left (about 2pm on a Saturday). The interior is a nice set up, and it never got too stupid loud even with the crowd. The bar is nice and was comfortable enough for eating at even when full/crowded.We started with beers. They have a good selection on tap, with a mix of classics & seasonal varieties, local breweries represented fairly well. Next up was the white cheddar pimento cheese for an appetizer. This was the bomb. The cheese is baked and topped with tomato jam that is so delicious. Apparantly they sell the jam so you could replicate this at home for maybe a Super Bowl thing or get together. (Or just to eat it all yourself I suppose).Burgers: I had the Black & Bleu. The burger is seasoned blackened-style, topped wtih blue cheese fondue, crispy fried onions and Benton's bacon. This was delicious! I would definitely get it again. My friend had the Hurt Locker which is popular for obvious reasons. Fried green tomato, Benton's bacon, bourbon onions, Pimento cheese. The fries that accompanied both dishes were perfect - crispy and hot and thin in size.We didn't have bourbon; honestly it is lost on me and my review wouldn't be worth much to any true bourbon afficionado anyway. We also did not have dessert but I've heard the milkshakes (featuring bourbon) and Peanut Butter pie are fantastic.I will definitely return! They have tons of amazing-sounding burgers I cannot wait to try."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jack C.,"Suwanee, GA",9/26/2018,5.0,Great burgers and an awesome bourbon selection! We had the hurt locker and the Bernie. I was reluctant about the Bernie but it was actually really good! I also had a flight of bourbon which was awesome to try the different bourbons. I would highly recommend Stock & Barrel.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jamie N M.,"Oneida, TN",12/18/2018,4.0,Delicious huge burgers!  Burgers are so big you can't finish a whole one.  Staff is supper friendly and restaurant is in a great location at Market Square.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1/2/2014,4.0,"It is stoopid how awesome this place is!!!  I hope to Jebus they open one in NYC! ....then again.....I'd weigh 400 lbs.....but I'd be happy about it!!!!!I love that they text you when your table is ready.  That allowed for us to go shopping while we waited, while not having to carry around a buzzer/stay within range/stay close to hear our names.Loved the exposed brick and artwork.  Our server was just tops!  She recognized my friends (including the temperatures they like their burgers!!!), even though they had only been in a handful of times, and the last time at least 6 months ago!  Every drink we had was masterfully crafted, and packed the appropriate punch.  The bourbon list is awesome!  Every drink was served in the proper glass, and with the proper amount of liquid!Their crab dip??  I'm still talking about it a week later.  It is the stuff of which dreams are made!!!!  The duck fat fries are the best I've ever had.  My friend and I shared The Hurt Locker and the Chicken & Waffle.  My friend likes medium-well.  I dealt (as I like medium-rare).  The temperature was perfect.  The medium-well was as juicy as a medium-rare would be.  The pimento cheese was orgasmic in combination with everything else.  And they serve up one of the single best variations on chicken and waffles which I have ever experienced.The mac & cheese?  Near perfection.  And that S'mores shake???  The only thing better was when the server, who had read me right the entire meal, said, ""No.  You're not ordering the PB&J shake.  I'm making you a Nutella Shake with S'mores topping.  Okay?  Okay :-)""For three of us - who consumed two apps, eight alcoholic drinks, three burgers, and two shakes - the tab was $137 before tip.  Not too shabby for the experience and quality.My only qualm is that service, while of the highest quality, was really slow.  I think the tables around us turned over twice during the course of our meal.  Mind you, our server was super awesome and checked in to let us know that there was an issue with our order, but she and the kitchen were on top of it.  Still, I found myself getting to the, ""Uhmm.....hello?"" point a few times throughout the meal.Still, I've been to Voltaggio restaurants.  I live in NYC.  I've traveled internationally.  I've been blessed to have sampled the best from renowned chefs, both burger and otherwise.  The chef(s?) here not only match the best I've experienced, but, in many ways, excel beyond.  I can't imagine that I will ever visit Knoxville again without coming here the second I'm within city limits."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Thomas H.,"Dallas, TX",10/7/2016,5.0,"Good foodGood drinksGood serviceGood location Fair pricesWoud recommend to anyone, my endorsement!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gloria S.,"Black Mountain, NC",10/16/2018,3.0,Burgers were great. Husband got Beacon burger & I got shroom. I got half & half fries & onion rings. I didn't like the fires or onion rings. He did. A little pricey for burgers & fries. But if you come down town everything is expensive. Great customer service & the place is super cute. The atmosphere is dark because of the lighting they have.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nick V.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2020,2.0,"The burgers were not as good as I have heard people talk about. It was very bland and soggy(even though it was cooked well done). The atmosphere is decent, but small and crowded. The best part of our experience was the service we received from our waitress. I wish I remembered her name, but not one time did anyone run out of a drink nor did we ever have to ask for something."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jamie L.,"Ferndale, MI",4/21/2018,4.0,"Good burgers and service. They have a lot of choices for burgers and for drinks, everyone had an easy time finding something they liked. I tried the billy and it was delicious. The beef itself had a lot of good flavor and texture. The bun held up to the patty and toppings. The amount of toppings were not excessive which I appreciate. A lot of times novelty burgers are impossible to bite into but these were the perfect size and you don't feel like they are skimping. Fries and onion rings were good and you get a good amount. My coworkers swear by the PB&J burger but I did not try it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John Amanda C.,"Nashville, TN",11/2/2018,5.0,Awesome. Amazing. Go back? Heck yes! Food...drinks...staff...everything is perfect! Their burgers are THE best and they have GLUTEN free buns. Yum
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kellie B.,"Moyock, NC",12/7/2018,5.0,A must visit when we come to Knoxville! Love the burgers and the fried pickles!  The billy and the bison are our faves! Typically there is a wait but it's worth it!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sheila P.,"Wilmington, DE",3/27/2016,3.0,My husband and I walked in on a Saturday night and knew we would be in for a wait. Fortunately they have a way of holding reservations which uses an app on your phone. You can see how many people are ahead of you and will receive a text when your table is ready. Every restaurant should have this. Pros: -The service was good and attentive. -Reservation app-Drinks: I had the noreaster cocktail which was good. Basically a Moscow mule with bourbon. -Outdoor seatingCons:Food: My husband ordered the turkey burger and I got the hurt locker. His didn't have much flavor. The only reason the hurt locker was good was because of the pimento cheese.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert B.,"Knoxville, TN",1/5/2016,4.0,"Love it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is expensive.  I was surprised when I got my bill.  It is after all, hamburgers, even though it is probably the best hamburgers I have ever had.  The Bernie is fantastic (Bernie Burger, you eat it, someone else pays for it), the Hurt Locker, wonderful.  The Confit fries are good although too salty for me.  My wife loved them.Great place for bourbon.  They must have over a hundred different bourbons.  By doing a flight (4, 1/2 shots), I was able to find a new favorite bourbon.  It was crowded, as always, plus it was New Years Eve.The service is good.  Prompt and friendly.  You get a text message on your phone when your table is ready.All in all, we had a great time."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Courtney S.,"Savannah, GA",11/14/2015,5.0,"Stopped here for lunch while on our way to Gatlinburg for the weekend. Husband and I shared a burgers and the duck confit fries. We had the special burger of the day, McLovin. It was fantastic!!! Probably the top burger of my life. We opted for the duck confit fries because duh. THEY WERE INCREDIBLE! I want to stop here on the way back to Nashville just so I can eat these fries again. They have a decent draft selection, could be larger but that didn't bother us. Kinda small on the inside so I'm sure it could get busy during peak times but it's so worth the wait!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeff L.,"Powell, TN",2/4/2019,5.0,Great burgers and atmosphere.  Highly recommended. Best burgers in Knoxville. Go there with my daughter and we both love the atmosphere and food.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jonathan G.,"Brooksville, FL",1/2/2016,5.0,"Every time I'm within a few hours of Knoxville I come here. The burgers are the best non chain burger I've ever had. Get the duck-fat-fried fries, somehow even better than the burgers. I've been here many times and had many of their burgers, get them all, cut them up and share them with your friends. You'll thank me later. Cheers!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeffrey L.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2016,4.0,"I never knew there were so many kinds of bourbon!  Bourbon really isn't my thing, as I'm more a beer and vodka person.  That wasn't an issue as there are several selections besides bourbon.  There was a wait last time I went, however, it wasn't long.  If you go when it's cold outside, you REALLY need to get seated as far away from the door as possible.  The constant open and close makes it really uncomfortable.  But I suppose that comes with the territory.  The burgers are FANTASTIC.  Seriously, you couldn't find a burger that wasn't good at this place.  And the duck fat fries?  WOW!!  It's a little cramped in this place, however, the superior food and drinks made it do-able.  Definitely somewhere to repeat."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sunna K.,"Buford, GA",6/19/2017,5.0,"Where to begin! The food was absolutely delicious, the duck confit fries are a must try :) The service was excellent, both at the bar as well as after we were seated at a table. Our server Sara was really sweet and helpful, and the Nutella milkshake was the best milkshake we have ever had! The bar was very well stocked and the cocktail were great.Overall a great atmosphere and we'll definately be back!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cheryl T.,"POWELL, TN",10/12/2016,4.0,"I had very high expectations of Stock and Barrel and you know what happens when you set the bar too high! We started off with the lump crab dip. It was tasty! The pita chips were toasty and crunchy. The dip had a little bit of a kick but nothing that should scare anyone off. Their cocktails were fantastic! I had the ""Bourbon Fizz"" It was not too sweet or too sour, and it sure was pretty. I only gave four stars because of the bun. I had the 'Merican and it was perfect outside of the bun. I had high hopes for the bun as I am familiar with the local bakery they use so I figured it would be off the chart good. I found it a little bland and the worse part was it ended up soggy fast. Boo. If I am going to do an old fashioned burger it better have a nice, toasty, and buttered bun.If you sit outside you are bound to be entertained by the vast amount of people watching opportunities and ""Local talent."" We were serenaded by a couple very loud hippies that took advantage of the echoing space of the square. Overall it was a nice lunch and we will go back again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Renee H.,"San Antonio, TX",4/17/2019,1.0,"So sorry to be giving a one star review,  because I like to focus on what is positive. But found this place on Yelp. Saw there was ""wait list"" on a Weds, so I'm thinking 'Wow, this place must be pretty good! Sign me up."" I arrived when the text came my table was ready. Noted that I am a ""party of 1"". But upon arriving hostess said I'd have to wait for an outdoor table and should have requested it. Mmm. OK? Sorry. No worries. I'll just grab a drink and wait for my reserved table. Got seated, a menu put in front of me. And I'm waiting. .waiting. .glass of water? Anything? And then a party that got seated next me immediately had a waiter asking for their order.  Wow. I must be invisible. So I waited 25 minutes because I'm patient. Finally after watching people get their food and no one bothered to check on me at the ""reserved table"". I was like . Ok. Bye. Wish I could have tried your food. But there's plenty of restaurants around and I don't need to wait or be ignored."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brenda S.,"Mansfield, OH",11/24/2019,5.0,First visit to downtown Knoxville but what a great find!  We loved everything about this place.  The hurt locker burger and onion rings are the best EVER!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ann R.,"Milwaukee, WI",11/4/2015,5.0,"Great selection of burgers whether you like your burgers plain or on the adventurous side. Even the black bean burger is really dang good, and I have no vegetarian tendencies.Only complaint is the wait time. Plan accordingly; whether it's Saturday afternoon or Thursday evening, you'll need to kill some time before you actually get a table. Since it's always packed, also means it can get a little on the loud side. But the food is worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Naomi C.,"Denver, CO",7/18/2018,3.0,"Centrally located in the downtown area directly in market square, making for a great location. The restaurant is small and the tables are very close, however the staff is friendly and service is acceptable. There is a front patio to eat on so you can enjoy the sights and sounds of market square. The food is average for me , nothing too special. Worth a visit though"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sara P.,"Austin, TX",1/17/2019,4.0,Cute restaurant in market square with a turkey burger to die for! The fries are very sad and not what I look forward to when eating here. Restaurant is small so there is usually always a wait but you can get on the waitlist before you show up.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike M.,"San Francisco, CA",11/10/2019,5.0,Excellent food great place to stop in and grab a bite. My food  was cooked perfectly and the portions are generous. Couldn't finish and I am stuffed.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Carrie P.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",1/10/2020,5.0,"Always busy so you know it must be great, but usually get a table within 30 min. It's worth the wait. Great food, good service, and relaxed atmosphere."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sonia D.,"Baltimore, MD",3/26/2016,5.0,"This may be the best place to get a burger in the whole country. Like the ENTIRE country. We were in Knoxville for a night on our way to Nashville and we were starving and this place had great reviews. It was an hour wait but they have this app that will notify you when you're table is ready, so you can go enjoy other things in the square while you wait. Anyway I had the bison burger and it changed my life. It was so rich I actually couldn't finish it -- but it was mind blowing. The combination of flavors of the mushrooms, onions, cheese and garlic aioli was incredible. And they are served with duck confit fries. My friend and I dream of these burgers and honestly if I'm ever headed to Nashville again I may take a pit stop in Knoxville just to get a burger here. Also -- bourbon drinks are on point."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Justin E.,"Knoxville, TN",5/5/2018,5.0,Amazing! Hands down my favorite place to get a burger...ever! Then there's a library of bourbon too! Always get the duck confit fries. The milkshakes are fantastic if there's any room left.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Adam R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/24/2016,5.0,"Well worth the wait! After 2 years I finally had a chance to eat here. We got in line at home with the No Wait app and it was a blessing since there was about a 2 hour wait. Once we finally made it to a table the fun began. My father in law and I started out with bourbon flights. I had the Tennessee and Kentucky which ran around  $16 and it was well worth it. He had the small batch flight for $20 which was also tasty. Great way to start! Now to the food....I ordered the bison burger which had mushrooms, Boursin cheese, crispy onions, garlic aioli, served with duck confit fries. Amazing! Maybe the best burger I've ever had. The fries were amazing if you don't mind a lil grease. Def get an extra garlic aioli on the side for the fries. My wife got the black bean and corn salad with chicken and she loved it. My father in law got the farm house with a fried egg and really enjoyed it. So all in all it's worth the wait! Can't wait to go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Krissi L.,"Johnson City, TN",1/6/2019,5.0,The food was a major nut!!! The server was really nice and looked like a typical hipster.

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Wesley L.,"Philadelphia, TN",9/30/2015,5.0,"Our latest trip to the Stock & Barrel was as good as ever. We began with the House Fried Pickles. We've had fried pickle appetizers at several places and they are normally 5 - 6 fried spears with dressing ""X"" for dipping. The Stock & Barrel served us a plate FULL of sliced house-made pickles with ranch dressing. It was easily enough for the four of us. I also had a flight of whiskey - The Stock & Barrel -  nice moniker. My young bride is not a whiskey drinker, but pronounced her Bourbon Fizz ""yummy.""We split The Classic Bacon Burger and it came out already halved for us with separate spears to hold it together, as well as mustard and mayo on the side so we could apply it as we chose. I had the Black Bean & Corn Salad as a side, while my young bride had the Village Tomato Salad. Both were excellent, but I will be learning to make the Black Bean & Corn for home consumption.Service was - as normal - excellent. The recommendations were helpful and accurate; the arrival and removal of plates timely. We have yet to have a questionable experience here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Wesley L.,"Philadelphia, TN",7/28/2015,5.0,"Stock & Barrel does plain and fancy burgers (including an Elvis burger with peanut butter and fried bananas). There is no possibility that a burger lover cannot find something to love here. The beer-battered onion rings got me to learn to love them after years of abstention.Also, there is a whiskey for anyone who loves the brown liquor. Corn, rye, whatever. The atmosphere is casual, so a tux would be too much. It's a touch loud inside also. There is SOME outdoor seating, but it is limited.The service is normally good/very good and the help will spout opinions about the dishes if you need assistance. For me, the best burger joint in Knoxville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Andrea S.,"Joelton, TN",1/4/2020,5.0,This was a great find as we passed through Knoxville.  We loved the atmosphere and even though it was packed we were quickly waited on.  Our server was very personable and checked on us often.  The bacon burgers we had were delicious and the fries hot and fresh.  If you are a bourbon lover you can't go wrong here!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,AJ N.,"Knoxville, TN",1/4/2019,4.0,Great food and excellent whiskey.  Don't go there on a weekend unless you are willing to wait a long time.  Monday-Wednesday excellent.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Steven D.,"Long Beach, CA",9/24/2015,5.0,"Perhaps the best burger I have ever had. I am a burger freak, one that will try one at a fancy restaurant to a hole in the wall. But the Buffalo Burger and Duck Fries are a combination worth repeating many times over. The meat was perfected seasoned and it was extremely juicy, well cooked with cheese and the sweetest grilled onions to compliment all the flavors of the Bison meat. The restuarant is nice but small, more like a fancy and rustic hole-in-the-wall eatery with a fun patio and good food. They are dog friendly and absolutely treated my dog to a bowl of ice water and a salt-free puppy patty."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Warren B.,"Sterling, VA",7/1/2016,4.0,Each time I come here I order the Farmhouse. It's great each time. Then I sample everyone else's. LOL
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany M.,"Athens, TN",4/10/2018,5.0,"Where do I start? The location is in the heart of Market Square, right around the corner from the free parking garage. The space is pretty small so the wait can be a little lengthy. There are plenty of charming little shops nearby to browse while you wait. Once inside you will see they are fully committed to burgers and bourbon. That is their specialty. However, if you prefer gluten free or veggie burgers, they do have those options. They have unique pairings on their menu like a PB&J burger, try it once! It's really surprising, not sure I would order it again but it's fun once. There are so many to choose from, it keeps me coming back over and over. They ingredients are locally sourced, bread is from a local bakery, beef is from a local farm, bacon is from Benton's Bacon, etc. everything is melt in your mouth good! The duck fries are a must and the OPA is also a favorite! Come hungry and don't skip dessert! It actually gives the burgers a run for their money. Milk shakes made with Cruze Farms milk and ice cream. To. Die. For. Nutella and s'mores are just a couple flavors they offer. The patio is animal friendly! I honestly can not find one bad thing to say about this place. I love it!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kristin B.,"Asheville, NC",10/24/2015,4.0,"My family and friends had a wonderful experience at Stock & Barrel. We had a 2 hour wait for our table, but that time was easily filled by walking around the market and stopping for some pre-dinner drinks and apps at a tavern a few blocks away. We had a party of 6, and no one was disappointed with their experience. Our waitress, Casey, did an amazing job. Make sure to try the Hammer Thyme!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Greg L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/14/2017,4.0,"Food was amazing, but the service was terrible .  Had to ask our waitress for napkins and fork, and repeatedly asked for my drinks.  Could have been easily a 3 star with adding the price 51.24 plus tip wasn't bad for all the food and drinks I got."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kimberly A.,"Long Beach, CA",10/26/2015,5.0,My mom and I randomly decided to stop here on our road trip from NC to Cali because the pictures looked good. Boy oh boy it didn't disappoint! It was a 30 min wait but it's in such a cute artsy area that you can easily enjoy looking around till they text you that your tables ready. We ordered the duck fries appetizer and a Deadhead black bean burger. Both were fantastic!! Will definitely come again on our next road trip!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Keichele N.,"Mount Vernon, KY",7/8/2016,5.0,"This was an awesome burger! The atmosphere was great and service was great. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great burger while in Knoxville. Had the Farmhouse Burger, it was great!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stevie Z.,"Worcester, MA",8/15/2015,5.0,"This restaurant really exemplifies the Knoxville's hipster vibe. The entire back-side of the menu is whiskey, everything is locally sourced, and the burgers are to die for. Their signature burger is the Bison Burger served with duck confit fries. Let me tell you, that meal put me in a euphoric state. If meat isn't your thing, they also have excellent salads and other dishes that I would definitely recommend.Would I recommend this?Absolutely, it is a must if you are in Knoxville"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,C E.,"Anderson, SC",10/20/2019,4.0,"Turkey burger + tomorrow jam = Gloriousness. Our waitress, Macy, was delightful and awesome. Will def go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tom L.,"Saint Louis, MO",10/20/2018,5.0,One of the best burgers I've ever had and they have a really great atmosphere. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were really busy but they remained very pleasant. I will definitely be back.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Micah S.,"Chillicothe, OH",10/19/2018,5.0,This was top five burger I've ever ate. The Hurt Locker with duck fries is a winner. There was a 2 1/2 hour wait but we got a seat at the bar so keep that in mind. Knoxville's burger game is on point!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amy L.,"Knoxville, TN",5/14/2018,5.0,"I have never been disappointed! They have wonderful burgers! Whenever we have people visit from out of town we always make sure to bring them here! Their duck fat Fries are a must! If you can find any extra room in your belly after dinner, their desserts are exceptional!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chancey C.,"Orlando, FL",12/22/2015,4.0,"I've heard lots of great things about Stock and Barrel, so I was excited to get to try it finally. I ended up having the classic bacon cheeseburger with onion rings. The burger was a good one, though slightly overlooked for medium, but still plenty juicy. All of the toppings were fresh, but the Bentons bacon stole the show. If you've never had it, it's by far the best bacon you can try! Overall, not a bad burger. What really blew my mind though was the onion rings. Hands down the BEST onion rings I've ever had. They were incredibly crispy, yet the onion was tender enough to easily bite through (with no pulling the whole onion out on the first bite)! They were seasoned well, and ultimately really impressed me. Overall this is a cool little place in Market Square that I would definitely recommend to others!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John Q.,"Charlotte, NC",10/8/2015,4.0,"Amazing burgers and great selection of bourbon. I physically can't bring myself to order anything other than the Hurt Locker with homemade pimento cheese and Benton's Bacon so my experiences are limited. But it is the best burger I've put in my mouth in this town by far. The place is a little small so be prepared to wait. I'd recommend putting your name in then walking around the corner to Sutrees to grab a beer. The staff are friendly and knowledgable. I had a bartender buy be two pours of some very fine bourbon after her shift one evening in response to the tip we left. Definitely check this place out. Occasionally the duck fries come out a little too saturated in fat, but that is my only nitpicking complaint about this place."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael M.,"Atlanta, GA",10/11/2015,5.0,"Best burger I've ever had. Perhaps the best fries ever as we'll, but without a doubt the best combo of burger and fries.  Swap in Bison and order the duck confit fries.   You won't be sorry."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Aaron J.,"Knoxville, TN",4/23/2016,5.0,"Go.  Just go.  Go.Burger, fries, shakes, whiskey, everything is amazing.  The atmosphere is awesome, but the space is small so there can be a wait, but it's well worth it. Always ask about the burger special for the day."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stephanie S.,"Johnson City, TN",12/16/2018,5.0,"This place has the best burgers I've ever had in my entire life! It's super small so there's probably always a wait, but it's more than worth the wait. I had the shroomin burger and it was phenomenal! The Mac & cheese was also delicious. The service wasn't the best, but with food that amazing I truly didn't even care about that. I'll travel an hour and a half to eat here anytime!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Erin C.,"Morrisville, NC",7/20/2016,5.0,"We were in the mood for a burger and stumbled upon this place in Market Square. We were on vacation and got seated right away around 5 pm on a Wednesday. I had the Billy burger with tomato jam, goat cheese, bacon, and bourbon onions. The heirloom tomato salad was also delicious. It was one of the top five favorite burgers I've ever had. My husband enjoyed the Hurtlocker with a fried green tomato, pimento cheese, and bacon. The duck fries were on point. The place is in Market square and has a decent amount of tables for the size of the restaurant. There is a large bar with a good selection of beer and bourbons. I imagine this place gets packed during busier hours but the food would definitely be worth the wait. The service was fast and friendly. We will be back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Julie S.,"Charlotte, NC",4/7/2016,4.0,"We had to wait a very long time, but it was nice they had a text system so we could wander around the square. Service wasn't too great, but the atmosphere and food was delicious. Highly recommend a burger and the smores milkshake."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2018,4.0,"This place is awesome.  I can't give it a 5 but a 4 from me is the standard I'd absolutely go here again.  I had a burger with a fried green tomato, pimento cheese, and a giant patty on it.  We also had fried green tomatoes with a balsamic reduction and really delicious goat cheese on top!  Everything tasted like it was cooked perfectly and then as an added touch, placed in a smoker for a while.  REALLY good!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Greg M.,"Knoxville, TN",12/10/2013,5.0,Extremely tasty burgers on good quality buns. Handcut fries. Very casual place is relaxing. Nice and warm on a cold night. What more do you need?
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jennifer G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/26/2018,4.0,"My favorite place for a burger. We went tonight for my birthday and it was as good as always! The Opa and fried pickles were great appetizers for the table. I had the Elvis burger which had Benton's bacon, peanut butter, and fried bananas on it. It was amazing!!! I usually get the Hurt Locker (burger with pimento cheese) but the Elvis is my new favorite for sure! Their onion rings are the best! The downside is how small the place is so it gets super loud with long wait times. Normally that's fine except it was raining tonight. There's hardly any room to stand inside so we had to wait outside in a doorway of another store. Our server was good but she was definitely rushed. We barely saw her and had to ask for tea refills and ice when she brought us hot tea. Overall it's still one of my favorite places to eat!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason L.,"Apalachicola, FL",1/25/2020,5.0,"This was a great place to come and enjoy some southern food, hospitality and drinks.

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Donna N.,"Sarasota, FL",9/15/2015,5.0,"I'm visiting Knoxville and a few people told me to check out this restaurant. I ordered a shot of Angel Envy bourdon over the rocks and The Billy burger with fries and onion rings. OMG...I'm in heaven! The bourbon was as smooth as silk. The burger was cooked to perfection, down to the homemade roll. The ingredients on the burger were to die for including: goat cheese, bourbon onions, tomato jam, and bacon. This is the BEST burger! Al the bartender / server was awesome too! He took great care of me and just a very cool guy. This establishment is great!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Aydan S.,"Bristol, CT",12/9/2019,5.0,Best burgers in market square. Cool spot with other good food and cold beer. Sat at the bar with some friends and had an awesome time the bartenders were great
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lee W.,"Nashville, TN",10/6/2019,5.0,"So glad we stopped by here on our way through Knoxville. We started with the Duck Fat Fries, which were wonderful. We also enjoyed the Black and Blue and Hurt Locker Burgers as well as the Chicken an Waffle. What a great meal with excellent service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Meena W.,"Knoxville, TN",12/6/2018,5.0,Truly sensational every time . Worth the time and money. We have never been disappointed or tried anything that wasn't just beyond delicious- both food and drinks! Staff is always courteous and attentive.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Hank M.,"Maryville, TN",4/21/2016,5.0,Amazing atmosphere and a great addition to Market Square. I tried the PB&J Shake and one of the burgers. I will be back for sure!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Desarae J.,"Lake Bluff, IL",6/24/2018,5.0,Absolutely amazing food!!! I had the Farmhouse burger with Duck confit fries. Will not disappoint. Best burger I've had in a while.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2015,2.0,"First of all, I am a burger fiend. I never turn away a great cheeseburger. So, I was so excited to get to try this place when they first opened. 1. The wait is insane. If you are planning to go on a weekend night, you might as well get there at 4:00 or 5:00 so you can actually eat at ""dinner time."" They don't take reservations or call aheads either. 2. Why is it hot as hades in this place? Both times I have been, it was during the summer, so I understand it's hot. However, when its 95 degrees outside and practically 80 in the restaurant, it makes eating hot food somewhat miserable. 3. I just don't get the hype. The menu is large and they are definitely creative with their burgers, but for me, it's always just been ""meh."" I have had a multitude of burgers in my life in and out of Knoxville and wouldn't even put this on my list of best burgers. I expected some amazing beef, but felt it didn't have that much flavor. It's great they use local products and the atmosphere is cool, kinda hipster, but I just can't get into it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Peter U.,"Knoxville, TN",5/17/2019,1.0,"Waiting for table and people walk-in we're getting tables before us. They said they have 3 different waiting list. We were only two people, but they first sat a two top that just walked in ahead of us. Figured it was just a mistake, because someone was filling for the hostess. But when they say a 3 top that had just walked in and said they had 3 wait list, we were finished. Putting a 2 people on a 4 top is standard. Making 2 tops wait for 30 minutes when you have open tables for others means you should seat everyone. Worked in the restaurant industry for years. That's a little ridiculous. We usually eat here a couple times but most likely not r"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessica R.,"Knoxville, TN",11/5/2015,4.0,"I had their black and blue burger and it was really good. Their blue cheese sauce was amazing on it! They have an ok beer selection, but not really impressive. They do however have an out of this world whiskey selection! Seriously anything that you could want. They space is pretty tight packed and a little loud."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alexa N.,"Jamestown, NC",8/23/2015,5.0,"The food is AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Definitely one of the best burgers I have had. We got the spicy crab dip, pimento cheese app, and the mushroom app and all tasted amazing and were big sharable portions. We had a party of 11 so we sent some people ahead to get our name on the wait list with no problem. Pictured is the Smores milkshake which you have to get if you go. For 11 picky adults there was not a single complaint. Definitely come hungry!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vincyl F.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",11/25/2019,5.0,"Do not let the dark environment fool you: This place has the best fries, burgers and whiskey in market square. The duck fat fries and mother clucker sandwich are to die for! I would bet my 401K on that. It's only got 100 bucks in it but that could a lot of good food at stock and barrel. Grab a beer, relax with friends and enjoy a lively atmosphere here. You won't regret it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley T.,"Knoxville, TN",8/26/2013,5.0,"I had the best experience at the new Stock & Barrel this weekend for lunch.  We started with the spicy crab dip, and gobbled it up! Just enough heat, and unique from others in town.  For lunch, I had the quinoa veggie burger.  It had great grill flavor, and was light yet filling, which is exactly what I hoped for.  Instead of fries on the side, I opted for the black bean corn salad, which paired perfectly, and a generous portion. My friend had the Village salad, which was beautiful to the eye, and abundant in veggies and feta! She said the dressing was light and didn't ever power the fresh flavors.  We decided to treat ourselves to a bourbon fizz, why not?   It was refreshing and unique.  Not being a huge bourbon fan myself, I was unsure if I'd enjoy, but it was very yummy fresh tasting. Our service was prompt, and all of our questions were answered.   Having restaurant server experience myself, I know how hectic opening a new spot can be, but none of that was obvious to us in the least. The decor is cool and rustic, and the bar is amazing!! The lights, the wood, the artwork, it all works together and creates the perfect environment to relax and enjoy some amazing food and drinks.  We will be back for sure, you should check it out for yourself!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Penne H.,"Knoxville, TN",12/21/2015,5.0,"OMG... Where to start! I've yet to be disappointed. Duck Confit fries are to die for. Ask for extra extra crispy & crunch to your hearts content! The Elk burger on weekends or the Lamb burger anytime. If they don't have your whisky, bourbon, or Scotch, you just don't need it LOL!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Veronica W.,"Charlotte, NC",7/16/2016,5.0,"If your a burger connoisseur a must in Knoxville.  We have been to more than our share of burger joint looking to the best ever. And this was it! The one with crispy onion rings, bacon and a fried egg was TOTALLY worth the mess.  If you have to wait when you get there... wait. It's worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nate S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/16/2016,5.0,"As much as I hate myself for coming here for the duck fries, I have to admit, they are delicious. Be forewarned as you will feel guilty as the abundant amounts of grease and fat drips down your chin while you bury your face in the delicious fries. I come here mainly for those greasy fries. The burgers that accompanies them are regular burgers. Nothing spectacular or amazing, but the fries make it worthwhile. There is usually a long wait if you come during high traffic times like weekends so be prepared to wait."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Crystal L.,"Owingsville, KY",5/1/2018,4.0,"Went for dinner last night. Food was good. I had a chicken sandwich and onion rings. The onion rings were fantastic. The chicken sandwich was a little tough and dry. I think it may have been slightly over cooked.  The overall seating is the type I don't like as they have one big long bench and several tables are pulled up to the bench. The tables are really close together to. I am traveling for work so I was out by myself, but felt like I sitting on top of the party next to my table since they were so close."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Courtney H.,"Searcy, AR",1/3/2019,5.0,"We came here and only got appetizers and a couple milkshakes and it was great! The service was quick, our servers were very friendly, and the prices were good for a downtown restaurant!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Randall M.,"Strawberry Plains, TN",1/2/2020,3.0,"This was my first visit with my son. Busy place for a Monday afternoon, I thought. Server was very nice and busy. She took our drink order.   Soon she brought our drinks and we placed a lunch order. After waiting a bit, I got up and asked another server for straws, napkins, forks, knives, and napkins. along with salt and pepper so I was able to get our table set up for success. We needed a drink refill but went without since our server seemed to be very busy elsewhere. The food came and the onion rings would have been great if they would have been hot. same with the fries. Sandwiches were really good. Pricey for what we got. We left a 20% tip but it really should have been much less due to the service we failed to receive. My son was responsible because he always gives at least 20% gratuity but I think the tip is deserving of the service received, I will be back but will be much more verbal as to what my needs are instead of taking it upon myself to wait on myself. Atmosphere and music, ambience and lighting, plus cleanliness were good and cosy."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chris M.,"Matthews, NC",7/9/2018,5.0,"One of the best hamburgers I have had anyplace, a must stop if driving thru Knoxville.  The fries are amazing as are the onion rings, try the chicken waffle sandwich."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,George C.,"Summerland Key, FL",8/9/2019,5.0,"If you're a bourbon or whiskey drinker, this is the place to go to. The food is good and the drinks are some of the best I've had!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stella Z.,"Seattle, WA",10/28/2017,5.0,"I'm not a burger person, but when other yelpers claim it to be the best burger in the US, I have to give it a try. I ordered bison and my husband got hurt locker. They are truly gourmet burgers, pretty delicious in my opinion. I can't call them the best because I enjoy simple burgers off the backyard grill and don't often order it in the restaurant. My husband thinks it's the best burger he ever had. Highly recommend if you are a burger fan."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tara G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/4/2015,4.0,The food is five stars. I've tried 6 different burgers here and loved them all. The pimento cheese dip is the best I've had in Knoxville and the duck confit fries we had today are equally amazing. The food is so good I've never even tried a milkshake here. I always vow at the beginning of the meal to try one but then I'm so full with great burgers that I never order the milkshake but they sound delicious. Service is way better than when they first opened. Now they are probably one of the better waitstaffs in Knoxville. I do have to take one star off for the fact that the bench seating is very uncomfortable. Service is slow but worth it. They need a larger space and better seating to get that fifth star!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tara G.,"Knoxville, TN",1/24/2015,4.0,"We came here last year and the food was good but our server was horrible. We knew it was just that one server and came back with friends tonight. Our server tonight was Hunter and he was superb, good attitude, attentive, made lots of small talk. We did have a long wait to sit and food did take awhile so I definitely recommend coming with a good conversationalist. But in the end all worth it. Everyone loved their burgers and apps (pimento cheese was very tasty!) and we all loved our Bourbon Fizzes. Glad tonight's experience was a total redemption of our first visit!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian S.,"Memphis, TN",3/8/2016,5.0,"Great place to grab a bite with you, your friends, and/or your family. Lots of delicious sounding burgers from which to choose. I had The Billy burger and the combination of onions and jam was outstanding. The Mac and cheese was good also. The place is small and cozy, but is jumping with lots of energy. Although we didn't partake at the time, the list of whiskeys they sell is huge. My son had the Nutella milkshake and it was the bomb. My wife and I split the peanut butter pie and it was good too."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Zackery V.,"Knoxville, TN",5/14/2018,4.0,"Food is amazing, drink menu is nice. There's literally something there for anybody. Only negative thing I have to say is that the tables are a little too close together so time and and the person beside me hit elbows a few times. Other than that, you should definitely check this place out if you're on a splurge night."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Richard V.,"Huntsville, AL",9/8/2018,1.0,"We checked in ahead via yelp, 50 minute wait. Ok, home game but we left at half time. Checked in with the hostess and she confirmed the same wait time was still accurate. 1hr and 26 minutes later we still had another party ahead. We went down the street since it was 85+ degrees inside stock & barrel after waiting so long with no table...."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matt G.,"Columbus, OH",8/22/2015,4.0,"We swung by this little gem while visiting and MAN I wished we would have eaten dinner here!The burgers looked and sounded absolutely amazing! We came for after dinner drinks and I was blown away by the Whiskey selection. They are very attentive and friendly. Not too mention, their adult milkshakes are PHENOMENAL!The layout is pretty cool and prices are reasonable. This is a must stop if you are in Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah D.,"Philadelphia, PA",11/9/2018,5.0,"My absolute FAVORITE burger place in Knoxville and one of my favorite restaurants. If you're not a Knoxville native and looking for a good place to eat, definitely check this place out. You won't be disappointed."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michelle R.,"Hunter Mill, VA",6/24/2019,5.0,Best burger I have had in a long time! It was perfectly seasoned and cooked the way I wanted. I chose the normal burger with cheese and it is pretty big. It came with fries that reminded me of five guy style fries. The drinks were great too. I wish I lived closer to Knoxville so I could go more often. Definitely check it out! Cheers!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mark M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",6/19/2018,5.0,Awesome burgers and great spot..Burger was huge and couldn't finish it.Beer and bourbon selection was massive for a small place like this.I'll be back.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah G.,"Austin, TX",8/21/2017,5.0,"Sat outside at the stock and barrel and had the billy and bison burger. When I tell you these burgers were amazing, I mean amazing. I'm not a huge burger person but after trying the billy, I will definitely take that burger comment back. The billy had tomato jam, goat cheese, and caramelized onions, which melted together into a fabulous mouthful of flavors.  I will definitely crave the billy over and over again. Come here if you are in Knoxville and want to go to burger heaven!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Erin M.,"Bristol, TN",10/22/2017,4.0,Took some ladies here for a bachlorette party. It was fun people watching from the patio. The service was alright. The burgers were fantastic and juicy. But those sweet potato fries!!! They were phenomenal! I highly recommend trying some top shelf whiskey while you're there too!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/25/2015,5.0,"Stock & Barrel is the go-to place in Knoxville for great burgers.  When people come in from out of town we usually take them to Stock & Barrel and to see Market Square, and when they come back to visit they always want to go again.  If you're a bourbon lover, this is also the place for you as they have a huge selection. A few tips - you have to try the Duck Confit fries.  They are wonderful and not something you can get just anywhere.  They come in a big portion with your burger though - so often one of us will get the duck fries and another the onion rings because they are amazing as well.If you like fried eggs, definitely go for the Farm House.  I also love the Black & Bleu or anything with the Garlic Aioli.One last tip - there is usually a wait but now they are on an app that can get you in line ahead of time called NoWait.  We normally put our names in on the app when we leave the house and then can go right in when we get there.  You can also put your name in once you arrive and then walk around Market Square - they will text you when your table is ready so that gives you the freedom to go wherever."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lars D.,"Raleigh, NC",5/20/2015,5.0,"Simply excellent in all areas.  Service at the bar was great, delicious food, and a huge selection of whiskey.  I had a burger and a whiskey flight and enjoyed it immensely.  The Tomato Salad side is also great, highly recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tom R.,"Danbury, CT",7/26/2019,4.0,"Drove 12 hours from CT to TN for a family wedding, checked into our downtown hotel and decided to walk over to Market Square for supper. My sister recommended this place, so we stopped in. This was a Wednesday night and it was packed. But the hostess said we had timed it right because a couple of tables were turning over. A very young -- and loud -- crowd but that's to be expected in a lively college town. I liked it. Got seated and waiter was attentive and explained this was a whiskey bar and reviewed some choices. Then he helped us with questions about their tantalizing menu of burgers. Nicely done. We ordered and asked that our burgers be served bun less. Not a problem. Burger was spot on, as were the rings. As I ate I was able to get caught up on the baseball scores from the TV that was on. A fun experience. I was amazed at the size of the crowd midweek. We probably finished up around 9 and as we left there was a line at the door. They're doing a lot of things right."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christine D.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",11/2/2019,5.0,Best burger I've had in a long time.  Cooked perfectly.   The Hurt Locker was a great way to sample the fried green tomatoes and pimiento cheese.  Huge onion rings as a side.  Would definitely come back! (Ate so fast didnt get pics lol)
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Morgan H.,"Chattanooga, TN",9/7/2015,5.0,"Great old fashioned, ordered the bison burger medium rare and duck fat fried fries. Garlic aioli comes with to dip fries in and the bun is outsourced from a local bakery"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany E.,"Austin, TX",10/31/2019,5.0,Our favorite date night spot. Consistently great food. The pimento cheese is my fave!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael W.,"Knoxville, TN",11/22/2017,4.0,"Beer, Bourbon, burgers, and (amazingly) some of the best milkshakes around! Burgers are huge, fries are just that right balance of crispy and greasy, fantastic bourbon selection, pretty great brew selection on tap. All in a casual saloon style environment in a charming location. But blink and you will miss it (and be sorry), storefront has a narrow profile."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lisa W.,"Chicago, IL",4/17/2016,5.0,"So good. Go here, get a $5 milkshake and splurge on the the duck confit fries. Don't count calories and just enjoy the party in your mouth!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael N.,"Nashville, TN",2/15/2018,4.0,"Stopped in and tried the Farmhouse Burger. Any place that uses Benton's bacon obviously is using good ingredients and you can taste the difference. Add an egg and that would be enough, but the locally made buns really set this apart. Only negative was the order was medium well but it was very pink throughout, more medium rare. Worth going out of the way for."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Justin A.,"Indianapolis, IN",2/16/2016,5.0,"One a cold snowy day in Knoxville, my friend and I decided to stop here for lunch. I ordered the farmhouse burger and a beer. My friend got the fried green tomatoes. All were absolutely delicious. I got my burger medium well and it was cooked spot on. The burger had a good touch of seasoning and the fried egg added the perfect touch of yolky-ness. The fries were a perfect golden brown and not too salty. The service and staff were great."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jh A.,"Asheville, NC",3/14/2016,3.0,"I came in on a Friday evening and was told their was a THREE hour wait. I skipped it that night, and I came back on a weekday for lunch soon after. I'm not generally impressed by burger bars, but Stock & Barrel offers unique options and I appreciate the whiskey variety here. That said, I don't think it is special enough to wait too long for-- try it out for a weekday lunch for a nice meal and no wait."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John D.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2015,5.0,"Food - delicious! Started with the fried green tomato appetizer and it was amazeballs. Perfectly crispy with a balsamic glaze and goat cheese crumble. Then had the bison burger with duck confiet fries...shamalamadingdong, it was delicious!!!Drink - solid beer selection. Do you also like bourbon? Good, they have a bajillion to choose from. Bottomine, get here!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Marcus B.,"Benton, KY",10/26/2018,5.0,"Bourbon selection is phenomenal!! Great bartenderete's are beautiful and friendly. Hats off and glasses up to great food, drinks and atmosphere."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alexander W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/5/2015,5.0,"Really good food and really good service, what more can you ask for? I've ordered the Opa! and Pimiento cheese dip for apps, both were AWESOME. The Bison burger is honestly one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Also tried the Ring of Fire with their veggie burger instead of beef, which was so deliciously spicy. Just make sure that you're ready to wait if you get there during peak hours!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lori C.,"Spring Hill, TN",5/25/2018,5.0,"It's been two years since the first time we were here. Our memory was spot on. All three of us had a different burger, black and blue, the Bernie and the classic burger. All three of us agree it's the best burger we've ever had. Fries were amazing as well. Love this place, atmosphere, staff and food! All Amazing!! I don't give many reviews, but this place  is Delicious!! I wish they had one in Nashville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brent F.,"Knoxville, TN",3/23/2015,3.0,"There's a long list of delicious burgers in Knoxville, and Stock and Barrel sits firmly near the top. All kinds of scrumptious morsels of varying sorts. You really can't go wrong. The atmosphere is cool, and when the weather is warm, the patio can't be beat for people watching. So Brent, why only three stars? I'll tell you, the milkshake menu is extensive and SOUNDS mind blowing. The reality? SUPER UNDERWHELMING. In fact, I've had two different milkshakes on two different occasions, and both were... VERY wet. What I mean by that is that it was like sweet milk with debris floating in it, as if it sat on top of the microwave and somebody forgot about it. Now I know you're probably asking why I didn't say anything about it to the server. I actually did. She was very apologetic, and offered to make me another one, so I took her up on it. She brought back what could've been the exact same milkshake. A few minutes later, she came back to make sure I was more satisfied. When I told her it was exactly the same, she leaned in and in a hushed tone told me that the manager makes them skimp on ice cream and that they'd get in trouble if they used too much. WOW.OK, so there's plenty of great stuff on the menu, but steer clear of the milkshakes. I'm more upset that they'd rather turn out marginal milkshakes than make a customer happy. I've learned my lesson though. TL;dr Burgers are tasty as they come. Milkshakes are an illusion. The management is cheap. People watching is top notch. I can rant endlessly about the temperature of milk."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bob L.,"Issaquah, WA",11/29/2017,4.0,Enjoyable setting. The fried mushrooms were fabulous. Principally a burger place and limited other menu options. Burgers slightly above average. Excellent service.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ankita S.,"Richardson, TX",5/12/2018,4.0,Nice place for a fine collection of whiskey and food!!! Location is great at the market square and if you are lucky you will get seating early but I highly recommend making a reservation. The burger and fries portion was big and the drink was awesome!!! Would definitely recommend this place
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joey D.,"Knoxville, TN",3/21/2015,4.0,"Ah, Stock & Barrel........ I try not to go here very often because every time I do, I consume 3 - 4 days worth of calories. The burgers are delightful and the beers flow with vengeance and grace. The prices aren't bad either. Not the cheapest, but certainly reasonable. I noticed last night that they had a decent looking cocktail menu too, which I guess I had never noticed. I have to tell you about this burger though. I got the 'special' burger for the evening. It was a gyro burger, so it was a burger patty, topped with sliced lamb, hosed in tsatziki (sp?) sauce, and served in na'an bread with Mediterranean fixin's. It was seriously a religious experience. Two thumbs up, up, up. I meant to take a picture but I think blacked out during the whole experience."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Victoria P.,"Nashville, TN",5/10/2016,4.0,Tried the Bernie and the Hurt Locker. Bernie had a great taste tho my personal fave was hurt locker. The sauce on it had a great taste. This restaurant had a cool relaxed vibe.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tamara C.,"Knoxville, TN",10/17/2018,4.0,"Some of the best burgers and fries I've ever had! Sometimes the wait can be super long but if you check in on Yelp when you're a mile away, it seems to help a lot. You can always run next door to grab a drink while you wait or visit some of the nearby shops on market square."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John M.,"Knoxville, TN",8/14/2019,5.0,"In today's gourmet burger world too often the burger is so disappointing.  Not at Stock and Barrel. I ate there twice when I was in Knox to drop my son off at college and have to say it served, by far, the best burger I have ever eaten.  I Love burgers and fries and have eaten them around the world, including at the Hotel Ritz in Paris, where the burger is truffle infused.  Regardless, Stock and Barrel's has a delicious, juicy flavor and its duck confit fries are crazy good.  The meal is heavy, so eat light, or not at all before going, but you won't regret this burger.  Excellent food with fast, very friendly service.  Yum!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Justin W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/10/2017,4.0,"As far as burger places go, this one is unique. Their huge whiskey selection and weird burger toppings (peanut butter, goat cheese, etc.) make it one of my favorites. The price is on the high side, but it's worth it. This would be perfect for special occasions were it not for the small size leading to absurd wait times (upwards of 1 hour is not uncommon). Overall a good experience, just call ahead to make sure they can seat you."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelly R.,"Corral de Tierra, CA",10/14/2019,5.0,"BEST BURGER I've ever had! Stopped by Stock and Barrel while in town with recommendations from our hotel. The concierge hit the nail on the head. We ordered Duck Fat fries, fried pickles, black and blue burger and a farmhouse burger. The servings were HUGE! Our servers Josh and Will provided us with the best customer service and made great recommendations. They were awesome! I would ask to sit in their section again in a heartbeat. Only negative of the night was that our entree came out 5 minutes after our appetizers so it was hard keeping everything warm to enjoy. We hope to be back!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Teresa P.,"Seymour, TN",7/5/2019,5.0,"Love this place!! Local and delicious!! My favorite is the bison burger w duck fries!! If you go early, the wait is not bad at all!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeremy W.,"Andover, KS",3/12/2018,5.0,"This place was amazing, they had great service, a great whisky selection, and the food was worth every penny. If you live in Knoxville and haven't had this place YOU ARE MISSING OUT. Probably the best burger I've ever had!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mark R.,"Garland, TX",11/28/2015,4.0,"Parking can be a problem in downtown Knoxville, this is a great hamburger joint where it is OK to order medium rare.  They have one with an egg on it, which I tried, it was good.  I preferred there Classic Bacon Burger, my favorite and the Farmhouse, I preferred the Classic Bacon Burger, medium rare. I tried their fried green tomatoes, be care they are really hot when first served, however; it didn't have much taste to it.  The hamburger comes with fries and they were fine.  It is a great burger joint, kind of noisy.  They have a text message seating system which worked well."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kari C.,"Collierville, Memphis, TN",4/26/2016,4.0,"To begin with, the atmosphere here is incredible! I went with my boyfriend for lunch after hearing how amazing this place was, my boyfriend loved his burger her ordered.I on the other hand tend to be a picky eater and I got the bacon burger, something about the bacon they use tasted chemically to me and my top bun was raw in the center, the waiter fixed my bun by grabbing me another one, but by that time my appetite was lost.The service was great and maybe I just got the one bad burger because everyone else loves there food! I am for sure going to go back to give them another chance soon and order something without the bacon."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dimitra S.,"Rockford, TN",4/14/2015,5.0,"If you love burgers this is your place. We have eaten here several times and are never disappointed. The atmosphere is fun, very small, and tonight's waiter- Hunter- was especially exceptional. Try the Billy burger, the elk burger and definitely the duck confit fries."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael P.,"Knoxville, TN",5/31/2017,1.0,"Rarely, If ever, do I go onto a local business page and give them a bad review, but in this case I must. I had heard so many great reviews about this establishment that I had really built myself up for it. When My Mother and I had went back n March, the restaurant was under construction for floor damages. We were downtown today so we decided to finally give it a try. Immediately, I noticed that the seating arrangement was incredibly close so I asked the Hostess to please seat my Mother and I somewhere away from people. She passed not one, but TWO, two top tables and sat us at what felt like a feeding trought for humans. No one was on either side of us, but soon came other people. I opted to choose the uncomfortable Metal chair (No cushioning) thinking that the wooden bench (also not cushioned) might be more comfortable for my Mother. It wasn't apparently.Then we were approached by Devon, who has to be the ABSOLUTE worst waiter in the history of the profession. Since it was lunch and because we had heard the portions were so big, my Mother and I decided to split an appetizer and a burger and to get a side of Onion rings as well. Upon ordering the ""shared"" meal Devon physically rolled his eyes as if we were going to be one of ""those tables who didn't tip"". Needless to say we didn't see Devon again until the end of our meal. For an appetizer my Mother and I had the Fried Green Tomatoes which were absolutely delicious. At this point we still had a bit of hope.They were brought to us by what I assume to be the food runner, Al. Al was incredibly professional and polite and basically our waiter from then on because Devon was no where to be seen, Our main course arrived, nearly 45 minutes later, by the very courteous food runner by the name of Al. This where hope faded... The Fries were burnt and in tiny pieces as if they were bits from the bottom of the basket that had been sitting there for the entire 45 minutes that we had been there. The ""Bernie"" Burger was overcooked and dry and sloppily put together. The Benton Bacon was burnt and my Mother only had two bites of her half. The Onion rings were hot, fresh and quite good. Not seeing Devon, who was nowhere to be found, I asked the waitress who was serving beside us if she could please tell our waiter that we would like refills for our Sodas. Five minutes later Devon appears with Two drinks, no ice, and in PLASTIC cups! Since there was no telling when I would see Devon again I asked for the check. The check was $35. We got a to go box, as I always do in Market Square, and gave it to a homeless man. Overall summary... DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!! Quick mention, the Art that decorated the walls was incredible!!! Kudos to the artist!!! Unfortunately no one I asked seemed to know who painted them."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tiara T.,"Maryville, TN",10/10/2019,5.0,This is my favorite place to eat when we come to downtown Knoxville! I always get the ring of fire burger and it's the best thing I've ever tasted!! Try it- you'll like it if you like your food with a little fiery kick! The duck fries are also amazing dipped in their signature garlic aioli sauce!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cherie O.,"Saint Louis, MO",3/1/2015,3.0,"I fail to see what the fuss is all about. If their food blows every other Knoxville burger out of the water, Knoxville restaurants are in a sorry state, indeed.This has been on my list for quite some time, ever since they were featured on tv. We found ourselves hungry in Knoxville running errands, so I convinced the man that despite the fact that Stock and Barrel does not take reservations, it was the place to eat. It was high on the list because it locally sources, which is a big plus in my book.It was a 30 minute wait for tables on a rainy Sunday afternoon at around 3 PM. There was available seating at the bar, so we did that instead. It took awhile to be noticed by the two bartenders, and a list of specials never came. Reading the reviews, I think it would have been great to try the elk burger special, but it's okay...maybe the bartenders do not note the specials to their patrons. There really is an extensive selection of bourbon, whiskey, and beer. Too bad alcohol was not on our agenda this time, but it is quite a comprehensive and interesting list. He got the Steakhouse burger, which consists of horseradish cheddar, steak sauce, crispy onions, and mushrooms...without the mushrooms and had onion rings instead of the fries. He liked it. It was a pretty solid dish...I was impressed by the fact that he ordered it medium well...and it still had some juice and taste to it (I kinda like my meats to still be just on the verge of mooing). I ordered the bison burger medium rare, which included Crimini, Shiitake, and Button Mushrooms, Bourbon Cheese, Crispy Onions, and Garlic Aioli, served with Duck Confit Fries. To someone who's never really had this stuff before, it's a good dish. It's fresh. But...my burger only had button mushrooms...none of the Crimini or Shiitake...which disappointed me because the contrasting delicate tastes of the three would have been amazing. (Also, side note: you guys might want to take a look at your online menu: shiitake is not spelled shitake, and grimini may be crimini). The bourbon cheese tasted like melted blue cheese without any bourbon taste...but like really good blue cheese. And the garlic aioli was more suited for the fries instead of the burger itself. The meat was good...but the supporting cast combination disappointed. It's a good burger...but it's not the best burger I've ever had. The biggest disappointment though was the duck confit fries. They were a salty mess. Most of the fries were in one inch pieces, which were much better eaten with a fork than with my fingers. They were greasy and salty, and I found myself dipping them in the aioli to cut down on the taste of salt. It was almost like i got the bottom of the barrel. Not much duck taste...just lots of grease and salt. Yeah, good duck confit fries are nowhere like that hot mess I got. I like the purse hooks under the bar; it's de rigueur nowadays...although I didn't like the fact that there was spilled alcohol over the dirty floor which gave me second thought to having my crossbody purse resting on top of it. It's a small place...so it's crowded and loud. Love the fact that ingredients are locally sourced, but you can't just plop them together, copy some other food trends, and call it gourmet."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Caroline C.,"Charleston, SC",11/24/2017,5.0,"OH. MY. GOSH. We ate here on our way back to Charleston and the food was SO good. We got fried pickles and fried mushrooms as an appetizer. Holy crap the mushrooms were SO good. The honey sounded weird with mushrooms, but I couldn't get enough! The pickles were also good, but the shrooms...those were the shrooms of my dreams. We both had burgers, of course. I had the bison burger (again more mushrooms 3 DIFFERENT KINDS!). It was one of the best burgers I've had. My partner had the farmhouse and she said it was VERY good. The duck fat fries were SO good. I've had duck fat fries before and these did not disappoint. We also got a smores milkshake to share and it came out with a burning marshmallow. It was perfection. Aside from the amazing food, the concept is very cool. Burgers and bourbon. Their bourbon selection is great. If you like your bourbon with ice, it comes out with one large sphere icecube, which is cool. I will definitely be back here!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ebahi E.,"Columbus, OH",4/21/2016,4.0,Bison burger was juicy as described. The blue cheese and fried onions on top really was a satisfying eat. The fries was topped with cheese and chives. All served with Spicy garlic aioli that reminds me of the dipping sauce you have at Japanese steakhouses. The negative- this place had a lot going   For it until I realized the other dipping sauce was plain ketchup. Come on mix it with something.... Anything
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kari H.,"Oliver Springs, TN",10/8/2017,5.0,"This is the best place to get a burger in Knoxville. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've tried several different burgers and they're all amazing, with the Billy being one of my favorites. The Greek burger is a close runner up. They have a great selection of bourbons as well, which you can't pass up! A+ food and service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chup K.,"Raleigh, NC",8/9/2015,5.0,"Seriously good burgers. I got the Billy, which did not skimp on the goat cheese. The duck fat fries were amazing. But seriously the best thing was the smores shake. Definitely need to come early, it's a small place with a long wait if you come after 5:30 on the weekends. But it's in a cute market square area and they text you when your table is ready, so the wait went fast while going through some of the local boutiques."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Justin C.,"Houston, TX",6/29/2018,5.0,"Passing through Knoxville on Vacay with my Gal and this place popped up on Yelp highly rated. Man!! What a great little place. Burgers are Rich, Gourmet and FULL of Flavor! My Gal had the Farm House which was on point. Their standard fries are great! For myself I ordered The Bison! It tasted exactly how it should have and more! Their Duct Fries were delicious! Had some craft beers as well! The Dirty Bastard and Kentucky Bourbon Ale! Great little spot to step in and grab a bite or chill and have a few rounds! Don't just pass by if you have an Appetite!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lois S.,"Keene, NH",6/29/2018,5.0,"The food was amazing (gluten free buns) and the staff was super friendly. Highly recommend, we will be back!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Benjamin M.,"Miami, FL",1/12/2016,5.0,"Great place to stop and have a few drinks while walking on Market Square in Knoxville, TN. I was really impressed with the variety of drinks on the menu. I especially loved that they had a large selection of whiskeys to choose from. Another thing that I liked was that they also serve food. I tried one of their appetizers and was very satisfied. Great place to hang out and have a good time."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Marisa L.,"Nashville, TN",1/22/2018,5.0,"Great burgers with a wide selection of toppings, yummy grilled chicken sandwich, and excellent cocktails. A fun atmosphere. Friendly staff and excellent service to boot! Will be back..."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lyle B.,"Port Orange, FL",7/29/2015,5.0,"Really? A 4-1/2 star burger place? Had to try it out. They were wrong. Nothing to complain about here. Should be 5 stars!Sat at the bar. Great service. Enjoyed the fried green tomatoes. Had feta cheese on top. Interesting idea and actually very tasty. Moved on to the Bison mushroom burger. Cooked perfectly and again, very tasty. Comes with Duck Confit fries. Well, they were excellent. Only caveat is we went in at 7pm and they had a 40 minute wait. Fortunately there were two two seats at the bar that we quickly snagged. So, that's my tip. Check the bar for quick seats if you're in a hurry. Lots of other eateries and pubs in this area as well. Great place to check out."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amy D.,"Dayton, OH",4/4/2018,5.0,"Unbelievable fried green tomatoes, mushrooms, onion rings and fries. Hamburgers were awesome! Even the black bean burger was extraordinary!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ken S.,"Louisville, KY",2/16/2018,4.0,I couldn't decide on a burger so I went with a classic bacon chz.. great burger and fries were hot! Parking on a Friday is not free.. and you might as well go to a garage. I regret sitting outside.. the homeless are abundant and obnoxiously loud.. sit inside.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian P.,"Knoxville, TN",6/10/2017,5.0,A little bit of a wait but wellll worth it . Best burger in town and i love that they buy local .
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Libby G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/24/2015,5.0,"Best burgers in Knoxville, hands down. Other places may throw a fried egg on a burger and try to compete, but they can't - Stock & Barrel's burgers just can't be beat (and yes, I'm apparently writing rhyming reviews now). I remember going to Market Square one night last winter and it was pouring rain with a half foot of slush on the ground from a big snow the night before...truly gross out. Every restaurant on the square was dead except for the Stock & Barrel, which had a wait even! That says a lot. You can't go wrong with the Farmhouse or the Hurt Locker. If you are adventurous, you gotta try the Elvis. I know it sounds odd (peanut butter, fried bananas & bacon on a burger), but it is seriously delicious and not something you can get anywhere else. The fries are great but I personally am obsessed with the onion rings - best ones I've ever had! Great flavor and the batter isn't too thick. Lately, my go-to is the 'Merican burger: American cheese, homemade pickles, onions, tomato, greens, and mayo (which is also homemade and flippin' GOOD). Its so simple and so delicious. Really shows how quality all the ingredients are when the burger without all the bells and whistles is one of my favorites!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",6/20/2015,4.0,Also: the Bernie when available and the Kentucky bourbon barrel ale really top off those duck fries. I always go for the fries.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",7/14/2014,5.0,"MAKE SURE YOU GET THE DUCK CONFIT FRIES!  You can get them as a side with your burger for a 2.50 upcharge.  (Totally worth it!)  Please don't visit knoxville without eating here. And if you're a local and haven't been, GO TONIGHT.  So delicious.  I haven't met a burger I didn't like here but I especially enjoy the elk, steakhouse, and mother clucker.  I also enjoy the wedge salad when I'm not in the mood for a burger.  The seared tuna burger is AMAZING when available."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason H.,"Knoxville, TN",4/21/2015,5.0,"I am raising my review based on how the owner handled our previous visit, and how our experience was the second time we visited. After reading my review, the owner reached out to me personally, apologized, and gave us a gift certificate so we could try them again. He made no mention of reviewing them again or anything, it was just an apologetic gesture. He even asked us to describe the waiter so he could take corrective action. The second time we visited was a much better experience. We had ordered take out. As soon as I walked in, they lead me to the bar where they had my food ready. The bartender was polite and we had a friendly conversation as he rang up my order. The hostesses opened the door for me on the way out, smiled, and wished me to have a good day. Everyone was friendly, and the food was still amazing!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason H.,"Knoxville, TN",3/21/2015,2.0,"The food? Amazing. Probably the best burger I have ever had.  No joke. The. Best. Atmosphere? Okay, but cramped. Also, very loud. I could barely hear the person sitting across from me at my table. Loved the brick walls, the lighting, and the decor, however. Bathrooms? Dirty. The staff? Here we come to the reason for my low rating. The waiter was one of the worst I've ever had at any restaurant. We walk in, carrying our 10-month-old, and the waiter doesn't even ask us if we want a high chair. After we ordered our drinks, we asked for a high chair. The waiter literally rolled his eyes and sighed, and without a word he walked away and grabbed a high chair for us.After he finally came to take our food order, we almost never saw him again. I think only one of us ever got a refill the entire meal. We had to flag him down and stop him from walking by us to ask for some extra napkins, which resulted in more rolled eyes and sighs. It's a shame, really. This had the potential to be one of our favorite restaurants, but now we will likely never visit again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vanessa G.,"Santa Ana, CA",2/6/2018,4.0,"Had the veggie burger, it was really good. Fries were just whatever though, next time I'll probably go for the onion rings."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jerry E.,"Knoxville, TN",3/12/2017,1.0,I have tried very hard to like your Restaurant but I think you employ some of the ruidest people ever!!!    Your Front desk and Bartenders are not very customer oriented!!!  Two of the most valuable positions in your company... NOT Good!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,JL C.,"Knoxville, TN",11/29/2017,3.0,"Listened to all the hype, and I've eaten here twice. I am just NOT impressed. The place is TINY & you're packed in like sardines...I was honestly 6 inches or less from the woman sitting at the next table. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I'd been drinking. Idk. Service was awful the first time, much better the second visit. Food: large variety of burgers...lots of different toppings. Tasty, but I don't like a burger so big & sloppy that I needed a knife and fork to even eat it...both times. Cutting it in half didn't help. If you like big sloppy burgers, you'll probably love this place! The fries cooked in duck fat were great. Will I go back? No. Just hate feeling like a sardine and sloppy burgers...even if they're tasty!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Steve C.,"Spring Hill, TN",5/25/2018,5.0,This was our second time in. We remembered it as the best burger we ever had.  This visit did not disappoint. Stock and Barrel are the reigning Ultimate Burger Chamion of the World
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany W.,"Athens, TX",3/12/2018,3.0,The atmosphere was cool. I'm glad we came at lunch. It wouldn't have been a place to take kids for dinner. I was very excited to try the burger but it fell flat. The bun was soggy in places and the meat fell apart. The flavor itself was good but it was very hard to eat. They also have sweet pickles which I don't like so that was disappointing The selection of drinks was great.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ben O.,"Knoxville, TN",3/15/2015,5.0,"This is my favorite burger place.  Try the Hurt Locker or the Salmon Burger.  Their beef is fresh tasting, the varieties of sandwiches and burgers are unlike anywhere else, and their mixed bourbon drinks are all fantastic. The Duck Fat Confit fries or the fried feta cheese will change your life. My only complaint - it's VERY hard to get in here in the evening, and the staff isn't very good about estimating the wait time. Your best bet is to go for lunch, or get there super early for dinner."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jill W.,"Houston, TX",5/23/2018,5.0,"Thank you Yelp for helping us find this! Everything was delicious! My 8 yr old son and I came for lunch. We got fried pickles, bacon burger and salmon burger. Everything was homemade - from the pickles to the bread. Such a nice surprise. Def recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David A.,"Harrisburg, PA",10/31/2015,4.0,Solid place with a lively UT atmosphere. I am pretty picky about my burgers and this place passed the test. Lots of choices and I selected the bison with some verry good toppings. Ordered rare and served more towards medium rare but it was good. Fried cooked in duck fat were excellent. Fun spot. Friendly staff. Thumbs up.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Renee N.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/2/2017,3.0,"I love this place. I live in Marble Alley Lofts and eat here often. I also bring family & friends here when they visit. It's usually pretty good, however, tonight the service and food left much to be desired. I brought two friends who were visiting from out of town. First, my friends and I grabbed a couple seats at the bar after others left. The bartender immediately prepared us water but did not wipe down the table from the previous diners until I asked. Second, my medium well burger was prepared very medium. I had to send it back, so my friends ate without me (they were practically done with their food by the time my burger came back out). While the folks who sat next to me were offered a discount because there food took long to prepare, I was not offered anything and paid regular price for the inconvenience..."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jennie B.,"Chicago, IL",2/12/2015,4.0,"4.5 stars is what this place deserves. Everything here is virtually perfect, save for the gluten free burger bun which completely falls apart after the first bite. I've been here 2 times but once was enough to know that this is one of Knoxville's gems.The burgers are creative, innovative and simply mouth watering. (Just make sure you get the standard bun)The craft cocktails are unique and delightful to the taste buds.Nice ambiance with friendly and effective service.  When you want a great burger you go to Five Guys.  When you want a great burger and a beautiful, relaxing environment with yummy cocktails...you go to Stock & Barrel.(Please don't hate me for putting these two burger joints in the same review. They're both excellent at their own level. Know what I mean?) Tip: Go on off hours because they're small and always packed. Typically there is a wait. Either that or grab a seat at the bar!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Taylor F.,"Lubbock, TX",6/14/2015,5.0,"Soooooo good!!! Great atmosphere and service, and the burgers were perfect! We got the farmhouse burger, and it was heavenly! the Mac and cheese and fries were amazing! Definitely need to try the Duck Confit fries next time."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Guillermo S.,"Morristown, TN",2/28/2016,5.0,"Awesome Burgers (maybe one of the best that i have ever had) The Duck frites were a bomb ( but if you want to live after your 40's you should only eat them once a year). Nice ambient, and friendly service (the only bad thing is that you might have to wait)In my opinion is the best option in Market street."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sandy A.,"Cary, NC",1/9/2018,5.0,THE BEST EVER! I got the bison burger and can't say how much I recommend it.  That's the first burger I tried and I don't want to try anything else because it's just too good! :) Fries and onion rings are also amazing.  Definitely a must try if you're in the area.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John G.,"Knoxville, TN",1/3/2015,4.0,"Word on the street is this is one of the best burgers in town. Stopped in early Saturday, wait of 30-35 minutes, can do  while sipping on a Scottish Ale. A customer at the bar offered me a sip of her beer to test it out, thanks! Bar has about 8 decent drafts.  Saw Ashely Judd dining at an outside table hoping not to be recognized. I have to say, being a big burger fan and all, damn good burger! Cooked to perfection, with great toppings and bun and the best fries!  I had the Billy Burger minus the onions.  Staff and patrons all very friendly! Enjoyable first visit, this place is earning the praise."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shane B.,"Squaw Valley, CA",10/23/2019,5.0,One of the best burgers I have ever had! Highly suggest. The service was fantastic and they were all so helpful and kind. I highly suggest this to anyone who wants an amazing dining experience.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dustin P.,"Austin, TX",7/19/2015,5.0,"Stock and Barrel has certainly lived up to its reputation as one of the best restaurants in Knoxville. The only caveat: I would recommend ordering a step less cooked than normal when here - I felt my burger was overcooked when I ordered my usual.The creative freedom they take with their menu is part of what makes it so successful. I had the Elvis, a burger topped with peanut butter, fried bananas, and smoked bacon. Honestly, it sounded terrible but I was proven wrong. The burger was incredible. I've also gotten the Opa! appetizer both times that I've been. It's a pan seared block of feta covered in Tennessee honey and served with a warm baguette. It's very unique, and very delicious. There's not much more to explain, this is a great spot for great burgers. I would recommend it to anyone."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Scott C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/15/2018,5.0,"This is as good as it gets! Great service and food. Opa, Duck confit fries and a Burger!!! Love this place. We will be back for sure."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Scott F.,"Knoxville, TN",1/27/2015,4.0,"You know us West Knox folks don't make the trek downtown unless there is company from out of town or there are 100,000 folks to get together with on a fall Saturday. We recently had some Atlanta foodies in town so we loaded up the SUV and headed east.  Glad it has navigation...After reading the reviews on Stock and Barrel we thought it was a foodie worthy place for lunch.  2:00 on a Saturday must have been a gathering time because several others had decided on the same plan.  The hostess didn't seem to happy to see us but did put us in for a table and promised to text when they had a spot.  The great thing about market square is there are fun places and people watching to pass away an hour waiting on a table.My first impression was the smell, cocktails and beef! The waitress Was helpful and the menu was impressive.  Being originally from KY I had a great time playing the ""had that one"" game with the bourbon list.  From pedestrian to an out of body experience good they were on the list and choosing took a minute.  We ordered libations; Manhattan, excellent and well crafted. Cider bourbon, unique and tasty. Bloody Mary with bourbon, well they can't all be winners.Burgers for the table were an eclectic mix that I won't bore you with individually, just know they were all a hit.  The gluten free bun was very good with biscuit like texture and taste. The highlight of the meal was the hand cut French fries they were the best of Knoxville.All in all I would say that this resturant is trip worthy!  I really do love downtown and I love finding places that keep me coming back!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Terri W.,"Bellville, TX",7/5/2019,1.0,"Called before hand to let them know we were coming with a large party and we did not have to all sit together. Showed up (18 people) at 4pm and asked to sit on patio. Hostess was very nice and trying to figure out how to push tables together. I guess the manager then comes up and says nope, we won't push tables together at all because there would be different waiters. We say we can do separate checks. He says nope, that's our policy take it or leave it. With that kind of attitude guess we will take our money elsewhere (and we love to eat and drink). Absolutely ridiculous."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Steve B.,"Maynardville, TN",2/13/2016,5.0,"Bison Burger awesome for me, my sweetheart had farmhouse. Love the staff & all the great options for brew & liquor!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Vinnie T.,"Fairfax, VA",12/26/2017,5.0,The food and service were beyond terrific. The menu is very unique and the food was very well priced especially with the portions given.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tim B.,"Mount Carmel, TN",8/28/2018,2.0,"How is this place the top rated restaurant in Knoxville? The food is average at best, and pricey for a burger joint! I must have went on an off night, because I don't see what all the hype is about!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Darelys M.,"Tampa, FL",12/26/2015,4.0,"Very busy! But really glad we ate here. The burgers and duck fat fries were delicious. The sauce that comes with the fries was so good! My favorite burger was the Billy burger, Super Flavorful and good size. The fried green tomatoes were ok but the goat cheese it came with definitely made them taste much better. The smores and Nutella shakes are delicious and a definite must try!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Deirdre A.,"Durham, NC",9/2/2019,5.0,Great food and great bartenders! We had the 'Shroomin Burger and The Mother Clucker (fried chicken sandwich). Even the burger buns were delicious! Everyone from the host (who helped us find two seats at the bar) to the waitstaff were all friendly and welcoming.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Felicity B.,"Washington, DC",2/6/2018,5.0,"Stock & Barrel is phenomenal. Best burger I'ver ever had, hands down. I thought the location was great, environment was calm and casual, but the food and service was top notch. HIGHLY recommend, especially if you're in the mood for a great burger. Will definitely visit again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Marsheena M.,"Downtown, Louisville, KY",8/22/2018,5.0,Great FRESH Burgers and awesome fries! It can get crowded quickly so come early or be prepared to wait for a seat.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David H.,"TN, TN",2/4/2018,4.0,"Happening little place in downtown Knoxville, burgers were delicious.  Service was friendly but not extraordinary."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matt P.,"Thetford, VT",9/3/2017,4.0,"I had heard a lot about Stock & Barrel but never tried it. Just based on their menu, I knew it was going to be good. On a Friday night I knew they would be busy so I used an app to reserve at time and table for two. In the end this didn't matter, as we got to the restaurant and still had to wait around 45 minutes. The restaurant itself is tiny, so people waiting for tables have to stand outside. This is nice because you can take in the sights and sounds of Market Square, but if it starts to rain (as it did while we were waiting), it sends everyone running for cover. When we finally got inside, I ordered The Bernie burger with beer battered onion rings substituted for the french fries. The onion rings were homemade, thick cut, and had a nice coating of batter, but the burger, The Bernie, was the star of this show. Stacked with bacon, fried jalapenos, blueberry preserves, and overflowing with blue cheese crumbles. It was the perfect combination of sweet from the blueberry, salty from the blue cheese, and crunchy from the fried jalapenos and bacon. It was honestly the best burger I've ever eaten. The thought of it alone makes my mouth water. The only thing that kept me from giving Stock & Barrel a 5-star rating is that it took so long to get a table, but I will definitely be going here again the next time I'm in Knoxville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Maurice J.,"Orlando, FL",4/15/2018,5.0,Whitney was our server and she was amazing !!! The food was out of this world !!!! When we come back to Knoxville we will most definitely be back !
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John A.,"Redding, CA",6/28/2019,4.0,Large selection of whiskey. Decent amount of draft beer.  The burgers are the main attraction. Several one of a kind burgers cooked to perfection.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Barry F.,"Dandridge, TN",8/16/2018,4.0,"Visited Stock & Barrel on Market Square this past Sunday with my wife and kids. We receive a friendly greeting from the hostesses, upon entering, and were promptly seated. I ordered the Steakhouse burger, along with a Buffalo Trace Whiskey Flight. The burger and the flight were delicious. Our kids each had the Nutella shake. I only wish the menu included a good cut of steak to have, as well, with the fine whiskies available from the bar. Overall though, it was a great visit with great company and a friendly staff."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,RC S.,"Heath, TX",4/13/2018,5.0,"Excellent old fashions, duck fries, burgers, and service. One of the best in the Southeast."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Luther E.,"Knoxville, TN",4/7/2015,5.0,"Everlong has been my quest for a great burger in Knox Vegas.  It finally arrived about two years ago.  I once begrudgingly had to say that Copper Cellar or Fuddruckers was the best, but no more. Located in Market Square, this place is kind of small for the crowd it drawls, but is worth rubbing elbows and, sometimes, the wait.  The burgers are natural and often the ingredients are local and/or organic. You can truly taste the difference. The burgers are a bit high compared to somewhere like Copper Cellar or Litton's, but they are huge.As other posters have said, try the duck fries. Not made of duck, but cooked in duck fat-ask for extra sauce with the fries. My only gripe, and it's a small one, is that often the wait is extremely long.  It's best to call ahead of time or hit the place up early on a Monday/Tuesday. The drinks, mostly bourbon mixes, are great, but if you are not a whiskey, scotch, bourbon fan, the selection is a tad light. Drinks are in the same range, slightly expensive, but like the burgers, a good mix of unique flavors. Please look at my pic next to my name. I truly have to limit myself to once every two to three weeks here or it would look like the FatBooth app on iphone. - Remember: Call ahead and don't eat all day before going."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley D.,"Loxahatchee, FL",9/15/2017,5.0,"Tried this place while visiting downtown Knoxville. We evacuated from Florida due to Hurricane Irma and were really searching for some good comfort food to take our minds off things for awhile. This place was great! Great atmosphere and perfect weather to sit outside. Our waitress was very personable which also made it even more enjoyable. We both had burgers which were quite tasty and decided to try the foie gras fries. They were tasty but not out of this world..the regular fries were actually better..sprinkled with sea salt and rosemary. All in all, we would definitely go back!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Adam F.,"Davison, MI",6/23/2019,5.0,"Nice bar to have a beer at. Great location in the market square, seating outside as well as inside and at the bar. Burger was great, beef comes from a local farm. Staff was quick and friendly."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ty M.,"KIMBERLIN HGT, TN",8/22/2019,5.0,"Some of the best burgers in town, and the duck confit fries are not to be missed.  Prices are a little high for the casual lunch stop-in, but on par with other Market Square offerings.  Great selection of whiskey and some pretty interesting cocktails.  If you haven't been or only have a limited time in town, be sure to check it out."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jonathan F.,"Shelby, NC",3/28/2016,5.0,"Burgers and bourbon... and both are simply the best! A small venue in size, but HUGE in character and quality. Their whiskey list is incredible- whiskeys, bourbons, scotches- and their signature burgers are second to none. My family has eaten a lot of burgers in our lives, and these were absolutely the best!The ""Bernie,"" a burger that boasts blue cheese, jalapenos, and blueberry preserves, might sound a little crazy, but good lord is it good! I also recommend the Tennessee vs. Kentucky whiskey flight. When in doubt, ask the knowledgeable wait staff, who can steer you in the right direction.Any visit to Knoxville should include a stop at this wonderful establishment, and a  big bucket of fries prepared in duck fat... that's right, duck fat. You've never had it before, but it will be the fry by which all others are evaluated from here on out."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paige J.,"Old City, Knoxville, TN",7/22/2018,5.0,"An incredible experience. A must if you are visiting downtown Knoxville. Be prepared for a wait if you are attending on a weekend, but completely worth it! A wonderful atmosphere, incredible food, and a fun menu. What more could you ask for?"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,James B.,"Atlanta, GA",11/18/2017,4.0,"How good is it?  On Saturday evening there was a 2.5 hour wait list to eat a hamburger!  With that said, use the Yelp wait list app, it worked great.  The restaurant was extremely over crowded but the wait staff managed it well. When we were seated, our waiter was prompt and courteous.  Our food and drinks were served quick and accurate.  The burgers were made from local beef, bread, and bacon which added a nice touch.  The bourbon selection was the largest I have ever seen in a restaurant.  It's  not healthy but it is delicious; you will not be disappointed."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Minda C.,"St. Petersburg, FL",9/24/2017,5.0,Great hamburger--was fresh and flavorful. I had the salmon burger with avocado which also delicious. Onion rings were thick light and crisp. The tomato salad was amazing with quality balsamic vinaigrette. Service was quick.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shayla S.,"Knoxville, TN",8/10/2019,5.0,This place by far has the best burgers in Knoxville! They use a local farm to source their beef and it shows. Great drinks and food! A local gem.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robyn G.,"Statesboro, GA",12/16/2015,5.0,"My friends and I came here for lunch during a training. I had the Shroomin and duck confit fries. This was INCREDIBLE. I'd give more information, but I'm still in a food coma."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany H.,"Lexington, KY",8/6/2019,5.0,"If you're looking for an amazing burger, this is definitely the place! They have so many different burgers! It was so hard for me to choose!! I asked my waiter and she suggested either the Shroomin or the Mother Clucker. Both of which were my top two I was deciding between! I went with the Shroomin and by golly it was the best burger I've ever had! I couldn't decide between onion rings or fries, you can do half and half(for free)! Can't wait to come back and try another burger and maybe some bourbon too!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Randy E.,"Nashville, TN",9/27/2017,5.0,"Awesome burger!! The meat is first quality, the bun is balanced--not too much or too little--and the service has been impeccable each visit. Highly recommend. One of my fav burgers ever!! And oh, the duck confit fries aren't so bad either! Also, great selection of whiskeys and beers."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mandy D.,"Birmingham, AL",6/3/2019,5.0,Absolutely a must! Delicious food and drinks! Highly recommend the white pimento cheese dip and the burgers are the best we have ever had!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nick P.,"Port Orange, FL",6/27/2018,5.0,"My daughter and I ate there for my birthday.  We are what you might say ""connoisseurs of burgers"" and these are awesome. The duck fries as well (made of potatoes but fried in duck fat).  The wait was a little long but it was a busy night and there are lots of little shops to walk around and look at while waiting for your reservation to be sent to your Yelp app."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,H M.,"Snohomish, WA",2/20/2018,5.0,"Worth it! These guys know burgers and do it well. Cooked to perfection. Great options, fast and friendly service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Erica K.,"Riverview, Columbus, OH",6/24/2018,5.0,"Most incredible burger I've ever had in my life. I ordered the bison burger and the flavors are combined so elegantly, you cannot visit Knoxville without coming to this place! I also ordered the Twins Basil cocktail. Great use of fresh strawberries and basil! The atmosphere was phenomenal. Love this place! One of my all time favorites!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michelle I.,"Clinton, TN",5/23/2017,5.0,My husband and I ate here with our son after a college visit. We had been wanting to try it and were finally in the area and decided to eat here. I had the Hurt Locker which was amazing with pimento cheese and Benton's bacon. My husband tried the Steakhouse which he liked. And our son managed to eat most of the Big Nasty which is huge!! Their regular fries are really good too but I just had to try the duck confit fries. Yum!! You have to order those! We can't wait to go back soon.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,L O.,"Fort Sanders, Knoxville, TN",9/11/2018,4.0,"Love this place! Great for burgers and beer. Wonderful atmosphere, amazing customer service! The hostess named Rachel was very helpful with seating arrangements and the waiter was very informed on the menu. Overall, awesome experience!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley P.,"Spartanburg, SC",2/10/2018,5.0,"Pimento cheese served hot in a skillet, flash fried feta with texas honey for starters; yes!! So tasty. We had The Billy burger and it was on point. Be sure to join the waitlist from the yelp app. Otherwise you might be waiting for a looong time. Great vibe and friendly staff."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jack D.,"Friendsville, TN",2/9/2018,4.0,"Ok, went back, and the server was Rachel. And she was great, again. I'd off though that this is a VERY noisy place. Great vibe for a bourbon bar, less so for dinner, so I may limit my visits to drinks. They make the best Old Fashioned ever, so if that's your thing..."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jack D.,"Friendsville, TN",1/5/2018,5.0,"Sat at the bar, since there was a huge wait, but worked out well because the bartender (I HATE that I forgot her name) was awesome. They've got probably the largest selection of bourbons...anywhere. Not a big bourbon guy, so it was a little overwhelming, but when I asked her for a ""reasonably priced selection"", she brought me Angel's Envy, which was so good I ran out and bought a bottle the next day. We only had burgers, so I can't comment much on the food, but they were very good. But I had the best Old-Fashion EVER, so 5 stars just for that alone. Can't wait to go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/28/2019,5.0,"Love this place!!!! Best burgers in town!! Highly recommended 11/10. The food doesn't take long to come out, servers are very welcoming and kind, and the food is amazing you just can't beat it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tommy W.,"Knoxville, TN",6/13/2018,5.0,WOW!!!!!! This place is small but packs a serious punch!!! We get the Hurtlocker and share it! Why? Simply it hurts if you eat the whole thing by yourself. What a great place in market square! NO SYSCO processed food here! If you are downtown Knoxville please make sure you visit this place for a great meal and awesome art work on the walls.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matthew V.,"Bellbrook, OH",12/1/2014,5.0,on this choice I turned to Yelp for help.standing in the park like setting of market square I saw at least six places to eat.chose Stock n Barrel based on reviews.what a great choice.lots and lots of places claim to have a GREAT burger.this place has one of the better burgers I have ever had.I swear I saw the BK King hiding in the corner drinking whiskey and eating a free range burger.the bun is a local crafted masterpiece. step inside and chose from 150 bourbons.have a burger.tell them the King sent you.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Turner M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/12/2018,4.0,Some of the best burgers in town; you can't go wrong with any of them. Good assortment of drinks offered and nothing is too pricy. The aura of the place is just what you would expect from the name; a Tennessee whiskey styled bar with a dash of class.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,El Tomas H.,"Bellemont, AZ",2/6/2018,5.0,"If you are looking for a great, no an amazing burger, this is the place. From your traditional burgers to a more adventurous burger it's all very satisfying. I had the gyro burger which was a burger and gyro meat served on naan with a tzatziki sauce, this was killer. The service, the atmosphere, the food all provided for a unique experience in the heart of downtown Knoxville in market square. They only thing I wasn't a fan of were the duck fries. I'd skip it and just get regular fries."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lisa C.,"Austin, TX",5/25/2019,4.0,"We were driving from Nashville to Asheville and stopped in Knoxville for lunch (so many -ville's!). Everybody in the car wanted a burger, so we found Stock and Barrel. Free parking and a beautiful market square on a gorgeous day made it especially nice. We ate outside on the small patio, where we had great service and everybody got their choice of burger. They came out juicy and pink on the inside. Mine was the ""Billy"" with goat cheese and ""bourbon onions."" It was lovely. DH had the ""Hurt Locker"" and was blown away by the pimiento cheese and fried green tomato. Fries and onion rings were great! We were there on a Saturday afternoon and it was busy, but not too busy, which we liked. Heading to the restroom I walked through the bar area and inhaled the wonderful smell of bourbon that seemed to permeate the floors and walls. Really nice spot for burgers! I wish we had had a chance to try some bourbon, but we had miles to go. A very lovely memory!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lauren B.,"Houston, TX",10/27/2014,5.0,"Guys, I ordered the steakhouse again... what can I say, I am a woman of her word. BUT my husband ordered the buffalo and my life was changed.  The buffalo is a beef burger with blue cheese fondue, buffalo sauce, and celery.  I am usually not a fan of blue cheese and I have worried this burger would be overpowered by it, but I was wrong.  The blue cheese fondue is delicious mixed with the buffalo sauce... creating its own special creamy sauce.  The celery added a nice crunch and I CANNOT wait to order this burger again.  My stomach is currently growling."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lauren B.,"Houston, TX",10/18/2014,5.0,"I've never not gotten the steakhouse burger... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I have tried bites of the bacon burger, surf and turf, hurt locker, and the 'merican. All were amazing and worth ordering again. The macaroni and cheese is pretty much the best thing that has ever happened to my life. I love the fried pickles and french fries too!  The vibe here is just so awesome whether you come here for a drink or dinner. They recently expanded their beer list for those who don't do craft beer and they have tons of liquor! We come here as often as possible!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelsey P.,"Savannah, GA",6/22/2015,3.0,"Not quite sure what the hype is about... food wasn't mind-blowingly delicious, or even remarkable. I had the chicken and waffle sandwich, which was pretty good and my boyfriend had the spicy (whatever) burger, which i wouldn't order again. What saved this place was its whiskey selection, tons of options, BUT the prices could be better. All in all it was a nice lunch but not a place Id recommended or want to go back to."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachelle S.,"Greenville, SC",7/7/2017,4.0,"After three years of attempting to go but the wait time was too long, I got to try these tasty burgers. I had the burger special and it was prepared perfectly. The regular fries were very fresh and nicely done. I wasn't a fan of the duck fries (although the sauce served with them is very yummy) and thought they were too heavy and I'm not sure why anyone would want them when their regular fries are so tasty. We ate at the bar and service was good and friendly."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cindy D.,"Knoxville, TN",8/1/2015,4.0,"My first time dining here.  The burger was cooked to perfection.  The waitress was very professional.  The fries very crisp,   would have liked a bigger portion of fries.   The only downside, we waited over 2 hours for a table on a friday night ."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Anton T.,"Atlanta, GA",5/31/2018,5.0,I ordered the Bernie and fries. Their service was great the food was great and the location and scenery were all perfect. A great little place to sit on the patio catch up on some work emails and have a bourbon drink if it is after 5 PM. I cannot wait to go back to try another item on the menu. Once again yelp has not failed me and made a great recommendation. Check out my video blog and review.  youtu.be/4xc9nml_Wng
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Caro J.,"Atlanta, GA",7/19/2019,5.0,"Stopped in while traveling through Knoxville. Very impressed by the quality of their burgers. The fried pickles, onion rings, french fries were all delicious!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ben F.,"Knoxville, TN",9/29/2014,5.0,"Solid!  Every. single. time.  All the burgers are grass fed beef.  I usually start it off with The iceberg wedge.  Usually iceberg salads don't do it for me, but Stock's wedge is killer. Tip:  Get yo'self a draft Lagunita's IPA to wash down that Hurt Locker burger. I've also had their (free range) chicken sandwich. It's delicious. The have a few vegetarian options. The black bean burger comes highly recommended by my vegetatian friends.  There is usually a few minute wait as the place probably seats less than 50 people. So stop by and get your name on the list, then check out the rest of Market Square while you wait."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ted C.,"San Diego, CA",5/26/2018,5.0,"Moved to Knoxville a few months ago and finally went on a date here last night. Had the farmhouse w/ onion rings and it was superb. More importantly, the server(I think his name was Ben) gave us excellent service throughout our time there, and the horseradish sauce he recommended was really good. I highly recommend this place and plan to go again in the near future."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany T.,"Aurora, CO",5/15/2018,5.0,This place was amazing. Cozy seating and great beer!! The food is top notch and as fresh as you can get. Try the duck confit fries!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kevin L.,"Ozark, MO",5/11/2019,5.0,I was in town for work and came here for dinner. The service was great and the food was good as well. I had a burger.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian P.,"Hollywood, FL",5/7/2015,4.0,"Salmon burger and French fries were really good, but you can get good versions of those at lots of places. I'm really only leaving this review so I can bring the proper attention to the amazing Nutella milkshake with S'mores topping. It's like sex, only with toasted marshmallows on top. Please don't leave Stock & Barrel without having toasted marshmallow sex."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jim W.,"Surprise, AZ",8/11/2015,4.0,"What can I say, I went here for lunch in search of a burger and a beer. I got exactly that, and the goodness didn't end there, friends. First, the food was above average quality as was the beer choices. After a few pints of things I've never heard of, I moved onto the whiskey menu. This is where the place really shines.  The flights are well thought out and they are well priced. Service is average for a bar type place, and the location is great right in market square. Not too shabby, worth a stop if you're in town."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tammy J.,"Alcoa, TN",7/7/2017,5.0,"I get the regular burger, so there are no special or fancy ingredients to make it awesome - - it's just awesome. Love the garlic aoili on the fries, too. Splurge once in awhile and get the duck-fat fries. They're sooooo good. Totally worth our drive from Maryville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joanna C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/3/2018,4.0,I will say the owner reached out to me after posting my review stating that he will essentially train his staff better so that was definitely a plus. Still the best burger in town!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joanna C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/29/2017,2.0,"The food is always amazing but the service is less than stellar. We went there recently and they were out of every wine I asked for. Blamed it on being a ""busy weekend"". Fair enough. My only other option was a $15. glass of wine so I asked for it and also asked if they would honor the price of the wine that I originally wanted to which they said, ""no"". Not only that, I asked for a sample taste of wine and it was barely a sip. Poor management - bad training."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Wendy W.,"Kansas City, MO",10/14/2017,5.0,"I ate here while I was traveling on business and it didn't disappoint.  The waiter was attentive and suggested items that the restaurant was known for which I greatly appreciated.  I got the Kentucky Bourboun beer and The Hurt Locker, simply amazing!  I will definitely eat here again when I'm back in town.  Thank you!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cody M.,"Charlotte, NC",10/12/2017,5.0,"Good burgers. Not super greasy, cooked to order, nice bun, and a variety of options. Beer was great (Yeehaw Pilsner). Door could use a cushion, but I sat directly next to it so...."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dominick A.,"Knoxville, TN",4/27/2018,3.0,"Always great burgers and beer. Only drawback is sitting on top of your neighbors. That's the only reason I put 3 stars is I like privacy, if you don't mind then 4.5 stars for sure. Never had a burger I didn't love."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Krista R.,"Kingston, TN",7/3/2019,5.0,Tried this place on a whim....wow!  Great burgers!  You can taste the quality in the beef.  I had the Elvis burger~delicious . My son had the Chicken and Waffle sandwich.  A most try of you like burgers!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Taylor B.,"Antioch, TN",7/5/2015,5.0,Delicious burgers.  I got the 'merican burger.  I ordered it medium rare and with extra salt and that is how they made it.  The dipping sauce they served with the fries was tasty.  Reminded me of thousand island or comeback sauce.  Pimento cheese app was also very good.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brandi H.,"Knoxville, TN",3/23/2015,4.0,"This place has the best burgers in Market Square. The duck confit(sp) fries are really good but not good enough to buy a la carte. Just get the Bison burger, the fries come with it. I hate the chairs there, though. They are hard and uncomfrotable but the food and service make up for that."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Canan A.,"Medford, NJ",8/16/2015,5.0,The waiter at our hotel told us this place had the best burgers in Knoxville!!  He was right!!!  And the duck fat fries that everyone's talking about?  Amazing!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lawton R.,"Nashville, TN",9/29/2017,5.0,Burger was cooked perfectly and high quality meat and toppings. Fries were phenomenal as well. All around great place
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Severin K.,"Fresno, CA",8/8/2017,5.0,"This just took my number one spot for best burgers. Got an old fashioned and a Manhattan to drink, lots of whiskey choices! My burger was the classic bacon cheeseburger with onion rings. Complimentary flair pairings on this gourmet burger make it more than amazing! Atmosphere was great with the right ambiance in lighting and services. The bartender, who I believe may also be the owner was outstanding and had the perfect amount of poise and professionalism. Strongly recommend if in Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Wendy H.,"Mechanicsville, VA",6/24/2019,5.0,"The food here is excellent! The only suggestion I can make is to open another location in Richmond, Virginia!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Becky K.,"Knoxville, TN",9/18/2017,4.0,"Stock and Barrel is the best burger I've had in Knoxville. Their ingredients are always fresh and their ideas for combos are excellent. Plus, they make a wonderful french fry --and milk shake. That latter is high praise for me since I don't like them generally without malt. Only two complaints:  The place is quite small and it can be a WAIT to get in if you don't hit them in off hours. They are also a bit dark in places so if you prefer sunshine, you will want to eat outside."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Helen C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/9/2014,5.0,"Oh my gosh, they serve such good food here! We took our adult children, spouses and grandchildren and everyone loved it. Of course we all wanted to sit together, and while it was a stretch to do so they found a way to accommodate our large group by creatively moving several tables. The menu offers something for every taste. They take everyday dishes (burgers, salads, sides) and turn them into a gourmet experience without a bit of pretense. I was lucky to taste several different sandwiches and they were all yummy. I must say my favorite was what I ordered, the classic bacon burger. Their other speciality is bourbon, and they sure have a great list of offerings. They offer interesting bourbon flights, with Tennessee vs Kentucky being my favorite. They also have a commendable beer, wine and mixed drink list."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Hayden V.,"Hernando, MS",7/23/2017,5.0,"Excellent food and quality. Local grass fed beef, they care about where their food comes from. Convenient on market square. Basically everything is good on market square!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ataya V.,"Knoxville, TN",3/25/2018,4.0,Only down fall is the wait... over all great friend atmosphere. Good food and drinks. Waitress very friendly and helpful. Great pickles!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brient K.,"Knoxville, TN",9/23/2016,5.0,"Stock and barrel has become the most popular Knoxville restaurant, and there Is a reason for their success. The hamburgers are creative and flavorful , and the fries are much better than average, especially if you get the duck confit fries. Warning: duck fries are greasy but delicious"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelly B.,"South Knoxville, Knoxville, TN",3/21/2018,5.0,Best burger in Knoxville. And those duck fries. We're awesome.. great food great survive..
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeffrey B.,"Las Vegas, NV",4/27/2017,3.0,"Let me break down my review even further than the 3 stars...4 stars for atmosphere and beer2 stars for food taste/flavorAfter reading all the great reviews plus the word of mouth I got from people at work, I was ready to dive in and love this place. Took my wife here for her birthday and the hostess was nice and seated us right away. Ordered drinks and looked over the menu. First thoughts of the menu was not one burger jumped out and said... YOU MUST EAT THIS! Now I understand that has to do with taste and preference but that's all I can. I ended up choosing the Ring of Fire burger which was spicy hot (in a good way). My wife couldn't decided so she ordered the burger salad and we shared a side of Mac and cheese. Food came out rather fast, and I was excited to try the burger place everyone at work talks about. Burger was pretty spicy and cooked how I asked... onion rings were ok but the mac and cheese lacked any flavor. All I could taste was the pasta and not the cheese sauce. That was disappointing bcuz Mac and cheese is my fav! Wife told me her birder salad wasn't that great and that she was still hungry afterwards (which rarely happens). All in all... it was okay. Maybe my expectations were set to high."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,SK H.,"Nashville, TN",12/13/2018,5.0,"I travel 13 states regularly and have the opportunity to try a multitude of restaurants and thus is one of my (if not the) most favorite restaurants period (The Bernie).  I've eaten here no less than 10x, service and food has always been consistent - impeccable.  However, last night 12/12/18) we sat at the bar to eat, one of the bartenders was soo poor in terms of service and experience I literally said to the person I was eating with, this may be my last visit here.  Now, here come my next however, the other bartender Jenna SAVED the experience.  She was friendly, knowledgeable, just a true asset to Stock & Barrel.  The engaging environment she created at ""her"" bar with ""her"" customers was world class.  It so nice to see when customer service employees who authentically enjoy interacting with customers, versus the example of the other bartender where customers were simply a nuisance to her."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,SK H.,"Nashville, TN",1/14/2015,5.0,"Wednesday 1/14/2015 @ 1:00pm. Best burger I've had in a long while (The Bernie).  Sat at the bar, the young lady behind bar was great, very attentive and provided good recommendations.  Bourbon selection is world class. I will be back for sure."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tiffany S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/17/2018,4.0,Good burgers. Thought the'd have sliders but did not. Liked being able to sit with friends on patio on a Saturday night. Pickles are Bread & Butter...not dill.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,William R.,"Fort Bragg, NC",3/17/2018,5.0,The place its awesome! We are just visiting knoxville for the first time and all the locals recommended this place as the best burger and beer joint in town! We were not disappointed
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian A.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/13/2019,3.0,"Not as good as expected, don't listen to hype. It's still good but not amazing. Also not a whiskey drinker so maybe that's why people like it. There are better burgers in town that might even be cheaper."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kaylin Y.,"Santa Clarita, CA",11/6/2017,5.0,"I try to be very selective with my 5 star reviews, but this place deserves it. I've been twice, and both experiences were absolutely stellar. The meat is so fresh and juicy. I prefer my burgers medium to medium rare and they do it perfectly. The duck confit fries are to die for- although it should be noted: they don't put actual duck confit on them. I'm assuming they just fry them in duck fat. Still worth the upcharge! The burgers are unique without being too strange. The buns tasted fresh and homemade. I had a cocktail that was delicious. Overall, really impressed. Quite possibly the best burger I've had to date."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kayla R.,"Knoxville, TN",11/6/2017,5.0,"Just all around, YAS! A few must try items are the Pimento Cheese dip appetizer with the most amazing tomato jam on top, duck confit fries, The Bison burger and S'mores milkshake. I suggest going at an ""off"" time because it tends to be a long wait, but this place is so worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dakota J.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",3/10/2018,5.0,I go here for the black bean burger exclusively. I would recommend it to anybody that likes avocado and black beans. It's a superb burger for vegetarians!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike W.,"Matthews, NC",6/9/2019,5.0,"Visiting Knoxville on business trip. Stopped in here after seeing some reviews and because it was a five minute walk from my hotel. Ice cold beer, great atmosphere and one of the best burgers I've had this year. A must try if you are in Knoxville. Looks like the y have a location in Nashville too."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Julia Y.,"Lancer's Estates, Plano, TX",3/7/2018,5.0,"By far the best burger in Knoxville! The menu has such a great variety of burgers with fresh, authentic flavors. I always leave extremely satisfied. My favorites are the Elvis, the Bernie, and Shroomin'. Love love love this place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kc B.,"Barstow, CA",7/5/2015,5.0,"Awesome food!My husband and I were passing through on a road trip and decided to stop. He got the burger with peanut butter and fried banana, added their blueberry jam- I tried it- amazing!I had the mother clucker and switched out the ha arts for goat cheese, delicious and awesome fries.They do have gluten free buns, but they were out at this time.Definitely a must go. It is a small place, just a heads up."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Daniel W.,"Mount Olive, NC",10/31/2015,5.0,This is one of the best local restaurants/bars I've been to in quite a while. The buffalo burger and fries were cooked to perfection.  Bourbon lovers will absolutely love it. They have a while inventory of different bourbons and whiskey to try. Flights are also available to sample several.  I tried the Stock and Barrel flight. It has some of the best you'll ever try. This is an absolute must if you're visiting the Knoxville area.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jai L.,"Mableton, GA",4/9/2017,4.0,"Good atmosphere. Good food. Good options for vegetarians, there black bean burger is delicious.  The only drawback was a pact if they didn't have dessert available. They were able to accommodate our group with 9 without any issue"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joseph D.,"Clarkston, MI",8/14/2017,4.0,Great burgers and frites. Tomato salad was perfect to split while my buddy ordered the duck fries great combo of fresh and interesting ingredients. We traded jokes and laughs with our incredible waitress(go Gamecocks). We will return for more beer and bourbon!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Crystal S.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/2/2019,5.0,"We waited an hour for a group of 8 while visiting Knoxville. And glad we did! The drinks were delicious, the burgers, salads and duck fries were fantastic as well! Great service too!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Walt T.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",5/31/2019,4.0,"Burgers are pretty good.   Not the best I've had, but not bad.  Fries were pretty good too.  Good beer and bourbon selection."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sergey G.,"Indianapolis, IN",11/26/2014,3.0,"Although my cocktail was not prepared properly, the management handled the situation in a very professional manner that increased my opinion about the place. Very nice atmosphere and location on the market sq."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Leslie M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",10/16/2017,5.0,Stumbled on this place by accident. Love the atmosphere. Food was amazing! Servers are extremely friendly.  A must if you love burgers!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Olivia M.,"Odenton, MD",10/16/2017,5.0,So yummy. People come near and far for their food and are willing to wait up to 4 hours to eat it. This place is to die for!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,K.F. P.,"Franklin, MA",1/2/2015,4.0,"Very good burgers and more bourbon than you can possible try in six months, but the servers seem to know each brand so they will guide to to their faves. The burgers are very tasty' but the star was the duck confit fries. So, so good. Tastes like Thanksgiving in a French fry. They were very busy, so you can put in your name and they will text you when a table is ready."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brooklyn B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/2/2015,4.0,"Everyone in my group was pleased with their meals. I got the chicken and waffle sandwich and thought it was good, but could have used some butter or maple syrup. The waffle was a little bland. I had a side of the village salad which was honestly better than my sandwich. All of the ingredients were super fresh and full of flavor. Overall, it is a good place to try out and worth the long wait. The menu is very extensive and full of creative options if you are looking to try something new."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,S B.,"Knoxville, TN",2/15/2018,5.0,"For my first visit, our party ordered the fried pickles and fried mushroom appetizers. Both were fresh, delicious, and the portions were large. The appetizers could easily serve 3-4 people, and were a great value for the price. I tried the farmhouse burger with duck confit fries and was not disappointed. The locally raised beef had a wonderful flavor and was cooked perfectly to spec. Their scotch/whiskey/liquor selection is also wonderful! I definitely recommend Stock & Barrel for a quick lunch or a nice casual dinner. The service was fantastic as well."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Anthony A.,"Newark, NJ",7/24/2014,4.0,"Great burger. I had the Billy, goat cheese onions tomato jam. I was skeptical at first, a lot of these Fancy burger joints just give you a burger that's barley better then a Big Mac. 1st I asked for medium rare, yes they could and yes they did. Great.2nd a real bun not that crap that you get in fast food places.3rd the burger had texture not just super fine ground.The place has outside seating and a bar. Best burger I've had in a V long time. I'll be back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelly S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/13/2018,5.0,"A small place, so yiu may have to wait, but such great food! You should definitely try it :) well will be going back for sure. Hopefully soon"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John W.,"Sarasota, FL",2/7/2015,5.0,"So, the morning started out with me in church (Our Lady of Immaculate Conception) for a wedding.  Now I'm not saying that I don't go to Church very often, but I couldn't help but notice that my wife let me walk in the entry first, eyed the architectural soundness of the building, THEN followed me inside.  What can I say, I'm a cynical non-believer and she suspected that the whole place might come tumbling down just as soon as I walked in.After the ceremony we were hungry so we walked down to Stock and Barrel for lunch.  Holy shit, is this place freaking delicious!  There were no tables available when we got there, so the hostess took our cell number and texted us when one was available.  Since they text your cell phone instead of using those ridiculous, bulky pagers, you're free to walk around the stores (sorry, ""boutiques"") in the immediate area.  Actually, you're not missing much if you skip this altogether as each store has pretty-much the same crap inside.So once we got our table, we ordered fried mushrooms, a couple of hamburgers, and the fried apple pie for lunch.  After just a couple of minutes, our mushrooms came and, WOW, they were really good.  But the hamburger was the real star if the show.  I got the black -n- blue burger and after just a few bites proclaimed it to be THE GREATEST HAMBURGER I HAVE EVER EATEN! It was done to perfection and served on a delicious roll as well.  The onion rings that came with it, like the mushrooms were perfectly fried with absolutely no grease whatsoever.  The fried Apple pie with ice cream was also delicious.  It was as if Mary Magdalena had come down from heaven and cooked my food HERSELF as a reward for my having gone to church that morning.Are you in downtown Knoxville wondering what the hell you are doing there in the first place and where you are going to eat?  Well, I can't help you with the first question, but I can sure as hell help you with the second: eat at the Stock and Barrel!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christopher H.,"Greenville, SC",10/8/2017,5.0,I was on a time crunch so didn't really get to enjoy a beverage but I did gobble down the 'Mercian burger with the duck confit fries. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. The fries were incredible and bursting with flavor...a little greasy though. Not the place to go if you're counting calories but a wonderful little dive restaurant. I'll be back for sure!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Leroy B.,"Phoenix, AZ",2/1/2015,5.0,"First, hands down the best burgers we've ever had. Friendly staff, a good bar, and a great vibe.If you plan on coming out to have one though, come early.  It's small and always bumping, plan on doing some shopping while you wait or head down the road to Clancy's for a drink."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,A. Lane S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/28/2014,3.0,"Stopped here for lunch with my husband on a Saturday. Decided to sit outside as there was some sort of festival taking place on Market Square that we wanted to watch from our seats. There was no wait despite being a busy Saturday at lunch time so we were seated right away. The outdoor tables aren't much to look at nor are they particularly comfortable. If we hadn't wanted to watch what was going on we would have opted for indoors. Did get to see a little bit of of the inside and it's fine but I'll admit I expected something a bit more upscale based on how the restaurant markets itself. Our server was very friendly and made recommendations. I actually changed my order based on a suggestion he made. I can't remember the name of the burger but it had blueberries, blue cheese, and jalapenos on it. The burger itself was cooked well and the meat was tasty. The toppings didn't really go well together for my taste buds but others may find it appealing. My husband had the shroomin burger and liked it. Tried the duck confit fries as the side and the fries were gobbled up quickly. Overall we had a good experience and will definitely come back and try some other menu options."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael L.,"Atlanta, GA",11/21/2014,5.0,"Place is good! Elvis burger tasted like a doughnut. Bison burger was fantastic. Ordered medium, cooked as I ordered. Toppings was good. Great place."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amy S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/6/2016,4.0,"I love this place! I have been twice and both times have had good food, good service, and not too bad of a wait. I get the salmon burger which is the consistency of a crab cake, really yummy! That duck fat fries are excellent (my husband got these) and the BLACK BEAN & CORN SALAD is good, but far from a salad... more like a salsa. I probably would't get it again -not that is wasn't good, it just wasn't what I expected- it was kinda like texas caviar."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Whitney C.,"Strawberry Plains, TN",4/22/2018,5.0,"This place has the best burgers and fries, once you eat there nothing will ever compare to it not even come close. Friendly staff,  if there is a wait time you can give them your number and they will text you when a table is ready. It was my second time eating there and bringing my boyfriend and some with me for their first time and they was beyond happy with the amount of food and how great it tasted.  We will be back soon."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jamie F.,"Knoxville, TN",10/19/2014,4.0,"I am not a burger person OR a bourbon person, but this still got 4 stars from me! The atmosphere is great, the food is delicious, you get a large portion, and the staff is knowledgable. This is pretty much heaven for my husband."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tara R.,"Knoxville, TN",5/16/2019,5.0,Literally the best burger place ever! Gourmet burgers at a totally reasonable price and the quality is out of this world. Recommend this place to everyone I meet. The ingredients are all sourced locally if possible and it's just an overall great experience.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Susan N.,"Pompano Beach, FL",9/14/2017,5.0,Great gastropub with creative variety of burgers. We had the Lamburger which was phenomenal and The Ring of Fire which held no heat back. Alison and Danny were helpful in making recommendations for good and beverage. Great staff and worth another visit!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ralph G.,"TN, TN",9/9/2017,5.0,"Great burger place, the meat they use is very flavorful, best I've had. Must try the fried feta and honey. Very generous portions. Highly recommended."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Niloy C.,"Houston, TX",6/24/2017,5.0,"Stock & Barrel was so great. We didn't know what to expect in Knoxville being vegetarians but this place was more than accommodating. All the appetizers and our burgers came out quickly and hot and everything was fantastic! We got the fried green tomatoes, the shrooms, and the pimento cheese. All 3 were so good we chowed them down immediately. Lastly, Dana was an incredible hostess and we wanna give her a shout out for showing us such a good time in Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,The Wilson's 2.,"Norcross, GA",5/8/2017,2.0,"Disappointing? Let down? Yep. I was so excited about trying this place with all the reviews!! We waited almost 10 min for a rude server. Then the hostess seemed annoyed we asked to move outside when we just waited 10 min and didn't even have our drinks. (Several empty tables) I got charged $1 for adding mustard to my burger - which I was not told til we had our bill. The tomato salad was A-mazing. The burger was ok. Not awesome. Not 5 star FOR DANG SURE! Neither was my husbands. There are so many other good options to try, I would put this down on your list."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Drew T.,"Knoxville, TN",5/11/2019,5.0,"One of the best burgers you will have in East Tennessee.  The wait can sometimes be a bit long, but it is worth it!  Atmosphere and service are also top notch"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jerry C.,"Baltimore, MD",4/6/2017,5.0,The reviews are correct. This place is awesome. Great food and the whiskey list is long. The bison burger was moist and delish. The mother clucker fried chicken sandwich was perfectly cooked. The outer coating was crispy but not greasy. The chicken breast was thick and moist.  The onion rings were handmade and crispy.  The sandwich bread is from a local bakery and it was a perfect compliment. There are many menu choices to choose from and this place can accommodate any person.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Colton A.,"Indianapolis, IN",12/31/2017,1.0,Came all the way from Indiana for new years eve and waited 2 1/2 hours to eat there.... Finally called to check in and were told we were taken off of the wait list and that they were closing. Could have eaten at notwatsons with a 15 minute wait but really wanted to give this place our business. Unfortunately we wont be attempting to come back here. It's going to be a hungry new years for us  :(
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie S.,"Durham, NC",8/25/2017,3.0,Unpopular opinion here as I am vegan and took my non-vegan family her because they wanted burgers. The options for myself were just salad. While it was a nice salad I wish there was a veg burger for being a fancy burger place. My parents both ordered very obscure burger items like the one with jelly on it and the fancy bacon one. They enjoyed it and gave their leftovers to a homeless man because it was a large portion. Nice atmosphere and the server was great. Won't be visiting again though because it is very much a strict burger/meaty meat house.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Pj N.,"Knoxville, TN",12/28/2015,5.0,"Burgers and Whiskey (hence the ""livestock and whiskey barrel""). The concept itself is unique and genuine, especially for East Tennessee. But this isn't your ordinary burger place, because the food here is fantastic. You're going to pay anywhere from $10 to $16, but that's about what you'd expect from a semi-swanky place on Market Square. Plus, the high end of that price range is for the Bison Burger, which comes with a side of duck confit fries.And the whiskey selection is remarkable, and definitely the widest range of options in Knoxville. I didn't count, but I would say there are 100 or more. Scotch, Bourbon, Rye...options from $6 to $60 per pour.If you go around normal lunchtime (noon to 1), you're going to be waiting a while. Same goes for Friday or Saturday around dinner time. But if you go around 2pm, you'll get a table as soon as you walk in.I only recommend places where I go often, and this is one of those. It's a little expensive to go every day, but if I'm on a business lunch (or if someone else is picking up the tab), then sign me up."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ruthie M.,"Knoxville, TN",8/12/2014,5.0,"Yummy, slurp! We had the pimento cheese appetizer (loved the goat cheese in it). Then my husband and I split the Farmhouse burger,  1/2 order fries and onion rings, then had a s'mores milkshake for dessert. OMG! The beef was fresh and juicy. The onion rings' batter was light, similar to funnel cake batter. The coup de grace was the milkshake-superb. Don't miss it. What you can miss are the hand cut fries. Next time, I'll go with duck confit fries.  I am stuffed, and we are taking home half of the pimento cheese.  This is the best local food on Market Square."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dorothy P.,"Davidson, NC",4/14/2017,5.0,Outrageous burgers. We shared 2 burgers because we couldn't decide. The plain American would have been good too because the burger meat was so delicious. Totally worth the wait to sit outside.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jill K.,"Crawfordsville, IN",8/12/2017,5.0,"Delicious meal.  Duck fries, Elvis Burger and Shroomin all delicious!  Thank you, Jade for a great experience."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bryan D.,"Knoxville, TN",3/9/2018,4.0,Great burgers await. We have never had bad service or a bad meal. The wait staff is friendly and ready to help if you need it. The place is very small however and on busy nights and weekends it's difficult to get a table.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Danielle M.,"Pensacola, FL",7/9/2016,1.0,"So greasy, I got sick. There was some weird chemical-y taste to the burger. My server was nice, but not particularly fast either. I saw him after fiddling on my phone (as a single top) for about 5 minutes. The place itself would get 3 stars from me, but the burger (bacon cheddar) was awful."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Janeka H.,"Pineville, NC",1/29/2015,4.0,"So... This was my first time ever going here and I must say that the burger was good.  It wasn't the best burger ever...  But it was pretty darn good. The duck fries was really good.  It's a must get.  After finishing my lunch.... I ended my meal with a milkshake.  If I could rate this place based upon milkshakes, then they would have gotten a perfect 5.  I had the S'mores milkshake and my husband got the Nutella milkshake. They were both so good... That I wanted my milkshake and my husbands milkshake.  Seriously, the milkshakes were the best ever.  The next time I'm in Knoxville, I'm stopping here for their milkshakes.  And don't worry about parking, because there was a garage close by.  I don't know if parking is free or not, because I visited this restaurant on a holiday.  Even if it was a cost... I wouldn't have mind, because seriously.... Their milkshakes are just that good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Justin R.,"Durham, NC",2/15/2017,2.0,"A typical burger joint with typical food. A loud, stockyard-type atmosphere set the stage for the fare they serve here, namely whiskeys and burgers. I had the 'Merican burger, just a plain, no-frills kinda situation, and came away unimpressed. The quality of the meat seemed a little suspect, under seasoned and the bread was untoasted. UN-toasted. The fries were cooked well and their over salted quality paired well with the blandness of the meat. This might be a good restaurant for Knoxville and that's a little sad."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kons M.,"Chicago, IL",1/13/2019,4.0,"Friendly waitress and staff. I had the Greek lamb burger. It could use some more... something... but it was ok. It comes with their homemade tzatziki which was really good. Others had some of the other burgers which they really liked. I'm not a bourbon/whiskey fan so had beer. Good beer list. We also ordered the feta app which I would order again. The best thing was their S'more milk shake. Holy cow... one of the best shakes I've ever had. Even came with some roasted marshmallows. If in town, it's one of my first stops."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,India J.,"Knoxville, TN",5/14/2017,5.0,"You can tell someone had a dream to open up this restaurant, made it come true and treat it like their baby. We love it here fresh and made to order. Great whisky too and shout out to our waiter Josh!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brad W.,"St Paul, MN",11/28/2017,5.0,"Came here with my family around 4 PM on Friday the day of the Tree lighting and Christmas festivities. It was a Zoo around the park. We had 22 people with us. We called ahead and they said get there early. We checked in around 4pm and they were able to get 2 large tables put together within an hour and texted us when ready. I'm not sure if they usually do this, but it was greatly appreciated.We all ordered different burgers and nobody had one bad thing to say about their food other than being too full. Drinks were cold, burgers were hot and service was great. Great menu, great atmosphere and probably one of the best burgers I've ever tasted!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather S.,"Boulder City, NV",9/25/2016,5.0,Great burgers! You have to get the fried pickles when you are here. The Nutella milkshake is so yummy.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Daniel V.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",11/21/2017,5.0,This place is amazing for people who love burgers. I am a 14 year old from Arkansas and I love all type of cheese burgers (with bacon) always. They are people friendly and hey will make sure you get what you want. It is a kid friendly place and everyone will love it. Hope you enjoy. But on the down side there is to much lettuce in the burgers.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sharon M.,"Memphis, TN",7/18/2017,5.0,"I absolutely believe this is the best burger I ever ate! The pickles truly taste home made, and the onion rings were light and tasty. This is a small place with lots to offer--I will return the next time I am in Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael G.,"Sedona, AZ",11/17/2017,5.0,"In town on business and knew about this place from the last time I was here but it was so busy i ended up going somewhere else. Glad I stopped in for lunch there today! Probably the best black-and-blue burger I've ever had. All locally sourced produce and locally sourced, grass-fed beef. House made fries and onion rings are awesome too! Try the pimento cheese dip as an appetizer. Great service too.  Highly recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matt D.,"Belmont, NC",5/2/2017,5.0,I had the chicken and waffles. Amazing is the best way to sum it up. My co-worker had the steak house burger. Some of the best food we have both had in a long time ! This is a must eat place in Knoxville !
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Julie W.,"Indianapolis, IN",7/14/2015,5.0,"Stopped in here right when they opened a little after 11am. By 11:30 it was packed and on a wait! Great service, amazing food. We ordered the mushrooms for a starter - they were pretty good but I wouldn't waste the space because the burger is amazing. I was mad that I couldn't finish it all! I got the McLovin - bacon, pimento cheese, fried jalapeno, tomato, alioli. Amazing! Upgraded to the parm duck fat fries, and it was worth it. Great place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Steve R.,"Charleston, SC",4/13/2019,5.0,I had the Black and blue burger for lunch and it was a good tasting burger! I just wish it was later in the day so I could have got a whisky from their large delicious looking selection.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mark R.,"Solana Beach, CA",9/28/2016,5.0,First time visit....incredible. Had a Hurt Locker burger; probably one of the best burgers I've had in my life. Not exaggerating. Cooked to medium rare perfection...bacon was amazing. Had a lager from Virginia and a stout from Asheville - just super. I'll be back!!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mark M.,"Oak Ridge, TN",4/22/2017,5.0,"Just moved to town and some friends told me that this place was good, but they didn't tell me how good it actually was. Pretty reasonably priced food and drinks were well crafted. I got the mother clucker sandwich and it was gone in less than five minutes. It's dangerous how good this place was, I would come here every day"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Danny N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",11/21/2016,5.0,"Stock & Barrel lived up to very high expectations.  I was very excited to see the integration on Yelp with nowait which allowed us to get our spot in line when we were within 3 miles of the location.  The building offers a decent size bar and a few combination of seating options.  They easily accommodated my check in of 4 people with a wait time of around 30 minutes, so we waited at the bar.  I saw someone eating fried mushrooms which looked awesome, but I knew with the burger size I wouldn't be able to do both.  I ordered the farmhouse burger.  It is your typical farmhouse burger which includes a runny fried egg.  It was awesome.  My regret is I thought all fries were their duck fat fries.  I ordered the regular fries which were still very good, but the $1 extra duck fat fries looked even better.  My wife was happy with her burger that had pimento cheese on it as well.  We will definitely be back when in Knoxville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ryan E.,"Lakeland, FL",2/14/2016,4.0,"Grabbed dinner here before a Knoxville Ice Bears hockey game, which is a short 10-15 minute walk away at the Coliseum. I strongly suggest using the NoWait app to get your name on the waitlist before you arrive because the wait can be long (90 minutes for us on a Saturday at 5pm).My wife and I devoured the fried pickles to start, then enjoyed a couple of burgers and fries. She had the bacon cheeseburger, I had the Hurt Locker (bacon, pimiento cheese, fried green tomato,...). All in all, a tasty meal. Not sure yet if the burger ranks as highly on my list as some other favorites -- Holeman & Finch (Atlanta), Grindhouse (Atlanta), Burgatory (Pittsburgh), to name a few -- but if this is one of the best Knoxville has to offer, I'm not complaining.I will be back to try the duck confit fries. And the bourbon."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gretchen R.,"Needham, IN",12/7/2016,5.0,"9 times out of 10, I will choose chicken over beef. I don't know why...but I do. Except here. I cannot get enough beef here. I have had dreams about their burgers and don't get me started on their fries. Southern food is heavenly but this restaurant is doing something different. Some of the best burgers in town with an amazing environment. I don't think this is a group friendly place, small seating areas and tables but just grab your favorite two friends and chow down on some burgers."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Crazy G.,"Knoxville, TN",1/21/2017,4.0,This place was great! Id have given 5 stars if my food was a bigger portion(seemed a bit small) but it was amazing!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah P.,"Detroit, MI",1/20/2015,5.0,This place is delectable! Go for the whiskey flight so you can try several at a time. Then when you pair that with one of their amazing burgers...perfection. I highly recommend the mushrooms appetizer. An excellent balance of sweet honey on fried mushrooms and a side of mustard. I went for the bison which was served with duck confit fries. Burger was great. Fries were decent but Needed more duck. Good flavor though. An excellent find in Knoxville.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shu T.,"Taipei, Taiwan",12/18/2016,4.0,"Came here for lunch and I ordered ""the Greek"" burger. It was delicious and had great sauce. My bf ordered a Kentucky bourbon ale, which didn't have that strong of a bourbon taste and wasn't too bitter. The atmosphere is chill and service was good. Burgers aren't cheap, but it was worth it. I thought the duck confit fries was just ok. Probably wouldn't get them again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Olivia P.,"Knoxville, TN",3/31/2019,5.0,Awesome burgers! Just wish they had another location. We don't go often anymore because it's just so busy! But the food is outstanding
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ross M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/19/2016,5.0,Stock and Barrel has a great selection of food and drinks. It is constantly busy which speaks for itself
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Valerie N.,"Atlanta, GA",2/9/2014,1.0,"I was ecstatic to try Stock and Barrel after my friend recommended it for a First Friday downtown. See, I'm from Knoxville originally and never seem to get downtown when I come home to visit the fam. After looking at the menu  (yay! Locally sourced!) and reading yelp reviews, I knew I would have a terrific, fun meal there... And perhaps wait a bit for it. We got to Stock and Barrel later than we meant to - and the whole walk there, I marveled at the Market Square I barely recognized. We checked in a bit after 7pm and were told it would be an hour to 1.5 hours max, but they were sure they would seat us. We left our name, they promised to text, and so began our walk around the square and a visit to downtown grill to wait, seeing as there was absolutely positively no place to wait inside Stock and Barrel. At an hour and 20 minutes (with no text), we walked back so we would hit the 1.5 hour mark on the nose. Imagine my utter shock when they told me it would be at least another hour (I.e. Seated after 10pm), if we were even seated. My mouth dropped open. The hostess rudely swung around the iPad to show the long list of names ahead of us and began pointing at just how many tables would be seated before we ever would be. I also noticed the time of 90+ minutes next to our name. Then she essentially folded her arms and stared us down. Um, hi? That's it? No apology? At all?  No, ""sorry we didn't text an update to let you know..."" No, ""gosh it's way busier tonight than we expected - maybe we can give you a 25% off coupon to come back another time?"" Where was the manager and/or owner who should have realized the disaster going down at the hostess stand and been there to soothe the stressed (potential) clientele?Listen: I knew ponying up to this place at 7ish on a First Friday was risky but how/why could a place that's been open for months be so waaaay off in calculating table turnover that they mistook an hour wait for a 2.5+ hours wait, and then not apologize at all for the error?Luckily I wasn't that hungry so I wasn't hangry enough to make a scene but I'm sure someone before or after me did. It's no way to do business, especially when OpenTable and other online reservation systems exist (not to mention the old-fashioned system of call ahead). I reallllllllly wanted to patron Stock and Barrel, but even Thomas Keller and the French Laundry didn't make me wait 2.5+ hours to eat his amazing food. I'm not sure how many customers S&B lost Friday night but I guarantee had S&B had a reservations system that told me it was fully booked, I would have shrugged my shoulders and tried it another time. Instead, thanks to making me spend 1.5 hours of my Friday in a hold pattern and then subjecting me to a super apathetic hostess, I won't be back (and gosh, if the hostess stand is that unpleasant, what's the wait staff like???).For this, I must leave one star. I spent enough time with you that would warrant a normal meal time, S&B. I must also add that my burger craving was satiated right down the road, via my patty melt and Mac & cheese that I was quickly served after being promptly seated at the Bijou was AMAZING. And there was live jazz. Thank goodness for them for giving me the awesome First Friday experience Knoxvillians deserve!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Missy E.,"Yorktown, VA",2/8/2017,5.0,"In town from VA for a volleyball tourney and chose this place off of their reviews. All we (table of 6) could say was WOW! We had tried the mushrooms as an appetizer---great portion to share and feed all 6 of us, Chicken sandwiches, burgers, salad with salmon burger, and chicken tenders (that were not on the menu but they accommodated our picky ""only eats chicken tenders"" friend). Waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable of the area (she pointed us in the direction of a spirits store..BONUS). Everything was AMAZING and Thank You!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie R.,"Atlanta, GA",2/26/2014,5.0,"I had my first experience here four days ago but it's still fresh in my mind as the best dinner I have had since I moved to Knoxville.The host said the wait was an hour long when I arrived with my date. There was no hesitation to add us to the waiting list via the hype my roommate gave me when he suggested this spot earlier. Since this was in Market Square it wouldn't be hard to find other places to hang out until our table was ready. We walked down to Soccer Taco to watch a game while I enjoyed a couple whiskey diets, my usual drink. We returned shortly before the hour mark. The host is supposed to text you when your table is ready. I like this feature because it doesn't involve a clunky disc device that you need to hold nor do you have to wait for your name to be called. I asked the host if we could be seated even though we did not receive a text notification yet and a couple minutes later we had the perfect table.I can't seem to remember our waiters name but he was fantastic. Very attentive and fun to be around. From an outsiders view it might look like I knew this guy personally by how friendly he was.I had the pleasure of enjoying a drink that I eyed on the specials menu when I walked in. I saw the words Makers Mark and muddled strawberries and was sold instantly. When you have the selection of over 50 different bourbons you're going to have a very excited Katie. They even had Four Roses which is an US export only liquor unless purchased directly from the distillery in Louisville. So awesome.Our waiter talked up the Elk meat as a prime choice for whichever burger we selected. I never had it before so I trusted his suggestion. The thing is that now I have a very bad problem. I'm in love with Elk meat. I want it on every burger for the rest of my life until I die. Not only did I have delicious medium rare meat for my mouth to enjoy but it's healthy too. This restaurant works with a local farm in Blaine, TN for their grass fed, hormone free delectables. For a fitness health nut like myself.. This is perfect for my food source preferences. The only thing that could possibly make this any more beautiful would be peanut butter.. Oh but wait what's this? A slice of peanut butter pie for dessert? I don't care how happy my tummy already is at this point please give this to me NOW. And so my date and I shared a happy ending together while I decided that this was in fact my new favorite restaurant in Knoxville. The end."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alison B.,"Fairfield, OH",6/7/2017,4.0,"Very good service.  All of us had burgers and were pleased.  But,  order a doneness level up from your usual.  All were a little more pink than we preferred.  Fries are seasoned which didn't make the kids happy."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Susan S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/8/2017,5.0,"Best burger in Knoxville! They have creative combinations that include a variety of meats (lamb, bison, turkey, and beef) and toppings - too many to list. My favorite is the farmhouse with barrel aged cheddar, fried egg, benton's bacon, tomatoes, and onion on a garlic roll. They have a couple of good vegetarian options too. Beef and buns are locally sourced. Fries are hand cut.  Atmosphere is casual and upbeat in Market Square. Gets very crowded during prime hours so we also go during ""off"" hours."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brad W.,"Winchester, KY",10/7/2017,5.0,"At the tail end of a bigger trip my wife and I found ourselves with a few hours to kill in Knoxville's Market Square.  I had researched the trip and found a Reddit threat entitled ""If you only had time to eat at one place in Knoxville?"", and Stock & Barrel was hands down the winner.  My wife was reluctant to try because she ""wasn't in the mood for a burger"", but after looking at a few other places in the Square my suggestion won out.  I had the incredible ""Buffalo"" burger, and she had the ""Farmhouse"".  We were both blown away about the quality of the burger, but the fries were the absolute stand out.  In spite of the fact that my burger came with a full-sized order of the Duck Confit Fries, we also got a whole extra order as an appetizer.  Those fries were a game changer.  My only regret, was not having a nearby hotel room allowing me to slip into a duck-fat coma for a few hours before attempting the long drive back home to Kentucky."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Seth T.,"Knoxville, TN",10/6/2017,5.0,"I eat here 3-4 times a week and love the fresh ingredients in every dish. The chicken schnitzel sandwich is amazing and their sides are homemade deliciousness. BBQ on the weekends is supposed to be next level but I'm holding off til I exhaust all other choices, so I have a week or so. LOL!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Teresa W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",5/28/2017,5.0,Absolutely the best burgers!!! Amazing whiskey selection and tasty drinks! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Knoxville area.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Deanna A.,"Murfreesboro, TN",1/26/2017,5.0,Had lunch with my best friend yesterday and he took me out for the best burger.  It was perfectly cooked and was super juicy. We had the fried pickles to start and those were absolutely amazing as well. The table however seemed a bit small but the plate fit.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah W.,"Atlanta, GA",1/11/2019,5.0,"Craving a really good burger, and this certainly was.  I had the Bernie, as recommended here, and it was delicious.  My son had the Billy (took me awhile to figure out the goat connection), also good.  Liked the option to get half and half sides.  The pimento cheese app was my favorite.  I want to figure out how to make at home."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Boy H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/26/2016,4.0,"Pretty good and definitely the most exotic in terms of offering a wide variety of meats.  If you want something in the form of a burger that is completely out of the ordinary, this is definitely the place to dine. Finally, I have yet meet anyone who has eaten here that hasn't raved.  However, be forewarned, the experience doesn't come cheap... Then again, perhaps it shouldn't."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessica S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/20/2016,4.0,Needs to expand the side option choices. Love the draft beer selection and the cozy atmosphere. They also have alfresco dining. The burgers are great.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Renee O.,"Naperville, IL",2/17/2017,5.0,Delicious tomato salad. Salmon burger was great. Moist with great flavor. The server made good recommendation for bourbon too!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jody C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/19/2016,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants in town. Big, delicious burgers. The Hurt Locker is my go-to. I've had almost everything on the menu, it's all good. Even had some vegetarian friends that said that Stock & Barrel has the best black bean burger in town. Same room for their desserts. The s'mores milkshake is absolutely ridiculous! I'm on the edge of eating four a day, ballooning up. Worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jenny R.,"Atherton, CA",6/21/2016,4.0,"The burger was fantastic!!!  However, the truffle fries were lacking. I'm not sure if they used old oil on them.  The bourbon tasting was also excellent.  I would go back and skip the fries."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Court J.,"Webster, NY",1/6/2014,5.0,"This is literally the best burger I have ever eaten at a restaurant. From New York to Florida and then to California the ""Farmhouse"" burger takes 1st prize!  The farm fresh meat I believe is the best you can find with no hormones in it like you find elsewhere. The fries are also quite amazing with the garlic aioli as well as the onion rings. The service is good but the food can be a little slow.  I like to think they are taking their time to make it excellent. Unbelievably, after I heard about them, I went there for dinner, then lunch the next day, and twice that week to bring friends.  Absolutely everyone agreed with me that this has the best burgers in Knoxville.  Not one plate at the table had a crumb left on it.   Pricey burgers,  but You get what you pay for!Fantastic selection of burgers, cheeses, toppings.  Very unique combinations in their custom burgers that if you are adventurous you could eat a different burger every day for several weeks! Great atmosphere to enjoy for lunch or dinner in Market Square.   This will soon be Knoxville 's most popular place for a gourmet burger. Love, this place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Court J.,"Webster, NY",1/5/2014,5.0,"This is literally the best burger I have ever eaten at a restaurant. From New York to Florida and then to California the farmhouse burger takes 1st prize!  The farm fresh meat I believe is the best you can find with no hormones and crap in it like you find elsewhere.

I literally went there for dinner one night, then lunch the next day and twice that week to bring friends and everyone agreed with me.  Not one plate had a crumb left on it.   Pricey burgers,  but You get what you pay for!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Harrison S.,"Orlando, FL",4/23/2017,5.0,"Best burger joint in town! This was my second visit to Stock and Barrel and I was even more impressed than my first visit. Fast, friendly service and the food was excellent! The place is kinda small and it was packed, but it still only took about 25 minutes for us to be seated. If you like burgers and a cool atmosphere, this is the place for you! I highly recommend the Bernie burger!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nathan B.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",8/23/2017,1.0,"My company bought 4 gift cards there at Christmas for employee gifts. I got one. When I tried to use it, they would not honor it. No notice of expiration, and less than a year from purchase. Food is good, but Do NOT buy a gift card."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tyler A.,"Roanoke, VA",8/20/2017,5.0,"Get the Billy or the Bernie and you'll be in burger heaven. Upgrade your fries to duck confit for $2 more, you won't regret it. Honestly, one of the best burgers I've ever eaten, the billy with its tomato jam and goat cheese and the Bernie with its blackberry jam. Theres nothing like it, it definitely lives up to its rave reviews."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sammy O.,"San Francisco, CA",10/29/2016,5.0,Was told they have the best burger in town!! And have to say they do!! Great drinks and food!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shawn K.,"Winter Garden, FL",12/8/2016,5.0,"The Bernie burger is a must! The combo of flavors sounds a little strange, but they work together very well. Sat at the bar and had wonderful service from both the bar staff."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bobby M.,"Golden, CO",1/17/2016,5.0,Had the gyro burger which was off the menu. It's was good. The meat was prepared medium well and it was very good and juicy. Fries were very good.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Emily J.,"Muncie, IN",5/17/2016,4.0,"Stock and Barrel has amazing burgers (I've never had one I didn't like). Don't overlook the chicken and waffles, though! (Crispy breaded boneless chicken breast, thick-cut bacon, and crisp, buttery waffles all brought together with a maple-Dijon mustard sauce). The bourbon peanut butter pie is worth a taste too, as are the duck confit fries!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Fit G.,"Sugar Land, TX",12/2/2016,5.0,"Didn't eat there, but the bartender was the BEST. He was so friendly and helpful. He's only there Friday thru Sunday so I can't speak for the other days. Anyway, loved my experience here!!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Steve G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/3/2016,4.0,"I've lived in Knoxville my entire life and this is easily the best burger and whiskey selection I've found. Don't expect to get into this place easily for dinner, but if you're willing to wait it's well worth a visit."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brandon C.,"Wake Forest, NC",12/22/2015,1.0,"Let's see where to begin. The host staff...unprofessional. Giggly laughing about wait times then telling us how many parties in front of us then there's absolutely no accuracy to it; two parties in front, four parties seated and then there's still two parties in front. Just not a good way to start the experience. Reflects poor management and training. Regardless of how busy you are...be honest and transparent  with the customer."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paige B.,"New York, NY",7/17/2017,5.0,"Love, love, love! The burgers are so yummy. They have a great variety of burgers to choose from. The duck fries are to die for. Highly recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike R.,"Chicago, IL",7/16/2017,5.0,Incredible food and microbrews. Went on a busy Saturday night and was seated quickly. Food came quickly. Wait staff is attentive and knowledgeable. Will be back when I'm in Knoxville in September. And get a shake to go. So good.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rebekah B.,"Parkersburg, WV",12/22/2016,4.0,"Found us a table quickly, despite being late and crowded. Service was attentive but not overbearing, which was appropriate for the atmosphere. Nevertheless I never had an empty glass. Seating is a bit tight, but it didn't bother the group I was with. Classic rock playing quietly in the background added a nice ambience. Really nice selection of whiskies and beer. I had a chicken sandwich topped with bourbon onions, and it was excellent. The fries weren't really anything special, but good.  Great way to start a night out."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Channa P.,"Seattle, WA",11/6/2013,4.0,"I have to admit the first time I attempted to eat here they really ticked me off. On a very busy night downtown they took my name, phone number, and quoted me 45 mins-hour. Two hours later (while eating sushi up the street) my phone got a text my table was ready. It was laughable.This past Monday night I arrived to another 45 minute wait, but this time there were two seats at the bar!! Once seated everything was golden. The bartender got our beers quickly and my friend and I got the crab dip to start. It's pretty awesome, and it comes with these great zesty potato chips. I think  they use paprika. Anyway, we waited slightly longer than I would like, but when that Billy Goat Burger came it was love at first bite. Goat cheese, bacon, tomato jam, and an insanely big, juicy patty. It was worth all my dollars and I could barely eat half. Did I mention they use local, grass fed beef and local produce.So go, expect a wait because the place is a coffin, and order a fun burger. Bacon-cheddar is why they have Five Guys."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Colin R.,"Knoxville, TN",2/11/2016,5.0,It took a while to get in but I know that's not necessarily their fault as they are trying to upgrade to a larger establishment. I had the best burger that I've probably ever had in my life. I honestly have not been able to have a burger at any other establishment between Knoxville and Atlanta. Almost cursed from having a burger here now everything else is mediocre. Definitely stop by here if going through Knoxville
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Eric M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/14/2017,5.0,"Best burgers in town bar none. Have tried several of them and have never been disappointed. The duck fat fries are incredible. Probably the 2nd best bourbon selection in town from places I have been. The bourbon is a bit privy compared to other places, but the bourbon flights do offer a good value."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John B.,"Jacksboro, TN",4/27/2016,5.0,My favorite burger in Knoxville! Get there early - it fills up fast.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chelsi H.,"Joelton, TN",3/18/2016,4.0,"Had to wait two hours for a table on a Friday night, but the weather was nice so it wasn't too bad. Hung at the bar across from S&B for most of the time. Had read a lot of reviews about the confit fries, but opted for the onion rings instead which were perfectly crispy and not greasy. I got the steakhouse burger, asked for medium, came out more like medium rare, but was still delicious. The steak sauce (A1) got to be a little overpowering the last couple bites, but it helped mellow it out with a side of house made ranch to dip in. (Fresh made ranch is a huge plus in my book). Husband got the  farmhouse burger and his was perfectly medium with a nice runny egg, super messy and very tasty. Waiter was really nice and attentive. Food came out within 15 min of ordering which made the 2 hour wait not as bad. Would definitely go back, maybe on a weekday before dinner rush though."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,April R.,"Maryville, TN",7/23/2016,4.0,"Just a tip...these burgers are HUGE. I had the 'Merican and split it with a friend. Overall, the burger was good and the atmosphere was nice. The only downside is you are seated very close to other patrons so you're basically sitting with other people."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tami L.,"Fenton, MO",6/9/2017,5.0,"We were in town overnight in Knoxville. Went downtown and ate at The Stock and Barrel. Literally The BEST burger I have ever had, actually thinking of stopping again on our way back through town heading home from vacation!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Steven H.,"Latham, NY",7/6/2016,4.0,"Excellent burgers, a cool vibe, and a well-stocked bar with an excellent array of bourbons await at the S&B. I went straight arrow with the Classic Bacon Burger accompanied by an awesome tomato/olive/feta salad. Was unable to finish it. My only suggestion would be for them to go a bit deeper and broader on the craft beer options, which were disappointingly limited and uninspiring."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Laura M.,"Lexington, KY",8/31/2017,4.0,"I decided to try this place out while I was walking around market square. The burgers are to die for! My mouth is watering just thinking about them. My server was Cara, she was absolutely adorable and quirky. I was having such a good time I wound up staying a bit longer than I expected and wound up a little tipsy . My husband was very happy about that . I raved so much about the burgers that he made me go back the next day so he could try one for himself!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sabrina C.,"Hartsdale, NY",8/26/2017,5.0,Peanut butter and banana burger! You would never think but yeah it's pretty epic! Your stomach will be happy too!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joseph L.,"Jacksonville, NC",5/27/2017,5.0,"Amazing atmosphere and customer service, our server Josh was extremely attentive. I don't think I've finished a whole burger in a few years, but this burger was definitely worth the food belly, accompanied by a delicious Manhattan. Would recommend this 10/10."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mark B.,"Jacksonville, FL",9/30/2017,3.0,"While here for work for a day. I was brought here by a fun bunch from work. This place was also recommended by a friend that I hold his option on food quite high. So this was a very busy night cause of some latin fest going on. We got a large table inside and I stared at their menu and it is pretty much all burgers with some salads and sides mixed in. I noticed that they have one of my favorite apps. Fried mushrooms with a horseradish sauce. Now this was really good and huge in size. I went for their ""Billy"" burger with the goat cheese and benton's bacon. I ordered it mid rare but it came out more middle well. Real close to going back but I was with a group and I didn't want to hold up everyone. The burger had good flavors it was just overcooked. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their burgers and the duck fries were mighty tasty.  It would have been a good night if the cook would have been right. So maybe next time I'm back in town I will try it again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Loftis B.,"Philadelphia, TN",9/14/2013,5.0,"Our party of three (50-something parents, 20-year-old son) had an enlightening meal at Stock and Barrel. We arrived a little after 5:00 on a Friday in September and were immediately seated inside near the kitchen. Our server was excellent, because when we told him that the 50-somethings were counting calories, he immediately said that we could substitute something for fries. However, we were splitting the burger, and if you're going to splurge, you might as well have the fries. We were not sorry.Our son ordered the Chicken and Waffle.My husband had a shot of Knob Creek Rye, a rye on his ""must try"" list.We would have liked to try appetizers and what not, but -- yeah, counting the calories.Look, when you're seriously trying to watch what you're eating, you think long and hard before you indulge in extra calories. I'm cautious. I have to be.So -- that said -- my half of the Classic Bacon Burger was the best hamburger I've ever had. The bun is excellent. The beef is excellent. The tomato was homegrown. The bourbon onion, which I presume is big chunks of sweet onion pickled in some kind of bourbon brine, is excellent. The pickle? Oh, my gosh. If they put those pickles in jars and sold them, they'd make a killing. I skipped the mayo and added spicy brown mustard to my sandwich. All put together, it was just divine. I'm sitting here drooling, just thinking about it.I told my husband, ""This is the best hamburger I've ever eaten.""He said, ""You're hurting my feelings.""(He grills hamburgers often. And they're very good. But they're not as good as the Stock and Barrel Classic Bacon Burger.)Our son across the table was declaring his Chicken and Waffle to be the best *meal* he ever ate.I said he was hurting *my* feelings. (You should see the spread I turn out for Thanksgiving.)Then he shared an onion ring with me, and a bite of that divine chicken and waffle sandwich, and I had to concede that he might be right.Was it perfect? No. It's a little warm in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen, and I had to ask for more ice with my tea. Oo. I'm scandalized. Oh, wait, no, I'm trying to come up with a reason not to go back today for lunch. Nope, I fail. I'm going back as soon as humanly possible. And that, considering the calories involved, is no small compliment. That's how good Stock and Barrel is. It's worth the calories.ETA: I went back for lunch. I had the Wedge Salad with a grilled chicken breast. OMG. Divine all over again. The balsamic reduction is insane; the buttermilk bleu cheese dressing could precipitate a new religion. The Benton's Bacon is thick, smoky, and chewy. Highly recommend!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Danielle A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",9/27/2015,5.0,"Favorite place in Market square. Bourbon wall must be worth over $15,000 alone, so you can be you'll find something you've never seen, tried, or heard of. Cocktail list updated regularly per the season, burgers and buns on point, and a phenomenal bourbon peanut butter pie. Can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Great service too. Try a flight of bourbon if you can't make up your mind."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amy W.,"San Antonio, TX",5/19/2017,5.0,We had the Mother Clucker with the fried chicken and it was amazing. So delicious. My son had the Hurt Locker and my husband had the Greek. Everyone loved their food. Our service was great too. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table and it was well worth the wait! My only complaint was the chairs are not comfortable.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chris C.,"San Diego, CA",5/18/2017,5.0,"I had the bison burger with duck confeit fries. The burger was awesome! The fries were a tad greasy, but very good. Great service as well!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chad G.,"Englewood, CO",7/30/2016,5.0,Hands down my favorite burger and whiskey spot in the square. Very busy so expect a wait. The duck confit fries are stupid good. Burgers have always been cooked to perfection.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Carol P.,"Maineville, OH",7/16/2016,5.0,"My husband and I got the beer battered onion rings for appetizer not realizing the burger came with fries! They were delicious, some of the best I have ever had, the burgers were so good and the fries, just got so full! I had the McLovins burger my husband got the Bison burger topping on a reg beef burger, great burgers. We were there for early dinner and the place was busy, service very good also."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Diana G.,"Knoxville, TN",3/30/2016,3.0,"I'm a fan of the great burgers they have! So good and different from any burger place. The only thing that keeps me from give this place a 5 star, is the servers are extremely slow. (Working in the serves industry myself, this is a major part of dining anywhere.) I went in on a Tuesday around 4:00. Use and 2 other tables were inside. Our waitress was horribly slow! Thought it was a one time thing. Came back on a Wednesday, around 1:00 and again. Super slow on a none busy time."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dee O.,"Knoxville, TN",10/8/2013,4.0,This place makes some pretty yummy gourmet burgers. I have not been disappointed by the quality of the food. I have always gotten the vegetarian burger (black beans) but you can change your toppings and make it a slightly different meal as often as you want. Service has also been stepped up a ton. The ladies at the bar have always been fantastic. This place is definitely a solid place to grab a meal. It is great place to be on game day.  And you should definitely try a milkshake :)
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dee O.,"Knoxville, TN",8/25/2013,3.0,"I ate here the second day it opened. This place has the potential to be a 4 or 5 star place and I hope to be able to update my review soon. The biggest take home is that our burgers were delicious. I had the deadhead burger which was just awesome. One of the best rendition of a vegetarian burger I have ever had. My friend's burger was also very good although I don't quite remember which one she had. We both loved our meals. My bourbon fizz was excellently made and well priced. They are dog friendly too, which is always a big plus. I think the best part of the meal was the Tomato Head buns that came with the burgers. Like anything associated with the Tomato Head, it was excellent. What took away from this experience probably had a lot to do with opening a new restaurant. Our waitress did not put in the appetizer order until our meals were brought out. They ran out of stuff to make my friend's cocktail. They only had 2 out of the four milkshakes on the menu. Of course, they didnt have the one my friend really wanted to try.  It took them almost 20 minutes to get drink orders from friends of mine who randomly ended up sitting at the table next to us. Little understandable things that could be easily fixed. Bottom line is that I will visit again. Likely soon. I really enjoyed my burger and the side of fries it came with."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Beth G.,"Cincinnati, OH",10/21/2016,5.0,"What a delicious restaurant. We had the pimento cheese and the bison burger with duck confit fries and they were all amazing! They source their meat locally, including the bison. I have pretty high expectations for restaurants and this met my expectations in many ways-highly recommend it!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Richard P.,"Chattanooga, TN",10/18/2016,5.0,You have to try the Black & Bleu Burger...it was amazing!!!  Great bourbon and beer selection.  A must stop when visiting Knoxville.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel H.,"Manchester, TN",2/9/2016,5.0,"Got the salmon burger. It was good. The onion rings are some of the best I've had in Knoxville. Decent beer selection. The whiskey selection seemed impressive as well, though I am by no means an expert. The only problem is getting in. We went on a Friday night (mistake number 1) and had to sit at the bar, and we were lucky to get that. Come at a slow time if you can, or come willing to wait."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Emari M.,"La Mesa, CA",4/28/2017,4.0,"Great food, great service from the servers,good selection of beers and whiskey.  Only complaint is the snotty hostess.  Would give five stars if not for them.  Normally restaurants want their first impressions to be friendly and welcoming- not so with the one who greets you at the hostess stand.  After waiting a short 15 minute wait for a ""first available table, we asked if one of the outdoor tables could be ours.  We were told,""we have people who called in and wanted the outdoor table who were coming in.""  Oh well- we settled on the indoor (loud) table indoors instead.Next night we had four more joining us.  I called ahead to see if we could get our names in the waitlist.  I was told they didn't do that.  I immediately  told the hostess,""that's strange, last night I couldn't sit at a table because you said some people who called in would get the table outside."" She then said those guests from yesterday were walk ins who put their names in the list.  I was annoyed and hung up as that was not what they said yesterday- hence why I called in this day- thinking we could put our names on the list.My cohorts really wanted to try out the place so we went anyway.  For a party of five- one hour and 30 minute wait.  We waited- and waited- and waited.... finally one of our party asked hostess about the wait time remaining.  We were told our party of eight would be a little longer.  The hostess was corrected that we were a party of five- and we're sat then and there- how do you mix up ""five"" with ""eight?""    Our wait was so much longer than it should have been.  To error is human, to not apologize is arrogant and immature.Food was amazing.  Service wax great.  Hostesses not so much.  Too bad they're the gateway to the good stuff.  Only in Knoxville for a few days.  Glad I ate here- too bad I'll steer other known visitors away because if those who control the seating.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michelle A.,"Spanish Fort, AL",4/23/2017,5.0,"The best burger I have ever eaten, and I am not a burger person. Apart from the very interesting toppings, the burger meat itself was so deliciously, flavorful! Yumm! We were passing through on a long road trip, which my husband said after eating ""I was cursing you before about why we couldn't just stop off the interstate, but man that hit the spot!  That was great!"" Please note this place was literally 3 minutes from I40, in a very hip part of downtown.  There was a little wait for a table, but to my surprise, TN allows children under 21 to sit at the bar! Best decision ever!  The cute young blonde behind the bar was so friendly, helpful, and a wealth of knowledge regarding the food, beer, and bourbon menu!  Absolutely wonderful service, food,  and atmosphere, we will go back when we are in town again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christian K.,"Fort Sanders, Knoxville, TN",7/20/2017,5.0,"Phenomenal burger, good price, even better vibe. By far one of best retardants in market square! Also their smore milkshake was delicious!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sheri W.,"Villa Rica, GA",10/6/2014,5.0,"Excellent Food! The Pimento/ goat cheese appetizer was delicious, great burger, craft beer, and the staff is friendly and helpful."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelly R.,"Nolensville, TN",7/21/2016,5.0,"We heard this place was great, and yes it is!!! Our burgers were delicious, buns perfect and we had the Duck Confit fries on the side.  We sat at the bar at lunch time, service was perfect.  Come get your guilty pleasure!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessica R.,"Knoxville, TN",12/16/2014,4.0,"It's a small restaurant, so it can feel crowded easily. The burgers, however, are worth the hype. They use Benton's bacon, a Maple Bourbon Mustard for their Chicken and Waffles, and their Garlic Aioli is mouth wateringly delicious. Really, just reading through all the original kinds of burgers you can try is worth the trip alone. If you want a beverage, stick to the bourbon since that is what they're known for. Their beer and wine selection is mediocre and overpriced."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cathy C.,"Palm Coast, FL",12/29/2018,5.0,If I could give it 10 stars I would!  My husband and I were passing through Knoxville and stopped in for lunch. We had the crab dip with pita chips as an appetizer and split the buffalo burger with duck confit fries.  OMG! The burger was the BEST we've ever had!  Don't think twice! Just go!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Erich G.,"Knoxville, TN",10/23/2015,1.0,"Among the all time worst hospitality experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.  Not for the food - we never got to try that - but for the experience and service.I had a group of 7 visiting wanted to show off downtown Knoxville and come to Market square at 6:30pm.   I called the restaurant at 5:50 asking if they do call ahead or take reservations for large parties.  They said no but they have an app to get in the queue and told me to download it.  I gave them my name anyhow and told them we would be there at 6:30.  I downloaded the ""No Wait"" app for my iPhone only to discover that the app reported that they had no wait so come on in - perfect I thought.  I left west Knoxville to head downtown at 6:10 and tried the app again.  This time it said there was a 40 minute wait.  What a difference 20 minutes makes!  So I tried to use the app to put us in the queue. Alas, after selecting 7+ for the number in my party the app reported that it didn't support using the app for that size party and I should call the restaurant to get in the queue - which is what I tried to do 20 minutes earlier!  I called back and got the same person I talked to before.  She said to just enter 6 people and she would fix it.  I asked if they can actually take a party of 8 and she assured me no problem.  By this time it is 6:20 and I went back into the app, selected 6 people and got in the queue - still a 40 minute wait reported.  We got there promptly at 6:30 and checked in at the hostess stand.  Still a 40 minute wait - so I went from no wait when I first called and gave my name which would have had us sitting right at 6:30, to a 40 minute at 6:10 (seating at 6:50), 40 minutes at 6:20 (seating at 7), and now 40 minutes at 6:30 (seating at 7:10).  Now I see that this place has only 12 tables in the place.  I can't believe the hostess told us they could handle a party of 8!  We went to the bar and had some bourbon.  The drinks were good and the bartender was excellent - the only good thing to happen.  I went to check the app again at 6:50 and discovered that it now said we were not in line any more. WTF!  I went to the hostess stand and she said we were still on her list with a 30 minute wait but now there was another party of 8 ahead of us!  How did another party of 8 get ahead of us?  We checked again at 7:15 - still a 30 minute wait.  This was getting out of hand.  At 7:20 I reminded the hostess that I first asked to be put in the queue at 6:50 and asked how many other parties have been waiting 90 minutes?  No response let alone a manager coming to offer an apology.  At 7:30 we were told that we were next.  I didn't believe it so I told the hostess that we were leaving if not seated in the next ten minutes.  We sent my wife to check out other restaurants in Market Square to see if they could take a party of 8.  She came back and reported that Not Watsons could take us immediately.  We waited until 7:45 and with no sign of being seated we left for Not Watsons.  Again, the staff didn't seem to care.  No comment let alone an apology.  Needless to say we will never be back and Stock & Barrel has been removed from our corporate list of Knoxville restaurants for our visiting guests.Not Watson's was fantastic!  They made the visit memorable for my guests.  I will write that review next!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kara C.,"Miamisburg, OH",2/17/2016,5.0,"We absolutely loved this place! We came down for a work convention . They welcomed all of us so nicely.  I highly recommend the duck confit fries with garlic ! Holy moly they are delicious!! Also the consensus from the group was the stuffed mushrooms, the burgers and the spicy crab dip was AMAZING!!!!Our waiter Drew was such a champ and truly gave us southern hospitality !!!! We thank you so much !!! I'd recommend this place every time you come to Knoxville"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Meg R.,"Buford, GA",10/25/2015,5.0,Wonderful food and service. We took our 7 year old and it was a little too loud for him. Our bad. The Nutella milkshake with s'mores topping was insanely good. We will be back!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kathleen F.,"Carmel, NY",9/22/2016,5.0,"I came here for lunch today with low expectations as I'm gluten free and thus, expected to get just a normal cheeseburger with gluten free bun with no sides as I do at a lot of burger in a basket places. However, I was quickly proven wrong--I had the grilled Mother Clucker and it was beyond amazing. The bun wasn't quite a cornbread corn bread, but worked really well with the dressing, greens, tomato and--the best part--bourbon onions. I was also able to get a side of corn and black bean salad, which complimented the sandwich very nicely. My server was very pleasant and attentive, kept up with the sweet tea refills. If I'm ever back in Knoxville, Stock & Barrel is my first stop."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Makayla R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/8/2015,5.0,"The most amazing burger and fries I've ever had! I got the bison burger cooked medium, and when I say it was the best, it was the BEST! My fiancé orders their Elvis burger and he is also a huge fan. Hes never found a true Elvis burger before Stock and Barrel. The beer selection is nice, they have a hard cider which is what I look for and they even offer wine, but this is the place to go for whiskey! It took up the whole back page of the drink menu. The venue isn't huge but you don't need the space for the food to taste great. Market square is already nice to sit outside anyway. Plus around 3pm the outside seating is perfectly shaded. The best burger I've ever had, and I'm not a burger person!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Krista C.,"Foggy Bottom, Washington, DC",9/22/2016,4.0,"Stayed in Knoxville for the night and decided to check out this place because of the good reviews. We enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was good. The portions are huge! I could not finish my side or burger - and neither could my friends. Our waitress was incredibly kind. Afterwards, we went across the street to Preservation Pub to check out the live music. A solid evening. Definitely worth visiting."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Justa G.,"Knoxville, TN",9/1/2013,4.0,"I think this place will fit well into downtown Knoxville. I went with friends & we had a blast! The bourbon menu has a lot to offer & burgers were great! In my group we had a farmhouse burger, the Elvis, and the Deadhead (for the vegetarian ) burger.  Service was slow but the place was busy! We still got exactly what we ordered despite the slowness. The kinks will have to be worked out of a new restaurant of course. I am excited about this new place! It's a great concept!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah F.,"Fayetteville, AR",10/4/2015,5.0,Absolutely amazing!!! We went on a game day and the wait was 30 minutes but we were told by other customers it was totally worth the wait and let me tell you it was!!! Customer service was amazing! We went back again after the game! They stayed open late to accommodated us. Twice in two nights that should tell you something. Don't pass this up!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Solyanaa G.,"Mount Juliet, TN",8/3/2016,5.0,Easily my favorite burger spot in Knoxville. I believe I've had every single burger by now and I'd have to say that the Greek is the best
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Roy Te T.,"St Simons Island, GA",10/8/2015,5.0,"Came to Knoxville to check another location off my SEC football stadia bucket list.  Thanks Yelpers for the recommendation!  Great bar.  Great food.  Great whisky.  I got the mother clucker and the chicken breast was so big, I took half the sandwich back to the hotel (and I'm a big guy)."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ryan T.,"Miami Beach, FL",10/24/2015,5.0,Best burgers I've had in Knoxville. Make sure to put your party's name down early though.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Andrea W.,"Knoxville, TN",7/29/2016,5.0,"The best burger and fries I've ever had. Better than Shake Shack, which is my out of town fave."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Foodie J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1/4/2016,5.0,Shockingly good.  Perfect burgers and a fantastic brown liquor selection.  You can't go wrong.  A must-see.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ripp K.,"NC, NC",9/2/2015,5.0,Best bison burger I have ever had.  Just sayin.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jenna W.,"Knoxville, TN",1/29/2016,2.0,"Meh. I think because this place was talked up so much, I had super high expectations. The food was good, service was good, but nothing spectacular. The atmosphere is fun for a date night but not a place for kiddos."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Adam R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/24/2016,5.0,"Well worth the wait! After 2 years I finally had a chance to eat here. We got in line at home with the No Wait app and it was a blessing since there was about a 2 hour wait. Once we finally made it to a table the fun began. My father in law and I started out with bourbon flights. I had the Tennessee and Kentucky which ran around  $16 and it was well worth it. He had the small batch flight for $20 which was also tasty. Great way to start! Now to the food....I ordered the bison burger which had mushrooms, Boursin cheese, crispy onions, garlic aioli, served with duck confit fries. Amazing! Maybe the best burger I've ever had. The fries were amazing if you don't mind a lil grease. Def get an extra garlic aioli on the side for the fries. My wife got the black bean and corn salad with chicken and she loved it. My father in law got the farm house with a fried egg and really enjoyed it. So all in all it's worth the wait! Can't wait to go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Zack G.,"Knoxville, TN",1/19/2016,5.0,"Best burgers in town.  Fantastic whiskey list.  Be sure to upgrade to the duck confit fries, they're to die for.  Be warned, on game days the waits can be quite long so take that into account when planning your meal."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bobby M.,"Golden, CO",1/17/2016,5.0,Had the gyro burger which was off the menu. It's was good. The meat was prepared medium well and it was very good and juicy. Fries were very good.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Will B.,"Champaign, IL",1/17/2016,5.0,"I still contend that this is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten in my life. I got a bison burger with some other trimmings and it was to die for. The excellent draft beer that I had along side it definitely didn't hurt, either. The wait time is typically 1+ hours but if you're willing to wait, I can almost guarantee it will be worth it. Go explore some shops in the mean time and come back with your appetite because you will need it!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Benjamin M.,"Miami, FL",1/12/2016,5.0,"Great place to stop and have a few drinks while walking on Market Square in Knoxville, TN. I was really impressed with the variety of drinks on the menu. I especially loved that they had a large selection of whiskeys to choose from. Another thing that I liked was that they also serve food. I tried one of their appetizers and was very satisfied. Great place to hang out and have a good time."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alex A.,"Knoxville, TN",1/9/2016,5.0,We use to visit Stock and Barrel quite frequently when we lived in Knox. It is outrageous! Every single item we ordered was out of this world. The beer and whiskey selection was always top notch. The burgers hit the spot every time! We will come back when in town again.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Susan P.,"Mascot, TN",1/6/2016,4.0,"I gave this place 4 stars because my husband loves it but I think it is just ok.  The duck confit fries are worth the upgrade and they give you a ton of them so you can share.  I also love the fried mushrooms but as for a burger, maybe I have just not ordered the right one yet because I was not blown away.  I got the one with the Blue Cheese on it (can't remember the name) but it had a bit of a funny taste to me - and I love blue cheese."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert B.,"Knoxville, TN",1/5/2016,4.0,"Love it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is expensive.  I was surprised when I got my bill.  It is after all, hamburgers, even though it is probably the best hamburgers I have ever had.  The Bernie is fantastic (Bernie Burger, you eat it, someone else pays for it), the Hurt Locker, wonderful.  The Confit fries are good although too salty for me.  My wife loved them.Great place for bourbon.  They must have over a hundred different bourbons.  By doing a flight (4, 1/2 shots), I was able to find a new favorite bourbon.  It was crowded, as always, plus it was New Years Eve.The service is good.  Prompt and friendly.  You get a text message on your phone when your table is ready.All in all, we had a great time."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dustin R.,"Nashville, TN",1/5/2016,5.0,"The best burgers in Knoxville. They need a bigger variety of craft beer on tap, but that is really my only complaint."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,KT S.,"Mount Juliet, TN",1/30/2016,5.0,"Favorite restaurant ever. The salmon burger with the fries is amazing. The water tastes bad so I would recommend getting a beverage. Also, get the ""No Wait"" app so that you know where you are in line because there's always a wait (because it's SO good). Stock & Barrel will have my dying meal, my favorite restaurant in Knoxville, or ever."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Larry M.,"Nacogdoches, TX",8/11/2016,4.0,"freakin incredible! the lamb burger was super tasty; the duck fries, well I could just had those for dinner. I had a Japanese bourbon on recommendation from the bartender. SMOOTH! lol It was very good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michelle J.,"Knoxville, TN",1/28/2018,5.0,"If you are a lover of the best whiskeys, juicy naughty burgers, orgasmic Duck Confit French fries and an urban ambience, this place is for you... I recommend The Billy, The Lamb and The Farmhouse Burgers.  The dessert burgers are a little much for me.  You must try the Confit French fries.  They are amazing!!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tara B.,"Nashville, TN",4/13/2016,5.0,"The turkey burger here is out of this world. So filling with plenty of fresh ingredients. It's packed with flavor. The Nutella shake is incredible as well. Even though we were out on the patio, we got excellent service. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Great experience!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kattie P.,"TN, TN",7/24/2018,5.0,Was honestly the best burger I've ever had!! My husband had the Elvis and ate ever bite... lol We went here for our Anniversary and I'm so glad we did! We'll definitely be going back soon.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mindy Y.,"Knoxville, TN",2/1/2017,5.0,The burgers are awesome and huge! The fries are onion rings compliment the sandwiches perfectly. The atmosphere finishes off the whole excellent dining experience quite well.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie C.,"Sevierville, TN",11/17/2015,4.0,"The Hurt Locker is a must try!! Delicious! Mac & cheese had somewhat of a kick to it, but overall tasty food. Only downside was there didn't appear to be any selection for younger kids"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chandler F.,"Santa Fe, NM",4/24/2016,5.0,"Come hungry, leave very full! These unique burgers are perfectly cooked and topped with amazing ingredients."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Janine A.,"Knoxville, TN",2/22/2016,5.0,Best burgers in Knoxville bar none.  The lamb burger is to die for and you can't miss the duck confit fries.  Beware the wait can be really long.  Plan to put your name in and get a drink elsewhere.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John H.,"Knoxville, TN",1/19/2017,5.0,"Exceptional burger, exceptional service. I met the owner of Mitchell Family Farm, the producer of Stock & Barrel's beef earlier in the week, so I had to check it out. This locally raised beef has great flavor and was perfectly prepared. Fries and onion rings were excellent!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Aaron D.,"Thompson's Station, TN",11/20/2015,5.0,Stopped there for lunch on the way to Nashville. One of the best burgers ever. Don't pass this up!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Asal N.,"Alexandria, VA",6/30/2016,4.0,Stoped in for a burger and beer. They have an OK selection of beers and a great selection of whiskey and bourbon.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jen J.,"Charlotte, NC",9/11/2016,4.0,Great burgers! Bloody Mary made with bourbon was interesting. Pimiento cheese app yummy.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Leopold K.,"St. Augustine, FL",3/4/2016,4.0,"Really nice burgers and of course a good selection of bourbon. Cooked to order and with the correct amount of ""done"" for the meat, which is harder than it would seem to get when eating out. Bartenders were good and very prompt throughout the evening. I'd go back if I lived here"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brianna C.,"Cohoes, NY",9/8/2016,5.0,"Best hamburger I've ever eaten!!!!! It's called the hurt locker (fried green tomato, grilled onions, pimento cheese!!) and it's incredible. Fresh cut fries were also really tasty! We made a detour for this place as we were passing thru Knoxville, and it was totally worth it!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike L.,"Atlanta, GA",12/10/2015,5.0,"Simply put, best burgers in Knoxville, and maybe the world. Staff is friendly and quick. Every side item is delicious. Two words: Hurt. Locker."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nick H.,"Knoxville, TN",5/6/2015,4.0,I absolutely love bourbon...this place has quite a selection. We love their unique burgers. Their elk burger or the bison burger at medium rare is amazingly tender and flavorful.  We also love the duck confit fries!!! OMGoodness!!!! With the Parmesan cheese on top...amazing!  Pair this with a nice Hudson Four Grain Bourbon or something of your personal liking...you will not be disappointed. Plus they do have gluten free buns and gluten free options.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Celeste H.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",5/3/2014,5.0,"Bourbon and magnificent burgers, do you need a better reason?! Go here now, and thank me later."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sophie L.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",4/1/2016,5.0,We are here tonight with my boyfriend brother and SIL. It was AMAZING. they have fries that are deep-fried then deep fried again in duck fat. SO GOOD! I can't even explain their burger  I've never had one like it!! This place is so amazing. I'm so happy Brett and Melanie brought us here!! Our server was amazing too. He had such a good attitude and was always checking in to see if we were okay! I've heard the wait time can be 2-2 1/2 hours so I would call ahead for seating.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gia S.,"Philadelphia, PA",2/6/2016,5.0,"We went here on a Friday night around 9pm and waited maybe the 45 minutes or so that they'd estimated before getting a seat. They text you when your table is ready, so you can walk around the area and grab a drink elsewhere while waiting for your table. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and our server was just the right amount of attentive. I had two orders of the side of mac and cheese that they made into a bowl for me, and a side of fries. My boyfriend enjoyed the bison burger, which is recommended by the staff as their most popular burger. We also got the Tennessee vs Kentucky flight of Bourbon, the Kentucky Bourbon beer, and the Red Hare beer. The mac and cheese was nice and cheesy and good, and I enjoyed the fries. My boyfriend enjoyed his bison burger but not as much as anticipated from people building it up and raising expectations. The duck fries weren't that great either, their fries are definitely better just plain. The Bourbon flight was really good, and we enjoyed our beers. Prices for the sides were pretty good, but for everything else it was a little high. We were pleased with our visit and will probably come back sometime down the road after trying out other places in the area. No WiFi if you're looking for that, but overall- great service, relatively high prices, good portions, and pretty good food."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tyler T.,"Knoxville, TN",12/24/2016,5.0,Its the best burger spot in town. Go there. Get the duck fat fries! Have a bourbon and a burger! Its a busy place  so be patient.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessica S.,"Bedford, IN",6/7/2016,4.0,"Banana Burger was wonderful.  A bit salty, but so good! Great place to gather with friends and enjoy a drink and some beef.  Love."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John C.,"Atlanta, GA",3/23/2016,5.0,"Best burgers in Knoxville bar none and an awesome collection of whisky.  Bar tenders and staff are always friendly.  My favorite burger is the Ring of Fire, though I have yet to find a burger they make that I do not like."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/16/2016,5.0,"Wow! This place is great. From the time we walked in the door the friendly Hostess greeted us and seeded the Two of Us in mediately. The server was a very friendly young lady who smile the entire time making us feel so comfortable at this new restaurant. The menu has mostly Burgers on it, however, they are the best burgers I've ever had. And hamburgers and one of my favorite items to eat. They have a good beer menu and wine menu. The specialty drinks are a little pricey but they are worth it. As far as parking goes, we usually park in one of the garages in downtown. And the garages to have handicap parking. The atmosphere in the restaurant was fun, you could go there from Dressy to casual. This looks like a great place for Knoxville downtown businesses to go to lunch as the prices on the menu themselves are also very reasonable and you get a lot of food."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Blaine B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/16/2016,4.0,Great burgers and fries. It's kind of pricey but worth it. The drinks could be priced more fairly. Overall a great eat. Show up early cause they get packed quickly.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brenda R.,"Clarksville, TN",7/15/2015,5.0,"I don't remember what the feta appetizer was called, but it was the most amazing thing I have ever eaten. Grilled hunk of feta drizzled with a honey sauce and wonderful delicious bread. I literally did not share with anybody in my family. They had lots of delicious dark beers, which are my favorite and the boys loved the burgers. Don't live in Knoxville but plan on being a regular every time we drive through!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jonathan G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/28/2015,4.0,The stellar food quality (mostly) makes up for the noisy atmosphere and indifferent waitstaff.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dan C.,"Knoxville, TN",11/21/2015,5.0,"Best burgers in Knoxville, no contest. The steakhouse burger is the best, but I also really like the Billy burger (hold the tomato jam, though, unless you want a really sweet burger).The fried green tomatoes here are the best. Topped with goat cheese and a balsamic reduction. So good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeff G.,"Knoxville, TN",8/28/2017,4.0,"I have been to Stock & Barrel at least 5 times now and only on my most recent visit did I finally try their food. They have one of the better whiskey selections in Knoxville and I think their pricing is at least fair for the most part. One thing that I didn't like is that on an earlier visit they had a John E Fitzgerald 20 year on the shelf with their other offerings but when I asked for a shot I was told that it wasn't for sale. Call me old fashioned but if you have a bottle situated among every other bottle that you sell by the dram, then it should too  be for sale. The burgers are good but in my opinion outside of fast food places, it is very difficult to mess up a burger. Wait has never been too long to get in here but at times there can be a lag in service whether they are busy or not. When I'm downtown and in the mood for a whiskey, S&B is one of my go to spots for something outside the same old."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Eric V.,"Knoxville, TN",10/8/2015,4.0,Good food. One of the better burgers in Knoxville. Skipped hour wait on last attempt to visit and went somewhere else.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dennis P.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",4/4/2018,5.0,"Delicious burgers. I normally dont like fries but dang theyre good here. Excellent and attentive service. You can tell this place isnt about to start slacking anytime soon. If you like gourmet burgers, just go and enjoy yourself."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,James N.,"Knox, TN",7/30/2016,4.0,"I'm a salad guy, and their salads are good....really good. I usually get he wedge+grilled chicken. Be forewarned, this place is about 30% more expensive than a chain restaurant. Only real complaints are that their seating could be more comfortable and a bit more spread out."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jacci F.,"Knoxville, TN",10/22/2017,5.0,"Where do you start?  Great burgers, homemade ketchup and tomato jam - fries done in duck fat - great service - all around an excellent choice!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessica K.,"Pigeon Forge, TN",7/16/2016,5.0,"The burgers were great.  The fries were hot, crunchy in the outside and warm in the middle.  The onion rings may have been the best in Knoxville (I'm holding out in case I haven't tried them somewhere).  The service was fast considering the +1 hour wait at 6p and +2 hour wait at 7p.  The place is LOUD, you are not going to have a detailed dinner conversation.  Overall good food, good burgers, the wait would be a deterrent for us to come back much."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Crad T.,"Loudon, TN",10/13/2018,3.0,"The food was really good, but the mac and cheese was very dry and didn't have much flavor. The bacon on my burger was the only thing you could taste. Although, the fried pickles were very good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Arnie H.,"Knoxville, TN",2/12/2017,5.0,"I have had several burgers here. They are all wonderful, but ""The Billy"", absolutely the best burger I have had in my life. Try them all. Gret job by all."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jamie M.,"Columbus, OH",5/17/2015,4.0,"Best burger joint in Knoxville. Although there is Bad Daddys and Littons, I prefer stock and barrel any day. Their selection of burgers are incredible and this location cannot be beat. Although Bad Daddys competes with the burger selection that stock and barrel provides, stock and barrel pulls through. They also have rotating special burgers, and their ingredients are what truly make the burger. They use local ingredients that all contribute to an amazing burger. From bun to bun and everything in between the ingredients cannot be beat. However, I would argue Littons has a more juicy burger, Stock and barrel reigns champion in everything else. The fries are equally as amazing as the burger and add to the experience. I have tried their milkshakes and I would say Bad Daddys wins in the milkshake category. Overall, stock and barrel is a solid choice."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/13/2015,5.0,"Man, these folks know how to do burgers right! I know I sound like a broken record, but I have not had anything less than a great experience when dining here. I go with the Farmhouse, crispy fries and the vanilla porter. Yum, just writing this review has my mouth watering in anticipation of my next visit."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/19/2015,5.0,"Absolutely the best hamburger in Knoxville!Bison, Lamb, with an egg, bacon, or tonight's special - elk. Try one, try 'em all. Great food and great service when sitting at the bar."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/13/2014,5.0,"Wow!Lamb burger and Bison burger, phenomenal!Fried 'shrooms, duck fat French fries and O-rings, awesome! Bourbon selection makes you feel like Bluegrass royalty! Can't wait to go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Robert D.,"Rutherfordton, NC",7/7/2016,4.0,Seems like a neat place. Food was good. Service could use some work. I guess it is more comfortable for hipsters.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/16/2013,2.0,"I have eaten here 6 times, although I think my last time was in September when I gave up for a spell due to inconsistent experiences. Maybe they settled the staff and cooks since then?I have had truly amazing burgers here, and I have had the same horror show as another reviewer where the burger was so pink/red inside it scared me enough to stop eating it. That time, the server didn't ask why I didn't want a box to go when I left half of it uneaten. She was so preoccupied with other things I didn't even bother to go over the problems with her, I just decided I wouldn't be back for a while. 2 out of 6 times it was amazing, 2 times were just ok, and 2 were just terrible. If I'm going to spend money out, I'd rather go somewhere I can count on consistently great experiences."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brooke W.,"Naperville, IL",6/30/2018,5.0,"In town for the night and our hotel recommended this gem!  Hands down the BEST burger ever!  I also have 3 children, 1 who is extremely picky eater and 1 who likes everything plain... they did a fantastic job accommodating their wants!  Worth the wait!  Thanks yelp for getting us on the waitlist before we even left the hotel"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Daniel T.,"Knoxville, TN",9/29/2017,5.0,"We've been here on several occasions and every time everything is amazing. The burgers are some of the best I've had. I usually end up with the diablo burger and it's Spiciness level can vary, but TS always good. The duck fries are a must. I've yet to find somewhere better. The deserts are also really good. The only downside is this place is so popular and its space is pretty small, so there is usually a decent wait time, but it has been worth it every time."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Thao T.,"Hendersonville, TN",4/23/2015,5.0,"Beautiful bar, love the decor. The burgers are REALLY good, as everyone says. GET THE DUCK FRIES. I have dreams about these fries, they're so greasy and delicious. The mac n cheese is so-so... oh well. It's always super crowded and loud whenever I go, but the food is really worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Austin K.,"Fort Worth, TX",12/14/2013,5.0,"I have eaten here 2x in the past 2 days, SOOOO GOOD! I had the Farmhouse... how it comes, yesterday and today I tried a lamb burger for the first time ""The Billy"" Style, HIGHLY Recommend, Both burgers are amazing. The place is quickly growing to become a Knoxville Favorite of many. A sweet rustic Atmosphere and simply DE-LISHIOUS FOOD, a perfect addition to the Market Square!  As far as table service I haven't experienced that, I've only sat at the bar but it has been both times fast, polite, and attentive even when busy. Multiple TV's for watching sports and super chill music, Ex James Morrison. If it's your first time to Knox or you have lived here for years I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND it especially if you enjoy unique dishes."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Angela L.,"Talbott, TN",6/18/2018,4.0,"Went their June 16, 2018. Got bacon burger with onion rings and sweet tea. Husband got cheeseburger and fries. I ordered my burger well done and the burger was done and still juicy my only complaint was their was one piece of bacon on burger and it tasted old and wasn't warm. They must have cooked earlier. The tea was wonderful and the onion rings were great. My husband enjoyed all of his meal. You get a big burger and nice size of onion rings  and French fried as well. Overall this place was great and the service was as well. We only had to wait about 5 minutes ( 3 in our party). Would have given them a 5 if it hadn't been for the bacon. We will go back again though."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lisa M.,"Mason, OH",4/2/2016,5.0,"Food and service was great!  I will always make this a must stop. We stopped for dinner on our way to the Smokies and now we have planned our return trip so that we can stop for lunch.  I had the American burger and my husband had the stake burger last time,  both were delicious.  The onion rings were great as well. The guy seated next to us ordered the fried green tomatoes and they looked awsome but beware the portion was huge. We didn't order milkshakes but people who did seemed to be very happy with them. The bourbon selection large. The place was very busy so call ahead to put your name in if you are in a hurry."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paul M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/15/2016,4.0,"We were able to squeeze in to grab a burger yesterday and glad that we did.  The wait was a bit long, but worth the wait.  Make sure you try the onion rings.  My only advice would be to add a few more tables.  It is a small place."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matt K.,"Sevierville, TN",11/26/2015,4.0,"Cool atmosphere for date night, although seating is limited if it's busy. Cool bar that had a fabulous bourbon selection. Also impressed with the small but unique draft beer selection. Bourbon prices a little high, but we tried anyway. Some rare ones available too. Crab dip appetizer was awesome. Bartender was great."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Pam C.,"Treasure Island, FL",3/26/2018,5.0,"""Best burger place around"" is what our valet attendant said when we checked in...so we headed to Market Square and were pleasantly surprised by the venue!  Great atmosphere as we sat at the bar and quick & friendly service confirmed we made a great choice.  The place was busy but we received our burgers rather quickly.  Huge, hot and delicious!  The onion rings were amazing and the fries were great too.  We would highly recommend this place to everyone visiting Knoxville."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kirsten H.,"San Marcos, CA",7/16/2015,2.0,Really disappointed in this restaurant. I'm only giving it two stars because the service was absolutely terrible and the food when finally received was average at best.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Miranda H.,"Middlesboro, KY",9/15/2018,4.0,I got the chicken sandwich (I believe it's called the mother clucker) and my boyfriend got the steakhouse burger. While I felt like mine was the best chicken sandwich I'd ever had he was less than impressed with his burger. He said it was way overhyped in his opinion. I would definitely eat here again he might just take a little convincing.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cambron W.,"Durham, NC",5/19/2018,4.0,"My wife and I had a great time here. Burgers were delicious, good beer selection, really friendly service, plus we got to sit outdoors. Great view of all the people on market square! I would definitely go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jennifer R.,"Asheville, NC",12/18/2016,5.0,"Best burger (of any kind salmon, feta etc.) in Knoxville. A bit pricy...but you get what you pay for!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joshua H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/1/2015,4.0,"I ate here at the recommendation of a friend. The burgers are tasty with a little Southern flare. If you like whisky and bourbon they have a great selection. The service, for me, was perfect. They checked on you every 10 minutes or so but weren't intrusive. When asked which food the server/bartender liked they didn't give a panned ""everything is great!"" They provided their personal recommendations and indicated which items were customer favorites. It was busy but not overly loud or distracting."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Simon B.,"Knoxville, TN",2/2/2015,5.0,"Stock and Barrel has become my benchmark for a good burger.  It doesn't hurt that they have hands down the best Bourbon selection in town either.  I am someone who almost never eats the specials or even listens when they are read; that changed here.  Their buffalo burger is to die for as is there Chicken and Waffles. The only downside to this place is how small it is and so you have to plan ahead for a wait or to get their early.  However, this is offset by them using the NoWait app.  You can get into line before you even leave your house and they will text you when your table is ready."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sharon T.,"Rolesville, NC",9/12/2014,5.0,"My husband and I are in Knoxville for a convention and I was looking for something to do and places to eat. I read about Market Square and read the restaurant reviews on Yelp!  As always, reviews are subject to so many factors so I concentrated on those places with more ""good"" reviews and selected Stock & Barrel.  The meat and vegetables are locally sourced.  All the meat is grass fed and hormone free.   I know good food and I can tell you - our experience was absolutely one that all foodies would appreciate.  We were promptly seated (we arrived at 1:00 pm) and drink orders taken.  Our server checked back within minutes to take our order.  I ordered ""The Billy""  - beef patty, tomato jam, goat cheese, bacon and bourbon onions.   The meat was perfectly cooked - I ordered it medium, the bun was fresh but had a thin, crisp, outer layer i.e., not soggy.  I also had the tomato salad which was fresh and delicious.  My husband had the bison burger loaded with mushrooms and onions and he said it was one of the best he's had and it was cooked perfectly.  We shared an order of duck confit fries and oh my, oh my!  Pure, unadulterated, deliciousness.  They are fried in duck fat and have a flavor you're sure not to find elsewhere anytime soon - if ever.  Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu and food preparations.  She provided the right amount of service and did not suffocate us or ignore us.  My only regret is I didn't try any of the numerous bourbon's on the drink menu or the s'more shake - bit wait, we're going back for lunch before we leave town - yea, I can't wait.If you love burgers and fries with interesting combinations and cooked to perfection, Stock & Barrel is for you (they have other menu items as well).   My only other recommendation is not to go during peak lunch or dinner service as it isn't particularly large and you may have to wait to be seated but if that happens take it in stride as you will be rewarded with a delicious meal."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dustin R.,"Nashville, TN",1/5/2016,5.0,"The best burgers in Knoxville. They need a bigger variety of craft beer on tap, but that is really my only complaint."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amelia L.,"Knoxville, TN",9/5/2016,3.0,"They are always busy and have a wait, but when I finally got in, I felt it was a little overrated. The burgers are good but I've had better (like at 5 on Gay Street) and the fries were just fries. I probably won't come back unless I get out voted by my friends - there's better food elsewhere on Market Square."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Josh J.,"La Jolla, CA",6/24/2015,5.0,"Passing through on my way to California. One of the best burgers I've had. Selection of bourbon is outstanding the and the pricing is extremely fair for the quality of food, beverage and service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Curt H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2015,4.0,"If you want a burger and a glass off small batch, single barrel, or even a malted whiskey this is the place for you. Hand cut french fries seasoned with sea salt and cracked pepper, homemade buns, grade A beef and a baked mac-n-cheese that makes you wonder what you been eating for the last decade. Two enthusiasts thumbs up. The only reason I'm giving a 4 star is becaus some of the pours are a little stingy for what you pay, you pay premium and get mediocre otherwise 5 stars all the way. I suggest the Bowen single barrel for you bourbon lovers :-)"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael F.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2015,3.0,"I went about a month ago and was not overly impressed. The burger was good, but did not live up to the hype. I have had much better burgers in Knoxville!Another reason I didn't enjoy my experience was the atmosphere. The seats are a cheap, metal-like material. You also are crammed into a very narrow space. I felt like I was eating with the groups to my left and right. On the positive side, the service was great. The waiter was very attentive even on a busy night."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael M.,"East Berlin, CT",4/19/2015,5.0,The duck Condit fries are without any doubt in my mind the best fries I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Absolutely wonderful food and attentive services makes this place easily a 5. Trust the servers burger recommendation. You won't be disappointed.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tara E.,"North Palm Beach, FL",7/7/2015,5.0,"Fantastic and delicious dining experience!  We had the wedge salad and Steakhouse Burger - both were amazing. We opted for the onion rings over the fries, which were non-greasy and crispy. The kids had a S'mores shake.  This was a lot of bang for the buck in a hip trendy bar/restaurant."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Diana D.,"Lakeland, FL",4/17/2018,2.0,"Pretty disappointed as I had high expectations from reviews read.  Burger wasn't anything spectacular, fries either alone or with parmesan etc all tasted the same. Dissapointing :("
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amy K.,"Knoxville, TN",6/9/2015,4.0,"Amazingly diverse burger selection!!  And the reviews about the duck fat fries don't lie!!  Good service, wait staff was very engaging and knowledgeable about the food.  Efficient and friendly.  A bit pricey for the burger but worth it in size and creativity!  Only complaint is seating, which is limited but normal size for a Market Square restaurant."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Meena H.,"Tallahassee, FL",12/28/2016,1.0,"Service was terrible. We were told 20 to 30 minute wait for a party of 10. We provided a cell phone number for the waitress to contact us.   Downloaded the app which told us where we are in line. After 30 minutes, we reached first in line according to the app, but got no notification from the hostess. We were standing directly outside. Went inside to check and saw a party of 8 that had come in after us,  being seated at a table for 10. The hostess kept telling us to wait. She had us on her list. She seemed totally overwhelmed. After an hour and 20 minutes we gave up and left. Lunch hour had wound down. Saw lots of people leaving, but still we were not seated. What poor management. Will never go there again and will make sure this gets on every relevant blog possible including the Airbnb sites."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kate H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/7/2015,5.0,"Best burger in town!  Great atmosphere and courteous wait staff make it a perfect place to bring out of towners, the family, or a date night."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jacquie C.,"Naples, FL",6/6/2015,5.0,"Friday night wait time was 2 hours. We had some drinks at local bars and held out the wait. Well worth it. Burgers are the only way to go. Apps were good, drinks were good, dessert was awesome. Prices were reasonable, service attentive. Definitely recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jay Z.,"TN, TN",7/27/2017,5.0,"Favorite place in Knoxville to eat!!  Incredible burgers, great duck fat fries, and love the atmosphere.  The Bernie is a great choice for burgers."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jayme A.,"Knoxville, TN",1/21/2015,4.0,"Not too shabby. Small place, crowded, always busy, but great food. It is definitely worth the wait, if you come in during a busy time. Like others have reviewed you HAVE to get a burger, they are mouth watering. Two thumbs up from this guy"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rebekah T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/27/2015,5.0,"I absolutely adore Stock and Barrel and have always had a positive experience (so much so that we tried to plan and after-wedding lunch here with my wedding party in May- but alas, they do not take reservations. I was heartbroken.)  Great atmosphere, delicious food. If you like a little spice try the Ring of Fire. This is my favorite burger place in Knoxville, hands down."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sean G.,"Shelbyville, IN",3/29/2018,5.0,"Delightful local establishment with all the bourbon you could hope to imagine.  Burgers are original and, for the most part, scrummy.   It was a long wait, but I left feeling glad of our patience."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bryan M.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2015,4.0,"The place was very crowded when we went (it was a Saturday), but the wait didn't seem that long because there was a band playing in Market Square.  They actually have a pretty good beer menu, and the food was great!  I would recommend getting the Spicy Crab Dip as an appetizer, but get two because you won't want to share!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alyssa G.,"Chicago, IL",7/18/2018,5.0,"This place is fantastic!  At the recommendation of our waitress, Brooke, we tried The Hurt Locker Burger...  It was FANTASTIC!!  Everything is locally sourced, great environment, super cute downtown area, and probably the best onion rings ever!  If you are looking for drinks and appetizers, they have a full bar, extensive beer menu, and tons of appetizers as well. I used Yelp to reserve my place in line, and waited only 10 minutes...  Bonus!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashley G.,"Hartford, CT",12/30/2015,5.0,"Amazing food, great service, and really awesome atmosphere. We stopped on our way from Charlotte to Nashville and we were really impressed. I ordered the wedge salad and the Mac and cheese and my boyfriend ordered the farmhouse burger. They also have a great selection of whiskey even though we didn't try any."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joshua W.,"Chicago, IL",4/30/2015,5.0,"Very good! Easily the best restaurant I tried while I was in Knoxville. Make sure you make a reservation beforehand because they get very busy. If you can't get a table right away, you can always just hit up one of the bars in Market Square while you're waiting. That's what I did. Well worth the wait!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jordan H.,"Knoxville, TN",3/7/2018,3.0,"Stock & Barrel was good. Good service! Quality burgers, fries were okay. Not as crispy or seasoned as I would have liked. I do like the atmosphere of Market Square, and being able to sit outside and eat with your dog when the weather is nice! It is somewhere I might be willing to go to again, but not a staple for me."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Beau L.,"St. Petersburg, FL",9/2/2015,5.0,"Delicious! My cousin took me here and it was the highlight of my trip! Best burgers ever, and great atmosphere."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shannon F.,"Knoxville, TN",12/16/2015,5.0,Obviously the burgers are great but hands down the best onion rings I have ever had anywhere!! Fun atmosphere and hyper-local eats. Definitely worth the trip!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lauren S.,"Mesa, AZ",10/28/2017,5.0,"These were the best burgers! We got the black and blue burger and the Bernie. Both were delicious. Order a side of tomato jam for them, you won't regret it! The fries were crispy and flavorful. We also got the pimento cheese appetizer, which was also good. My husband had a couple different bourbons and beers; he said all was smooth and delicious. Our bartender was knowledgeable and friendly. Nothing was bad about this place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Curtis W.,"Columbus, OH",6/30/2018,5.0,"My buddy Anthony is at BEST in different to ever place he's ever ate. And he's on the road ever week, usually being a grump at every local establishment Nation wide. He ate here and said it's the single best place he's ate, Michelin star competition included. He asked for the owner to express his gratitude. I've never ate here, but if Anthony thinks this highly of it, it's a must try!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Julian A.,"Knoxville, TN",6/28/2016,5.0,"The stock and barrel is amazing , the food is great . It comes out fast and there is also amazing shakes ."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kevin L.,"Westbury, NY",3/29/2015,5.0,"Just get the Elvis. Who knew peanut butter, banana and beef would work so well together"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ryan W.,"Fishers, IN",3/22/2015,2.0,"Enjoyed the environment and the drinks more than the food. The fries that are cooked in duck juice/cream/blood/whatever were okay. Personally thought the onion rings were better. All that said, would I go back? Nah! I'd be inclined to try something else unique in the area."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather D.,"Seattle, WA",4/11/2015,5.0,"Great service, burgers, shakes and fries. Plus, they have a HUGE whiskey selection... and i love me some whiskey."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Amy G.,"Knoxville, TN",2/14/2016,5.0,1st time visit for us and we were looking for a real burger not these wannabes from McD's. Bacon cheeseburger + confit fries are to.die.for.  Total fat girl oblivion achieved.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Beth T.,"Crystal Lake, IL",6/17/2016,4.0,"That meal was delicious.  They need to put out an official kids menu, they have one but not on paper.  The burgers were delicious, go for a flight if you can't pick a bourbon and don't ignore the chicken sandwiches."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Miranda P.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",6/6/2015,5.0,"Management here is really amazing, and is very inclined to make sure you have a wonderful experience!! I can back after a really bad experience and will say it must have been a one time thing because this time it was really amazing. Great service, great burger. I will be back! The farm burger is amazing!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Miranda P.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",4/25/2015,3.0,"Management here is really amazing, and is very inclined to make sure you have a wonderful experience!! The fries are really good also. Will be giving this place another try"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Miranda P.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",4/23/2015,2.0,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this place. My drink had paper and other things in it... I don't know if something just fell in it or if was just dirty... Even with that I was super excited for the burger, which me and my boyfriend ordered medium. His came out done charred on the sides and mine was well well done and the buns were really hard. :(( so sad to be disappointed by this place."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel N.,"Flower Mound, TX",6/12/2018,5.0,Food was fantastic as was the location and the wait staff! Couldn't have been happier with our choice driving through. Burgers were juicy and the Onion rings were the best I've ever had.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Phil K.,"Knoxville, TN",5/28/2015,5.0,Great burgers. Great drink selection. Bar can be slow but who cares it's worth it. They have a bison burger that is the best around these parts. And I can't NOT get the duck confit fries whenever we go. They are so so good. The serving is enough to share if you're that kind of person.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Hunter M.,"Washington, DC",12/29/2014,3.0,I've given Stock & Barrel two shots now and I'm just not impressed.  It's a decent burger but I've certainly had much better.  They often times feel too complicated or like there are two many different tastes thrown between two buns.  I've also never been able to get one that's not been overcooked.  Maybe they are just concerned about undercooked meat but if I ask for it medium to medium-rare I want to see pink.  Both milkshakes I've had went unfinished and just weren't that good.  It seems like Stock & Barrel is winning people over by piling different and new ingredients on burgers but not really giving much consideration to how those burgers taste.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,David B.,"Knoxville, TN",3/25/2015,5.0,"Awesome place! Best whiskey selection hand down. Great burger too. The only problem is the location. If you can put up with loud mouthed college kids who can't hold their liquor, it is well worth the trip. I would highly recommend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jennie A.,"Knoxville, TN",4/6/2015,5.0,"I cannot say enough good things about Stock and Barrel. I've been several times and one of the most impressive things about S&B is the consistency... in most every category, including great and friendly service, rad decor and ambiance, delicious food and my favorite cocktail in Knoxville (the Nor'reaster - made with Maker's Mark and Ginger beer).  The burgers are wonderful.  I've been through quite a few menu items and the Billy stands out - topped with a healthy amount of Goat Cheese, Tomato Jam, grilled onions and Bacon.  There is nothing else quite like it in Knoxville.  The absolute winner, though, are the duck confit fries.  Try them.  You won't be sad. The only complaint is that the rest of Knoxville quickly discovered how awesome this place is and getting in the door on the weekends is quite a challenge."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Anna G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7/2/2015,5.0,"It might be hard to get a table here sometimes but the wait is always worth it. The first time I ever visited, I decided to get the duck confit fries and it was the best decision I could have made. They are arguably the best item on the entire menu. Make sure you try them when you go! I also had the Free Bird burger because I'm a fan of turkey burgers and it did not disappoint. One thing I wish I would have tried is their milkshakes, but I guess it's always good to leave something for next time."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Anne W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/25/2016,5.0,Great gluten-free buns for their incredible burgers!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Garrett P.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",1/21/2018,5.0,Best burger I've ever eaten. I got the Hurt Locker. Locally sourced beef and bacon was full of flavor. Bun was made by local bakery and was delicious. Fries were top notch too. Highly recommend. Get on the waiting list thru Yelp. Not a huge place and getting on the waiting list minimized wait time.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jennifer G.,"Cincinnati, OH",11/8/2017,5.0,"A small venue, but it's completely worth any and all waits. Incredible burgers with great variety in toppings, all of them fresh and tasty. Even the black bean burger is amazing. Best onion rings I've ever had. Knoxville has a huge variety of places and this one is worth visiting."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian G.,"Milford, VA",3/15/2015,4.0,Best burgers I have found in town.  Try the duck fries if you like them crispy. They also offer gluten free buns.  Generally crowded with limited seating.  Best chance is to go a couple.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany T.,"Corryton, TN",5/24/2016,5.0,"I've been to this place time after time after time and I never get disappointed. The drinks are delicious, the appetizers are on point, and the burgers are top notch with a fantastic selection. I don't eat pork or beef, so the Elk burger they have is always my choice. Everything is fresh and delicious. Normally there is always a wait, but it is definitely worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Manuel S.,"San Dimas, CA",9/16/2017,5.0,The veggie burger was beyond delicious. I put it in the ring of Fire and it was great. Definitely gonna come back many more times
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Suzanne F.,"Columbus, OH",6/15/2015,3.0,Ok so thankful for yelp when I'm traveling because I can look up really cool non chain restaurants to visit. This was one of those whilst we were going through Knoxville. All I can say is fellow yelpers there were soooo many places I wanted to try here at Market Square in the heart of Knoxville. Totally reminded me of our beloved Shory North. Now onto my review.  After yelping places to try we decided on this place because of the reviews and if you're at almost five stars after 181 reviews I'm guessing you got your crap together. So me and my brood of eight go and get seated immediately because we came at an off time.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us some great suggestions but she never once told me her name. I got the bison burger with duck confit fries. We also got the fried green tomatoes because after all I'm in the South and they are gonna be the best I ever had. Um that's a nooooo on the tomatoes as I really couldn't appreciate the combo of goat cheese and balsamic dressing.  As a matter of fact my taste buds were not happy at all. I'm saying it's probably me but I was expecting wow after all those reviews. Now onto my burger we'll take know I love my Bareburger in Cbus so ya know I'm gonna compare.  Um yup it was good but sure didn't rate as high as the one I ate at Bareburger. The best thing I had was the duck confit fries. They are fried in duck fat and dressed with Parmesan cheese and green onions yummy!  Anyhow I think I'll stop here again some time to see if I can up the rating because honestly the decor and ambiance are top notch and if you like bourbon this is def your place to go to.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Charley S.,"Powell, TN",3/27/2015,4.0,Excellent variety of burgers. Cool atmosphere. Roll your sleeves up to eat these burgers. And ask for extra napkins ...
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Susan P.,"Mascot, TN",1/6/2016,4.0,"I gave this place 4 stars because my husband loves it but I think it is just ok.  The duck confit fries are worth the upgrade and they give you a ton of them so you can share.  I also love the fried mushrooms but as for a burger, maybe I have just not ordered the right one yet because I was not blown away.  I got the one with the Blue Cheese on it (can't remember the name) but it had a bit of a funny taste to me - and I love blue cheese."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Evelyn Z.,"Franklin, TN",5/10/2014,5.0,Absolutely amazing dinner. The burgers are so fresh and the fries and onion rings are incredible. All of the food tastes like It was picked that day. I highly recommend.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tammy S.,"Yulee, FL",9/5/2015,3.0,"We had the Greek burger, on special...too weird for my taste. Also the hurt locker.  I can't pinpoint what it was but, just not as good as the menu description sounded. This place was good but, just good....not the wow I'd hoped for."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kathy H.,"Smyrna, GA",2/1/2015,5.0,"Excellent meal, sitting at the bar being served by Ben. What a great bartender and server. Top customer service. We ended up at this restaurant due places closed to Super Bowl. Who would have known. We split a American Burger. Excellent! Fries good and fresh. Milk shake for dessert, s'mores and one Nutella. Both really good but liked the S'mores best. Beer selection decent not great. Thank for such a good meal. We will be back. Thanks Ben!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Aaron H.,"Pigeon Forge, TN",10/6/2014,4.0,"Love the atmosphere... Great burgers... I had the HurtLocker, which was amazing.  The burger had pimento cheese and a fried green tomato on it.... Delicious... It's hard to accommodate a large group but for small parties it is well worth it... Great place. No complaints from any of the large party I was with..."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stacey L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/8/2015,4.0,"The food here is DELICIOUS!  That being said, the wait is obscene and the seating is less than comfy.  Atmosphere can be dark, too, but again, it is all about the food!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rene P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1/1/2016,5.0,Amazing burgers. I went with the hurt locker and the duck fries. The fried pickles are not incredible.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,James S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/4/2016,2.0,"Charged extra for specialty fries that were soggy and cold, the mac and cheese was really gross and carelessly made, My burger was seriously over cooked and had no flavor. My snarky waitress was dismissive and unfriendly. I had heard so many good things but everything about this restaurant was lazy and careless."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Makayla R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/8/2015,5.0,"The most amazing burger and fries I've ever had! I got the bison burger cooked medium, and when I say it was the best, it was the BEST! My fiancé orders their Elvis burger and he is also a huge fan. Hes never found a true Elvis burger before Stock and Barrel. The beer selection is nice, they have a hard cider which is what I look for and they even offer wine, but this is the place to go for whiskey! It took up the whole back page of the drink menu. The venue isn't huge but you don't need the space for the food to taste great. Market square is already nice to sit outside anyway. Plus around 3pm the outside seating is perfectly shaded. The best burger I've ever had, and I'm not a burger person!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tara E.,"North Palm Beach, FL",7/7/2015,5.0,"Fantastic and delicious dining experience!  We had the wedge salad and Steakhouse Burger - both were amazing. We opted for the onion rings over the fries, which were non-greasy and crispy. The kids had a S'mores shake.  This was a lot of bang for the buck in a hip trendy bar/restaurant."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joshua C.,"Powell, TN",7/6/2015,5.0,I have lived in Knoxville most of my life and this is easily the best burger in Knoxville. Everything there is good but their burgers are on point. I would suggest one but it's literally all good.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kc B.,"Barstow, CA",7/5/2015,5.0,"Awesome food!My husband and I were passing through on a road trip and decided to stop. He got the burger with peanut butter and fried banana, added their blueberry jam- I tried it- amazing!I had the mother clucker and switched out the ha arts for goat cheese, delicious and awesome fries.They do have gluten free buns, but they were out at this time.Definitely a must go. It is a small place, just a heads up."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Taylor B.,"Antioch, TN",7/5/2015,5.0,Delicious burgers.  I got the 'merican burger.  I ordered it medium rare and with extra salt and that is how they made it.  The dipping sauce they served with the fries was tasty.  Reminded me of thousand island or comeback sauce.  Pimento cheese app was also very good.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tara G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/4/2015,4.0,The food is five stars. I've tried 6 different burgers here and loved them all. The pimento cheese dip is the best I've had in Knoxville and the duck confit fries we had today are equally amazing. The food is so good I've never even tried a milkshake here. I always vow at the beginning of the meal to try one but then I'm so full with great burgers that I never order the milkshake but they sound delicious. Service is way better than when they first opened. Now they are probably one of the better waitstaffs in Knoxville. I do have to take one star off for the fact that the bench seating is very uncomfortable. Service is slow but worth it. They need a larger space and better seating to get that fifth star!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tara G.,"Knoxville, TN",1/24/2015,4.0,"We came here last year and the food was good but our server was horrible. We knew it was just that one server and came back with friends tonight. Our server tonight was Hunter and he was superb, good attitude, attentive, made lots of small talk. We did have a long wait to sit and food did take awhile so I definitely recommend coming with a good conversationalist. But in the end all worth it. Everyone loved their burgers and apps (pimento cheese was very tasty!) and we all loved our Bourbon Fizzes. Glad tonight's experience was a total redemption of our first visit!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Anna G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7/2/2015,5.0,"It might be hard to get a table here sometimes but the wait is always worth it.

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jonathan G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/28/2015,4.0,The stellar food quality (mostly) makes up for the noisy atmosphere and indifferent waitstaff.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,R B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/28/2015,5.0,I'm a big fan. The buorbon selection is great. The burgers are incredible.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nathan R.,"Kingston, TN",6/24/2015,5.0,"A very small place but its packed with flavor, in fact it's the best place to not only get a burger but to sample some fine whiskey and bourbon. Highly recommended is the buffalo burger and the fried that are cooked in duck fat. You think you have had French fries before? Nope! Not till you try these fries! Also if you have the cash sit down for dinner and grab yourself some whiskey with your dinner. Worth the trip downtown for sure!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Josh J.,"La Jolla, CA",6/24/2015,5.0,"Passing through on my way to California. One of the best burgers I've had. Selection of bourbon is outstanding the and the pricing is extremely fair for the quality of food, beverage and service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelsey P.,"Savannah, GA",6/22/2015,3.0,"Not quite sure what the hype is about... food wasn't mind-blowingly delicious, or even remarkable. I had the chicken and waffle sandwich, which was pretty good and my boyfriend had the spicy (whatever) burger, which i wouldn't order again. What saved this place was its whiskey selection, tons of options, BUT the prices could be better. All in all it was a nice lunch but not a place Id recommended or want to go back to."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John D.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2015,5.0,"Food - delicious! Started with the fried green tomato appetizer and it was amazeballs. Perfectly crispy with a balsamic glaze and goat cheese crumble. Then had the bison burger with duck confiet fries...shamalamadingdong, it was delicious!!!Drink - solid beer selection. Do you also like bourbon? Good, they have a bajillion to choose from. Bottomine, get here!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2015,2.0,"First of all, I am a burger fiend. I never turn away a great cheeseburger. So, I was so excited to get to try this place when they first opened. 1. The wait is insane. If you are planning to go on a weekend night, you might as well get there at 4:00 or 5:00 so you can actually eat at ""dinner time."" They don't take reservations or call aheads either. 2. Why is it hot as hades in this place? Both times I have been, it was during the summer, so I understand it's hot. However, when its 95 degrees outside and practically 80 in the restaurant, it makes eating hot food somewhat miserable. 3. I just don't get the hype. The menu is large and they are definitely creative with their burgers, but for me, it's always just been ""meh."" I have had a multitude of burgers in my life in and out of Knoxville and wouldn't even put this on my list of best burgers. I expected some amazing beef, but felt it didn't have that much flavor. It's great they use local products and the atmosphere is cool, kinda hipster, but I just can't get into it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",6/20/2015,4.0,Also: the Bernie when available and the Kentucky bourbon barrel ale really top off those duck fries. I always go for the fries.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",7/14/2014,5.0,"MAKE SURE YOU GET THE DUCK CONFIT FRIES!  You can get them as a side with your burger for a 2.50 upcharge.  (Totally worth it!)  Please don't visit knoxville without eating here. And if you're a local and haven't been, GO TONIGHT.  So delicious.  I haven't met a burger I didn't like here but I especially enjoy the elk, steakhouse, and mother clucker.  I also enjoy the wedge salad when I'm not in the mood for a burger.  The seared tuna burger is AMAZING when available."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matthew A.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2015,5.0,"Excellent whiskies, burgers and service. My wife and I have been here several times (ok we happened to watch American Pharoah finish the triple crown while we were there). In addition, they have a great tomato salad, and our bartender was really fun and patient."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mary B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2015,4.0,"One of the best burgers in Knoxville-- well, really in the world."

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelly G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/12/2015,5.0,"Oh...my...goodness, so if you've never eaten at Stock & Barrel then this is a MUST for anyone in the Knoxville area! The elk burger was the juiciest, most savory burger I have ever put in my mouth, and the whiskey is the best palette cleanser you can find in Market Square :-)  Go check it out for yourself!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christa O.,"Knoxville, TN",10/30/2015,5.0,Call ahead for waiting list. Make sure you try the Hurt Locker burger but share with a friend!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Uni P.,"Knoxville, TN",5/27/2017,5.0,"For Knoxville and a lot of places, definitely a 5 star burger. First of its kind in Knoxville. The duck fat fries are a bit to heavy for me when couple with a burger but the burgers are delish."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Val C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/15/2016,5.0,We stopped here for the smore shake and it was just as beautiful as the picture! We'll be back without kids and dog next time lol
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brian S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/30/2015,5.0,Bartender very helpful in evaluating the many burger options on their menu. I went with the Hurt Locker and a Lagunitas Little Sumpin'. Awesome burger!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Randy d.,"Reston, VA",1/13/2015,5.0,"Stopped in before a Vols game.  Service was very good. Waitress was attentive but not overbearing. The burgers were EXCELLENT!  I had the ""Farmhouse"" burger with the fried egg cooked hard. Both the egg and the burger came out exactly as ordered.  I chose the onion rings as my side and they were awesome -- lightly battered and crazy fresh/made to order.  We had the fried pickle appetizer as well and they were great. Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert after these burgers but I'm sure it would have been great.  The night we were on the Square, the only restaurant that had them lined up at the door was the Stock & Barrel.  That tells 'ya something."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jacob A.,"Brentwood, TN",6/9/2015,5.0,"ABSOLUTELY one of the best burgers my dad and I had ever eaten. The buns are perfect, the toppings are all fresh, and the service was phenomenal. The only issue was the time to get my food out was longer than expected. I attribute that to my order of the Elk burger (on item that wasn't on the menu that particular day but can be asked for if they have the meat). Overall a great experience and have already recommended it to many other people. I look forward to eating there again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ben C.,"Denver, CO",4/22/2015,5.0,Unreal burgers and a booze list that will blow your mind. I ordered the elk burger and had the craft bourbon flight. A pricey meal but the best I've had in ages.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jess F.,"Vancouver, Canada",7/22/2015,5.0,These are literally the best burgers I've ever had in my entire life. The buns are also sooo gooood. Been there twice on my travels to Knox. Fries are delicious too. Love that they have whisky flights.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Donna B.,"Dagsboro, DE",10/2/2017,5.0,Excellent!! Had the black and blue burger with duck fries. The beef was so tasty with a very fresh bakery bun. The bacon was not the typical. It was clearly locally sourced. Freshly made blue cheese fondue on top. Scrumptious !! Also had the cheddar pimento cheese dip. Great spice with a very flavorful jam on top. All was attractively served by very friendly staff! Can't wait to go back!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Audrey C.,"Knoxville, TN",10/17/2014,5.0,"The black and bleu burger is my favorite burger in Knoxville. I've also had the heirloom tomato, cucumber and feta salad and it was fabulous. The peanut butter pie is wonderful but SO FILLING I would actually recommend it as an entree for the vegetarians of the world. Even their fries are worth the calories. The portion sizes are pretty huge but the prices are good. I recommend splitting an entree with a friend for maximum satisfaction. The staff is great, I have no complaints. The bourbon shots are boring (because it's just whiskey, duh) but they make do a good manhattan."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kaitlyn P.,"Nashville, TN",4/12/2015,5.0,"I've never tried anything that I didn't absolutely love. From the Farmhouse to the Elvis, you can't go wrong! oh, and the duck fries are a must try."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jenna W.,"Knoxville, TN",1/29/2016,2.0,"Meh. I think because this place was talked up so much, I had super high expectations. The food was good, service was good, but nothing spectacular. The atmosphere is fun for a date night but not a place for kiddos."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christopher M.,"Newton, NJ",9/19/2017,4.0,"Best burger I've had in a while. Friendly service, not terribly fast, but understandable as they were very busy. I would give it five stars but our table wasn't cleaned properly and was very sticky."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jay S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/19/2016,4.0,GREAT food and atmosphere! Excellent bourbon selection and house cocktails!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Will B.,"Champaign, IL",1/17/2016,5.0,"I still contend that this is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten in my life. I got a bison burger with some other trimmings and it was to die for. The excellent draft beer that I had along side it definitely didn't hurt, either. The wait time is typically 1+ hours but if you're willing to wait, I can almost guarantee it will be worth it. Go explore some shops in the mean time and come back with your appetite because you will need it!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Helen P.,"Knoxville, TN",1/15/2018,5.0,Honestly was not a big fan of burgers before trying this place out! It was really good and the service was great.  I would recommend it to any friend making a trip to Knoxville.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alex A.,"Knoxville, TN",1/9/2016,5.0,We use to visit Stock and Barrel quite frequently when we lived in Knox. It is outrageous! Every single item we ordered was out of this world. The beer and whiskey selection was always top notch. The burgers hit the spot every time! We will come back when in town again.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brittany C.,"New Tazewell, TN",8/23/2014,2.0,"Summary: hand patted meat with no seasoning, cooked inconsistently and served on a soggy bun. Accompanied by greasy fries and onion rings. Mediocre service. I would've given them one star but my bourbon was good and the duck confit fries were ok. Will NOT go back, especially at an average wait of an hour and a $40 check for subpar burgers. We have been so excited to eat at stock and barrel since it opened but after eating there tonight, I'm sorry to say we'll never be back. On numerous occasions, we've stopped in to see what the wait was and it's always been at least an hour and the bar was packed so we decided to go elsewhere. Tonight, we were prepared to wait an hour but there were 2 seats at the bar so we snagged those. I ordered a bourbon and the husband ordered a sweet tea but was served unsweet. We placed our food order with the bar tender who didn't write it down, which was where this disaster meal started going off course. I had the classic bacon burger with onion rings and he ordered the blue cheese burger with the duck confit fries. When we realized he hadn't asked us how we wanted our burgers cooked, we flagged him down and he said the standard is medium. Our food didn't take long to arrive, but we were sorely disappointed with it all. I had ordered no pickles because I'm not a fan of sweet pickles, but low and behold the waiter, who thought he could remember everything hadn't rang it in the way I ordered it. So I began by picking off the sweet pickles and noticed how soggy my bottom bun was. After the first few bites, I went looking for the aged cheddar cheese that was supposed to be on there. I couldn't taste it at all, but there was a thin piece of cheese melted over the burger.  My burger was bright red in some spots (med rare at best) and pink in others and continued to fall apart as I made my way through it. The onion rings left a puddle of grease on the paper they were on. My husband's burger was cooked medium well with no taste of blue cheese...maybe because the server, who again failed miserably to ring in our order from memory, gave him a steakhouse burger. He said it was a blue cheese burger but we're still not sure what he got. The meat did appear to be hand patted and fresh but was not seasoned at all. His duck confit fries were ok but also very greasy. We should've complained but were never even asked how our meal was or how everything tasted. I wanted to like stock and barrel so much, but it does not merit all the positive reviews and is certainly FAR from the best burger in Knoxville. OVERRATED. We will not be back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kara I.,"Louisville, TN",1/2/2016,4.0,Great burger joint!  I ate the hurt locker which was delicious!  The pimento cheese and fried green tomato were perfect compliments to the burger.  Everyone in our party enjoyed their burgers and beer.  We sat at the bar and received stellar service from Al.  He made the whole experience fun!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Krista G.,"Kodak, TN",1/1/2016,5.0,"Best burgers around! Hurt locker is amazing (has home made pimento cheese.!) *this place is TINY* expect to sit very close to strangers. *not kid friendly due to size,no kid menu* don't even try to take a stroller in!!!Other than that, just want to add, they have the best goat cheese ever. I don't like it normally, but theirs is on point."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nick H.,"Knoxville, TN",5/6/2015,4.0,I absolutely love bourbon...this place has quite a selection. We love their unique burgers. Their elk burger or the bison burger at medium rare is amazingly tender and flavorful.  We also love the duck confit fries!!! OMGoodness!!!! With the Parmesan cheese on top...amazing!  Pair this with a nice Hudson Four Grain Bourbon or something of your personal liking...you will not be disappointed. Plus they do have gluten free buns and gluten free options.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joshua W.,"Chicago, IL",4/30/2015,5.0,"Very good! Easily the best restaurant I tried while I was in Knoxville. Make sure you make a reservation beforehand because they get very busy. If you can't get a table right away, you can always just hit up one of the bars in Market Square while you're waiting. That's what I did. Well worth the wait!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/25/2015,5.0,"Stock & Barrel is the go-to place in Knoxville for great burgers.  When people come in from out of town we usually take them to Stock & Barrel and to see Market Square, and when they come back to visit they always want to go again.  If you're a bourbon lover, this is also the place for you as they have a huge selection. A few tips - you have to try the Duck Confit fries.  They are wonderful and not something you can get just anywhere.  They come in a big portion with your burger though - so often one of us will get the duck fries and another the onion rings because they are amazing as well.If you like fried eggs, definitely go for the Farm House.  I also love the Black & Bleu or anything with the Garlic Aioli.One last tip - there is usually a wait but now they are on an app that can get you in line ahead of time called NoWait.  We normally put our names in on the app when we leave the house and then can go right in when we get there.  You can also put your name in once you arrive and then walk around Market Square - they will text you when your table is ready so that gives you the freedom to go wherever."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Thao T.,"Hendersonville, TN",4/23/2015,5.0,"Beautiful bar, love the decor. The burgers are REALLY good, as everyone says. GET THE DUCK FRIES. I have dreams about these fries, they're so greasy and delicious. The mac n cheese is so-so... oh well. It's always super crowded and loud whenever I go, but the food is really worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ben C.,"Denver, CO",4/22/2015,5.0,Unreal burgers and a booze list that will blow your mind. I ordered the elk burger and had the craft bourbon flight. A pricey meal but the best I've had in ages.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason H.,"Knoxville, TN",4/21/2015,5.0,"I am raising my review based on how the owner handled our previous visit, and how our experience was the second time we visited. After reading my review, the owner reached out to me personally, apologized, and gave us a gift certificate so we could try them again. He made no mention of reviewing them again or anything, it was just an apologetic gesture. He even asked us to describe the waiter so he could take corrective action. The second time we visited was a much better experience. We had ordered take out. As soon as I walked in, they lead me to the bar where they had my food ready. The bartender was polite and we had a friendly conversation as he rang up my order. The hostesses opened the door for me on the way out, smiled, and wished me to have a good day. Everyone was friendly, and the food was still amazing!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason H.,"Knoxville, TN",3/21/2015,2.0,"The food? Amazing. Probably the best burger I have ever had.  No joke. The. Best. Atmosphere? Okay, but cramped. Also, very loud. I could barely hear the person sitting across from me at my table. Loved the brick walls, the lighting, and the decor, however. Bathrooms? Dirty. The staff? Here we come to the reason for my low rating. The waiter was one of the worst I've ever had at any restaurant. We walk in, carrying our 10-month-old, and the waiter doesn't even ask us if we want a high chair. After we ordered our drinks, we asked for a high chair. The waiter literally rolled his eyes and sighed, and without a word he walked away and grabbed a high chair for us.After he finally came to take our food order, we almost never saw him again. I think only one of us ever got a refill the entire meal. We had to flag him down and stop him from walking by us to ask for some extra napkins, which resulted in more rolled eyes and sighs. It's a shame, really. This had the potential to be one of our favorite restaurants, but now we will likely never visit again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Martín G.,"Sacramento, CA",4/20/2015,5.0,"The best burger I have ever had, and I am a burger fan. I had the Farmhouse Burger. Simply amazing! The selection of Whiskeys and Bourbon is superb. I am here for 4 days, and at least 2 of my dinners have been here... so far. Go and enjoy the best burger ever!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael M.,"East Berlin, CT",4/19/2015,5.0,The duck Condit fries are without any doubt in my mind the best fries I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Absolutely wonderful food and attentive services makes this place easily a 5. Trust the servers burger recommendation. You won't be disappointed.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Bryan M.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2015,4.0,"The place was very crowded when we went (it was a Saturday), but the wait didn't seem that long because there was a band playing in Market Square.  They actually have a pretty good beer menu, and the food was great!  I would recommend getting the Spicy Crab Dip as an appetizer, but get two because you won't want to share!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dimitra S.,"Rockford, TN",4/14/2015,5.0,"If you love burgers this is your place. We have eaten here several times and are never disappointed. The atmosphere is fun, very small, and tonight's waiter- Hunter- was especially exceptional. Try the Billy burger, the elk burger and definitely the duck confit fries."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ashlyn R.,"Renton, WA",10/30/2017,4.0,"Amazing burgers and extremely friendly staff. Not too pricey for the location, food, and service. A little cramped inside, but outdoor seating is fine."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Davin E.,"Knoxville, TN",10/30/2015,4.0,"I have always got setted quickly, the servers have been nice and the bottom line, the food is great.  Even if you are a vegitarian, you can get a bean burger that is top of the line. Enjoy"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sean F.,"Brockton, MA",10/24/2017,5.0,"Best burger ever! Great food, great selection of Bourbon. A little small inside, but def worth the wait."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Deana P.,"Cincinnati, OH",10/15/2017,5.0,"Absolutely BEST burger. Period. We drive from Cincinnati to eat with family here, then head back. Appreciate the gf buns. Exceptional local beef from Mitchell's Farm."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelly G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/12/2015,5.0,"Oh...my...goodness, so if you've never eaten at Stock & Barrel then this is a MUST for anyone in the Knoxville area! The elk burger was the juiciest, most savory burger I have ever put in my mouth, and the whiskey is the best palette cleanser you can find in Market Square :-)  Go check it out for yourself!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matt T.,"Livermore, CA",2/8/2017,5.0,"amazing burgers and shakes.  onion rings are top notch, duck confit fries are great too.  Excellent whiskey selection with a handful of quality craft beers too.  Only complaint is we ordered our food and drinks at the same time, and our drinks came after the food arrived."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Addie A.,"Powell, TN",10/7/2017,5.0,"Came by on a whim with some friends before a show. I wasn't sure that I would find much to eat as I don't eat meat, but was delighted by the veggie burger options, and doubly delighted when our kind server offered a different setup for my burger that I hadn't realized I could get! It's the little things. Our drinks were always full- beer and water alike, and the service was quick, all the while still very friendly. My boyfriend loved his meal (the Bernie) and our friends were definitely happy as well. We all shared some friend pickles before our burgers that were insane. I wish I had caught our server's name. She had a structural formula of a chemical compound tattoo on her left forearm (I believe), and was blonde. She was really a pleasure, and great at her job. Thanks for a marvelous experience!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael T.,"Destin, FL",8/4/2014,5.0,Best food ever nothing negative to say. Make sure when in Knoxville stop in and see Al  the bartender. All the Staff are Awesome and very Friendly. Will defiantly be back
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Avi T.,"Knoxville, TN",12/30/2015,5.0,"Mouth-watering burgers that are so good-- you'll have a difficult time selecting just one.  I'm serious.  Three friends and I went there and each ordered a burger... then we cut them into quarters when they arrived.  I don't normally eat the bun on burgers, but this one is too good to leave behind!  Go hungry-- leave happy! TIP:  Male sure to call ahead for reservations.  The wait-- especially on weekends-- can be quite long!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shalynn H.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",3/14/2015,4.0,"The ""Free Bird"" burger was ok.  We love turkey burgers and try them all over.  The burger almost tasted frozen even though they told me it was not.  The bloody Belle drink was outstanding and we received excellent service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,A. L.,"Knoxville, TN",6/30/2014,5.0,"Everything I have had here is excellent, and I love that the food is locally sourced (though I'm unsure if it's just the meat and bread or everything). The ketchup tastes homemade, but again I'm not sure. The grilled chicken sandwich was really tasty, but the chicken was kind of dry. Maybe marinate it overnight in buttermilk or pound it out a little."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,RiShay T.,"Knoxville, TN",9/28/2015,4.0,"Always highly satisfied with the quality of food, preparation, and customer service. This is truly the best burger joint in the south east and never disappoints. Thanks, Stock 'n Barrel, you 'da best!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelley S.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",9/26/2015,5.0,"The BEST burgers in Knoxville, and probably the universe. So many choices that you will have to come back again and again. The fries are also incredible. I hear the salads are good but I can't stay away from the burgers. Don't miss out!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kayla W.,"Morristown, TN",9/24/2017,4.0,Really good food! Especially the pimento cheese. We went on a Friday night and the place was packed as they only have 19 tables. They told us it would be a one hour wait but ended up calling us after 20 minutes. Then proceeded to seat us outside even though we specified an indoor table. Staff was really nice and attentive.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelly M.,"Knoxville, TN",5/22/2015,5.0,"I'm not really a burger guy, and it's not something I usually crave, but the burgers here are amazing and sometimes I DO crave a burger from here.  Maybe the best burgers I've ever had in any city.  The ""Hurt Locker"" is fantastic and the ""Buffalo Burger"" it also great and not at all what you might expect it to be.  The only downside? It's not a secret that it's so good.  The wait times are often 2 hours, but hey, that's the price you pay for something so good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mel E.,"Knoxville, TN",9/16/2015,4.0,"Great place to get a burger!  The sandwich was huge and the fries were super tasty!  The atmosphere was everything the name suggests!  It is all about the whiskey/bourbon (of which I am not a fan, but my hubby is)."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shannon W.,"Concord, NC",2/4/2014,5.0,"This was recommended by a friend. Definitely worth the wait. We waited nearly an hour to get in. It is rather small and crowded, but yummy.  Clean atmosphere, bar scene at night.  I had ordered the lamb burger and my husband ordered a regular burger. They were the best we've ever had. The lamb burger was really juicy and full of flavor!  They were rather messy, but oh so good!  Their fries are fried in duck fat which gives them a great flavor.I ordered a pumpkin drink which was smooth and yummy!  They make it with Pumpkin moonshine and  vanilla vodka. I tried to make it at home, which was not nearly at good as at the restaurant. I would recommend getting their early or calling ahead to see if they are busy. They have cell phone alerts to tell you when your table is about ready, which was great. We walked around Market Square and visited the sites / stores as we waited. We went while they had the ice skating in the middle of the square and people watching was fun.This restaurant is definitely on my top 10 list for burgers!! Definitely get there early and try the lamb burger. SO very worth it!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alyson C.,"Washington, DC",5/5/2017,4.0,Solid burgers.  A lot of people seem to think so - it gets quite crowded during week-day lunch hours.  So plan on coming early to avoid the wait!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Emily C.,"Baldwinsville, NY",8/31/2017,5.0,"This was a great experience-- the restaurant had a modern vibe, but had all kinds of customers. It was nice to have a small menu with unique choices. Everyone's meals were great, the place was clean, and the service was impeccable. Our waitress was on top of her game and kind, even though it was closing time. The other staff members were friendly too. Definitely a place you want to go to if you like trying out different burgers (or classic ones too)!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelly C.,"Jacksonville, FL",8/29/2015,5.0,"The burgers come out hot! The ingredients taste fresh! Our server was genuine and chill! The Hurt Locker is a juicy, delicious mess! The Dead Head is clean tasting with fresh ingredients. Wow. And the duck fries. Yum."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cal D.,"Murfreesboro, TN",1/25/2014,3.0,"Well, this is our first visit and it's late in the evening, likely after a weekend rush. I ask for what's on tap and I'm directed to the list on my table. Fair enough, but when I chose a brew the server brought me a bottle of it and not a pint. O_o She then asks if we're ready to order and asks how I'd like my burger. I request it ""medium"" but it comes out ""well"". *smh* I recommend the place but just double-check behind your server. I could give a better rating save these two blunders. Cautious dining, foodies."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Karly B.,"Vancouver, WA",11/9/2014,5.0,"Listen y'all....this place is awesome.  In Knoxville for one night and wanted something laid back but tasty.  This definitely fits the bill!I ordered the Hurt Locker burger with onion rings and they both were perfection.  They've got this pimento cheese that rocked my world, and let me tell you that is saying something - I'm a Wisconsin native!!  As for the drinks, well I'm not a bourbon girl but their inventory is impressive.  I watched some fantastic-looking cocktails crafted before my eyes; carrying on the restaurant's mission of serving house-made fare.As far as service goes, I did have to wait a bit for dessert (fried Apple pie with THE flakiest crust ever!), but the staff was happy to check on it and never once wavered in being friendly or attentive despite being crazy busy.  So squeeze yourself into a spot at the bar and chat with the locals, or wait a few minutes to be seated.  Either way, you're going to get great food and drink at a reasonable price.  You can't go wrong!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ian G.,"Knoxville, TN",9/23/2014,4.0,"Consistently great burgers. You can taste the high quality. Not many sides but they're all good, and fresh. Service always top notch. The seating is pretty tight and limited and not very comfortable (no cushions). We like this restaurant and continue to come back. Best burger I've had in Knoxville, no other burger even close... why 4 stars instead of 5 then?.... just such a tight crowded uncomfortable atmosphere..."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kate S.,"Williamsburg, VA",7/29/2017,5.0,Probably one of the best restaurants in Knoxville. Even when it's busy our food comes out at a very decent time. Hot too! The waitresses are always very friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend giving it a try!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Miranda W.,"Denver, CO",1/1/2017,5.0,We had great service. The vibe is very hip even though the restaurant is small. I had the salmon burger and tomato salad. Both were delicious and a great match together. I also had a Smores milkshake. It tasted more like a frosty than Smores but it was okay. It was kind of small for $5.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Emily B.,"Knoxville, TN",11/6/2016,3.0,"I got the farmhouse burger here and it was my first time visiting. I mean, the farmhouse burger was good but it wasn't like I was about to stand up flip my table over and shout to the world how my mouth is burning of deliciousness. I had heard tons of great things about this place, but I feel like it was because people had ordered their wacky burgers. I personally don't like blue cheese or pimento cheese and that was like the majority of cheeses on the burgers. And yes I'm sure you're asking ""well why didn't you ask for it without that?"" well..because then it wouldn't have been same in terms of the flavors they were attempting the mesh together and I wanted something whole for my first time. I don't know why they have blue cheese over everything anyways...they need to have more variety of cheeses with other flavors. Anyways, the only thing that I actually thought was really good was the bacon on the burgers. I've never had bacon that good on a burger. All 3/5 because the bacon was great and it seemed like it had potential, but it didn't hit the spot for me."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Wayne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",8/23/2016,4.0,"BURGERS GALORE It's my understanding that all the ground beef served here is from Mitchell Family Farm in Blaine, Tenn., and that Emilia (right across Market Square) and nearby Knox Mason (both outstanding in their own right and operated by Knoxville's top chef ---to date--- Matt Gallaher) purchase their high end beef cuts from the same farm, thus allowing Mitchell's to butcher 3 cows a week these days, up from 2 not so long ago. Everyone benefits, especially the restaurants' customers since Mitchells is widely regarded as the top producer of pasture fed hormone free beef in these here parts. Since the beef needs to be cooked and served in a delicious fashion, kudos to the Stock chef. His 'Merican, with American cheese, tomato, red onion, mayo, greens and house pickles, served on a specialty flour dusted bun from Flour Head Bakery in Knoxville, is as good of a burger as I've ever had. And do get onion rings as a side . . . they're a must! Stock & Barrel is small and much loved so expect a wait if you don't go early and they don't take reservations."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,R B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/28/2015,5.0,I'm a big fan. The buorbon selection is great. The burgers are incredible.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Boyd W.,"Madisonville, TN",9/23/2015,5.0,"This company is the best in the area for cleaning carpets.  We are very pleased to have non crunchy carpets. The owner of this business came to do the estimate and is also the person who cleaned our carpets.  You could not ask for a nicer man.  He was so polite, professional and gracious.  Our carpets are so, so soft and not crunchy/stiff like they have been in the past.  They are also supper clean and soft to this day (two months out).  Do yourself a favor and have your carpets cleaned by by Quick Dry in Athens........you will be so glad you did."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mary B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2015,4.0,"One of the best burgers in Knoxville-- well, really in the world."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/15/2015,5.0,"The Bison burger is one I've had a few times now and liked. Last night tried the elk burger (special) and salmon burger and both were good. Everyone always likes the duck fries, too. Best part about this place though is locally sourced foods."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Luke S.,"Denver, CO",3/10/2014,5.0,Great vibe and the Farmhouse burger was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chris D.,"Cleveland, OH",9/24/2014,4.0,"Excellent burger! Meat was tasty, I really dig the bun and bacon. The onion rings were good, not great. Coworker had the buffalo burger was raving about it. Sat at the bar and got great service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason G.,"Knoxville, TN",9/20/2014,5.0,"Delicious! Had a wonderful bourbon, opa! Cheese app, duck confit fries, and the best burger in Knoxville! Love the decor, service, extensive inventory of bourbon, but the food is the star."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Clay W.,"Mandeville, LA",11/4/2014,5.0,A great experience. Great waitress and the choice of whiskey is great. I had a pilsnwr beer and knob creek 100 proof on 1 ball ice (don't know how to say it lol)
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cody F.,"Knoxville, TN",1/31/2014,5.0,"I have eaten here several times and each time I visit I get more and more impressed. I've never ordered a thing from the menu I wasn't exceptionally happy with. This is the best place for burgers in town, hands down. I highly recommend the farmhouse but do not glaze over when they read the specials, they're excellent as well (the El Flama Blanca special blew me away). Their fries are crisp, appetizers mouth watering (grab the pimento cheese/goat cheese concoction), and entrees mind blowing. Oh, and to top it off they have an extensive whiskey selection and they're reasonably priced. They stay pretty busy but they have an app that will text you when your table is ready. Go grab a drink at Scruffy City Hall across the square and wait for your table, it's worth it."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dale R.,"Charlotte, NC",8/7/2014,4.0,Read a review they had great burgers. I don't know abut great but pretty good for sure. Mostly a whiskey bar as the beer selection was low. Down in the market area so you can walk around afterwards and sit outside and listen to some music.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kate N.,"Santa Monica, CA",9/3/2016,5.0,"Delicious burgers and tomato salad! Very tasty, chill bar/restaurant with nice, friendly staff. If I lived here, I would absolutely be a regular!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joseph M.,"Crystal Lake, IL",1/2/2017,5.0,"Came here twice when I was in town for a few nights on my brother in laws recommendation as the Best Burger in Knoxville.  well he was right, it was one of the best burgers I've had at a restaurant in a very long time.. And our bartender was great and had me try several new Bourbons I had not had before..  Great place, needs to be a little bigger.."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cristina A.,"Miami, FL",12/31/2014,5.0,Everything we had was delicious! My favorites were the fired green tomatoes and the fried pickles! They have a lot of bourbon to choose from! Very cool place! Oh and the smores milkshake was amazing!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kevin N.,"Knoxville, TN",7/31/2015,5.0,"Wow, this place is awesome!  The food is very good - some of the best hamburgers you will ever have.  The wait during peak times can be a bit much but there is plenty to do in market square while you wait.  Highly recommended."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Summer S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/29/2015,4.0,"You cannot get a better burger in Knoxville. Actually, you probably can't get a better burger anywhere.  The Hurt Locker is one of my favorites.  The fries are good too! Go here. Right now."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Pat H.,"Clinton, TN",9/27/2015,5.0,"Best burgers in Knoxville!  On the weekends (because it's not on the menu), ask for the elk burger (medium rare, of course) with duck confit fries!  The burger comes with havarti cheese and sautéed mushrooms. The duck fat fries are served with garlic aioli - and they are scrumptious!  The ""Greek "" lamb burger is another favorite. It's served with tzatziki and feta cheese. Absolutely delicious. This place is a regular stop!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joshua B.,"Waco, TX",8/20/2014,4.0,Upscale burger place in downtown Knoxville. Burgers are great and the duck fries are amazing. They have lots of different burgers to choose from so if you are an adventurous eater this place is for you!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,April S.,"Sweetwater, TN",8/24/2013,2.0,"Let's start with this was opening night so I understand there is a learning curve. I want to start with the positives: 1) large selection of whiskey 2) fries were good Now that's out of the way...While our server was very nice, she was extremely unknowledgeable about the menu and whiskey. I asked about a burger that was online (Mexican) which was not on the menu handed to us. She said she'd ask about that. She came back and said it was the same as the Ring of Fire. I showed her online that it CLEARLY was not the same burger, completely different toppings. She shrugged & said she didn't know then. Hmmm...ok...well then. Thanks for putting in that extra effort to find out why. Next we ordered drinks. Which basically took forever. I finally got my drink & then my husband was told they were out of Sazerac. So he ordered a Manhattan with Bullet. She question him about what Bullet, she asked HIM, umm do we have Bullet? He said, well it is on your menu. She said she would go check. We ordered a water. Let's move on. We had ordered fried pickle appetizer. While they were good, um the smallest order of fried pickles ever. Barely enough for four people to have 2 small pickles each. After about 45 min we finally get our food. My husband still does not have his drink nor do we have our water. I ordered the mushroom burger. Ummm. It was awful. So much horseraddish my eyes were watering. I get a mushroom burger at every burger place we visit and I've never had one with horseradish. And it clearly does not belong with mushroom and Swiss. Mayo mayo mayo. I scrapped it off and put ketchup on it. It wouldn't have mattered anyway because the buns were too soggy to eat on ALL our bugers. Gross. Now let's talk about my meat. I eat my steaks basically mooing. My burger was so raw that I almost couldn't eat it. Maybe I should have sent it back but I was starving & I did not want to wait any longer. I prayed I didn't get sick. My parents ordered theirs well done & still was wayyyy pink. I happened to notice the table beside of us & theirs was slightly pink. I leaned over and asked them if they ordered theirs well done & they said no, it just came that way. Then I was really worried about mine. I was almost done & showed them & they gasped in horror. Yep. I just put it to the side & finished my fries. Finally my husband gets his drink & I get my water. And we get the bill. She asked how we liked it. None if us at the table said anything & she just bubbly haha-ed it off & said she'd be back for payment. I felt bad for because she was really nice but it doesn't make up for the fact that she did not know anything about what she was serving & we got our drinks after we were almost finished. She kept blaming it on the bar, but ummm what about that water I ordered? Not sure if we will be back. It has the right idea (like Urban Stack in Chattanooga - which we love) but poor execution."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stacie O.,"Lewis Center, OH",8/2/2017,5.0,Very good food. They have a great bar too. Don't pay your bill and change your mind because you will never see the waiter again.  After I didn't see my waiter I tried to go to bar and bartender INSISTED I order through the waiter which seemed not so customer friendly.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Darren C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/15/2013,4.0,"Ate here last Saturday with my girlfriend.  Located next to the Blue Coast Burrito, this is a small sitdown with industrial decor that states in the menu they get their meat from local farmers.  They really sell the burger and whiskey menu to me.  Lots of whiskey options if that's your thing.  I admit we mainly ate here because other more popular places were packed.  But I'm so glad we did!  The smell that emanating from the cracks and crevices onto the patio beckoned so we proceeded inside.  We were seated promptly and started with the fried pickles.  They were just ok to me but I think my girlfriend really liked them.  It was a sizeable portion and they didn't taste like they do at other places; more cucumber-y than pickle-y to be specific.  I ordered the Turkey Burger (can't remember what it's called) with onion rings and my girlfriend had the Elvis and french fries.  My turkey burger was cooked to perfection and very juicy.  The onion rings are some of the best I've had in a long time- highly recommended!!!!  Next time I'll venture out and eat an actual burger.  I'm extremely picky about red meat.  So one thing to know about the Elvis-  it comes with peanut butter, fried bananas, bacon on a burger.  The last part is not mentioned in the menu description so we were surprised when it hit the table.  My girlfriend thought it was really good and said she would eat it again.  The french fries were really good... but not as good as the onion rings in my opinions.  Next time, we'll have to try one of their milkshakes as we saw many coming out from the kitchen and they passed the eye test!  If you're looking for a burger on Market Square then give this place a try!  I should mention this since it's fall that they only have 1-2 TVs so I probably wouldn't meet up here just to watch a game."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alexa F.,"Louisville, KY",7/28/2015,5.0,"If you are craving a burger, this is the place to go! They have an excellent selection of burgers and bourbon. Not to mention, all of their meats are locally and responsibly sourced! Be weary of weekends though because you will most likely have to wait for a table."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ethan S.,"Jonesboro, AR",3/12/2016,4.0,"Ate here for the first time today and wasn't disappointed. The restaurant is located in a pretty cool part of knoxville and the atmosphere inside was nice. Good music and not too loud. The food was delicious. I had the elk burger, which was imported from new Zealand and on special for the day. Wonderfully cooked and seasoned. The fries were delicious as well. The only complaint I have is the draft beer selection. Although the selections they had were decent, they were very limited. Can't complain too much about that as the restaurant caters more to the bourbon/whiskey drinker. I would definitely go back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shannon M.,"Knoxville, TN",7/24/2015,5.0,"Amazing burgers, rustic feel.  Great place for a first date or a night out with the girls/guys. They seem to accommodate any reasonable request and although the place is small, it seats many comfortably."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paul C.,"Charlotte, NC",1/2/2015,5.0,"Paul's Yelp Elite Review Rating: 4.75 rounded UP to 5 Stars!Me and my best friends Steve and Dean came back here to stock and barrel for lunch because it is extremely difficult to get into this restaurant at dinner since it is so small. It only has 7 tables and about 15 seats at the bar area so it is quite compact, so be expected to wait long hours or come back at lunch time like we did especially during the week. Obviously the reason to come to this place is for their burgers. And let me tell you they do their burgers absolutely right at this place! We all got different burgers but I had the Farmhouse burger, which had a succulent egg on top, applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, onions tomatoes and I added extra mushrooms. We were told that the beef is sourced locally and also most of the vegetables are local as is the cheese, and the bun is made in Knoxville. My God was this burger sloppy, just the way I love it and as it should be! I got my burger medium with just a dab of red in the middle. The meat was perfectly seasoned and all the ingredients worked extremely well together. The piece de resistance was the hand cut fries which were fried in duck fat! Yes, duck fat! Their burgers usually come with their hand cut fries, but for an extra two bucks, definitely upgrade to the duck fat fries!Since the three of us are pretty big eaters I also ordered their beer battered onion rings, and these were some of the best onion rings I have had in a very long time! The batter was light and fluffy and the onions were obviously sweet and the flavor was just excellent. Even though it was lunchtime, this place is a whiskey bar, so I felt I had to ""take one"" for the Yelp Elite Team  and try a flight of their whiskeys! If you take a look at one of the photos I posted there's a list of the whiskey's offered from inexpensive to outrageous! They have a very rare Kentucky Bourbon that they pay almost a thousand dollars a bottle for, and for $100 you too could have a shot. That's a little rich for my blood, being the wineo that I am, so I opted for a $16 ""Stock and Barrel"" bourbon flight. I thought this to be a really good deal given the quality of the Bourbons they poured. Each was about three quarter of an ounce which actually is a fairly generous poor for what you're getting. Keep in mind that these are distilled spirits so its quite potent! Our bartender, Ben, was super as he was a younger guy who obviously was schooled in the wonders of bourbon. And he helps guide me through my selection.I just wish this place was a little bit larger to accommodate the obviously overwhelming demand that they are experiencing here in Knoxville. They really need to open another location especially out in West Knoxville.bIt of course would be awesome to come out to Charlotte North Carolina where I live as we would eat this place up!Highly, highly recommended!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cristina A.,"Miami, FL",12/31/2014,5.0,Everything we had was delicious! My favorites were the fired green tomatoes and the fried pickles! They have a lot of bourbon to choose from! Very cool place! Oh and the smores milkshake was amazing!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Hunter M.,"Washington, DC",12/29/2014,3.0,I've given Stock & Barrel two shots now and I'm just not impressed.  It's a decent burger but I've certainly had much better.  They often times feel too complicated or like there are two many different tastes thrown between two buns.  I've also never been able to get one that's not been overcooked.  Maybe they are just concerned about undercooked meat but if I ask for it medium to medium-rare I want to see pink.  Both milkshakes I've had went unfinished and just weren't that good.  It seems like Stock & Barrel is winning people over by piling different and new ingredients on burgers but not really giving much consideration to how those burgers taste.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chuck C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/23/2014,5.0,I like hot and spicy and everything here has a warning and it's not even spicy.  I have started ignoring the warning.  I got the hot pepper burger here and almost died.  It was so hot it made my lips numb.  Delicious!  I think they might have the best burgers in town.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jessica R.,"Knoxville, TN",12/16/2014,4.0,"It's a small restaurant, so it can feel crowded easily. The burgers, however, are worth the hype. They use Benton's bacon, a Maple Bourbon Mustard for their Chicken and Waffles, and their Garlic Aioli is mouth wateringly delicious. Really, just reading through all the original kinds of burgers you can try is worth the trip alone. If you want a beverage, stick to the bourbon since that is what they're known for. Their beer and wine selection is mediocre and overpriced."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Elisabeth B.,"Livermore, CA",12/15/2014,4.0,"On a long drive home this was a welcome stop. Located in a paved pedestrian area we found free15 minute street parking.While we called in a to-go order from the highway we still had to wait and additional 20 minutes at the bar above our quoted time. Super happy we didn't get a parking ticket with our to-go order.That was soon forgotten once we received our orders. We tried the Elvis with peanut butter and banana and a grilled chicken option. I usually consider grilled chicken a cop out order but I was looking for something healthy...and dang that was a good sandwich. My boyfriend has downed his burger before I was done with my side. Their buns are the reason I would come back- fresh baked, soft and make the carbs oh so worth it.Meats are free-range, happy proteins and for a small up-charge you can change your side.  Next time we are passing through this will make the must stop list again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matthew V.,"Bellbrook, OH",12/1/2014,5.0,on this choice I turned to Yelp for help.standing in the park like setting of market square I saw at least six places to eat.chose Stock n Barrel based on reviews.what a great choice.lots and lots of places claim to have a GREAT burger.this place has one of the better burgers I have ever had.I swear I saw the BK King hiding in the corner drinking whiskey and eating a free range burger.the bun is a local crafted masterpiece. step inside and chose from 150 bourbons.have a burger.tell them the King sent you.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sergey G.,"Indianapolis, IN",11/26/2014,3.0,"Although my cocktail was not prepared properly, the management handled the situation in a very professional manner that increased my opinion about the place. Very nice atmosphere and location on the market sq."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael L.,"Atlanta, GA",11/21/2014,5.0,"Place is good! Elvis burger tasted like a doughnut. Bison burger was fantastic. Ordered medium, cooked as I ordered. Toppings was good. Great place."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lindy P.,"Denver, CO",11/19/2014,5.0,"If you're searching for the best burger in Knoxville, look no further.... Stock & Barrel won't let you down.  Since it's in the busy Market Square, be prepared to wait for a table.  The dining room isn't big, though they do have about 10 seats at the bar and a large community table that could accommodate maybe 14-16 people.  The decor is very industrial with a lot of wood, metal, and exposed brick.  The service was top notch, and the host even takes your number and will text you when your table is ready.  They have about 8 craft brews (a few locals), but there specialty is bourbon.... and lots of it.  They offer 4 different flights of bourbon for your sampling, and they have probably 50+ otherwise.  We started with fried pickles, which you can never go wrong with.  I ordered the classic bacon burger cooked rare with a side of fries, and the burger was cooked perfect!  The meat was very well seasoned and the bun was very fresh.  This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Knoxville, so I hope you can share the same experiences I've had!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jalaal E.,"Chattanooga, TN",3/5/2015,4.0,"Burgers are good, but i prefer mine medium well to well done. I ordered my burger done medium well, and it was more towards medium. the flavor is still solid and their sides are amazing."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jim M.,"Amelia, OH",10/28/2016,4.0,"Bourbon fizze......lots of great burger .. the Elvis, yep -peanut butter and fried bananas on a burger... how can you go wrong"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason J.,"Knoxville, TN",3/1/2017,4.0,Long waits to get in.  Really good burgers.  Really good selection of bourbon. S'mores shake is the best thing ever.  Duck confit fries were a little greasy.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael S.,"Wilmington, NC",8/10/2014,5.0,"If you are looking for a plain cheeseburger don't bother coming here.  However, if you are excited about a delicious burger loaded with all kinds of innovative toppings make sure you visit this place. Plenty of good whiskey to try while you are here as well.  If you don't like it neat or on ice, lots of classy cocktails made with quality ingredients are available (wish I could make an old fashioned at home as good as the ones I've had here). I can't comment on the dessert as I have been too full to try those selections each time we have been here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Eric H.,"Knoxville, TN",2/24/2015,5.0,"I've visited twice now, and the food has been excellent both times.If you get there at peak lunch or dinner times, the wait can be very long because the restaurant is small."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Madeline P.,"Maryville, TN",8/1/2016,5.0,This place is great. I think they have the best burgers in this town. The Duck confeit fries are amazing! Plan for an hour wait. So put your name and grab a few drinks at P-pubs first. They have a buger with tomato paste and goat cheese..AMAZING.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Wenston R.,"Knoxville, TN",5/16/2015,4.0,Great burgers here.  Sauce on the fries is really good. Expect to wait. Lot of people are here often.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,J S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/19/2016,4.0,"It sounds a little strange to say it, but the burgers really are great!  Service has always been good as well.  I love the mill cut lumber interior.  The only thing I don't like is the size.  I try not to go here with more than 2 people."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cheran C.,"JAMAICA, NY",7/27/2014,5.0,The medium bison buger was amazing!!....and we had a really great service as well. Coupled with the tomato salad this place was the best place I have visited so far.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matt S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/9/2015,5.0,"Had the Elvis Presley, stunningly good burger. Duck Confit fries also top notch. And the bourbon, oh my the bourbon."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Stephanie D.,"Knoxville, TN",2/5/2015,1.0,"Make sure you drink plenty of whiskey to counteract the food poisoning.  I've never been so sick in my entire life. Also the service was terrible,  never going back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Scott S.,"Knoxville, TN",8/26/2013,5.0,"What a great addition to downtown Knoxville. The veggie burger was one of the best i've ever (ever) had.  The service great given that it was day #2. I can't wait to go back, may be today???"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kevin H.,"Gum Spring, VA",7/10/2014,5.0,"Best burger I've ever had. Granted, it was bison which is usually better than beef. But this burger was marvelous and the duck confit fries were stunning. Washing it down with Four Roses Single Barrell: priceless."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brad M.,"Roanoke, VA",1/25/2014,5.0,My favorite restaurant on earth. Burgers are out of this world. Amazing drinks. Duck confit fries. Incredible
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Tobey N.,"Knoxville, TN",9/16/2016,5.0,Just wow! The burgers are amazing. So juicy and love the unique toppings. I love their onion rings but their fries are muh. I always go for lunch because the wait at dinner is ridiculous.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Camille C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/17/2015,5.0,"Some of the best burgers I've ever had. I don't normally even like veggie burgers, but I'm tempted to get the Deadhead (black bean burger) every time because it's SO good. Expect a wait - but you will be notified by text when your table is ready, so you're free to roam Market Square and grab drinks elsewhere beforehand."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/9/2018,2.0,"I send all my out of town business visitors to the Stock & Barrel because it is phenomenal but I've never had an experience personally like I did Wednesday.  I had a large group that I was taking out and showed up at 5 pm to get a table and a few drinks while waiting for them.  I was told that a single person couldn't be seated at a large table without half of the group present.  When I pointed out that the largest table in the room had exactly that, I was told he seated himself and there was nothing that could be done.  When half my group appeared I was told we would have a long wait (no time specified) but we could sit outside in 55 degree weather with winds under 1 heat lamp.  When I asked if we could put the outside tables together so we could eat together, I was told they never had arranged them such.  When I asked if we could be seated at the low tables inside in batches as they opened up, I was told that we couldn't do that because although we'd been waiting an hour, we weren't on the small table list and they just couldn't do it.  So I took my 14 visitors to Babalu's where I will no be sending my business visitors.  No matter what solution I tried to offer, it couldn't be done.  This makes me sad because Stock & Barrel has always been a personal favorite."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Heather S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/10/2015,5.0,"Love this place.  We had the fried green tomatoes and a couple burgers.  The tomatoes were off the chart and we both loved the burgers...juicy, flavorful, yum!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cam M.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",8/26/2016,5.0,"Great service and awesome burgers. Tried the duck fries which they are known for. They were ok, but the onion rings are way better. But I'm from Michigan, so I wasn't familiar with duck fries."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Lauren C.,"Jersey City, NJ",6/12/2016,5.0,"I absolutely LOVE Stock & Barrel. Their spicy crab dip is extremely good, the chips are a little spicy but just enough. It is a whiskey bar so their whiskey selection is fantastic. I love the burger with the fried egg (I think it's called the Farmhouse) and both their duck confit and regular fries. I always have the NOR'EASTER but change the bourbon for Maker's Mark. Overall, this is the one place I keep going back to over and over, even if I'm trying to visit all the downtown restaurants at least once. It can get very crowded and wait times are long in the weekends, they do not take reservations so make sure to take this into account when planning your visit. My husband and I always end up sitting at the bar so we don't ever wait for a table. Speaking of the bar... all the bartenders are so cool, I wish I remembered all their names but I can remember 2 girls and 2 guys and they are super friendly and make great drinks. I know it's a lengthy review, but if your in the mood for a burger and/or whiskey look no further!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,J J.,"Knoxville, TN",12/23/2016,5.0,"Absolutely awesome consistently, hence the popularity and the typical long wait to get a table. Great menu of gourmet burgers. One of my top favorite restaurants in Knoxville. My favorite is the Veggie Deadhead burger.  It is the best veggie burger that I have ever eaten!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Justin H.,"Johnson City, TN",12/9/2016,5.0,"Best burger in Knoxville and awesome atmosphere on Market Square.  Stock & Barrel offers many burger and whiskey options.  The only downfall is the small location and often long wait time.  Burgers are a bit pricier but worth it, It would be nice if a larger location opened."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Paloma D.,"Knoxville, TN",11/11/2015,5.0,Best burger in Knoxville in my opinion. I get the farmhouse which has an egg on it and it is delicious. Also they have amazing fried pickles!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Christina B.,"Knoxville, TN",1/10/2014,5.0,"So happy to have this in Knoxville ! As half vegetarian  I am happy to say their black bean burger is amazing and as delicious, as the salmon burger ! My meat eating friends were more then satisfied with Their burgers and especially the fried chicken and waffles! Their fried picked and fried green tomatoes were the best I've had! The breading is amazing.  Don't forget about the spicy crab dip and the best mac and cheese !! I can go on and on but the real kicker is the many options to go on your burger from Benton's bacon, homemade spicy mustard, avocado, fresh jalapeños, creamy horseradish, and for the weirdees peanut butter and bananas ! I've ate here twice in the last week and can't wait to go back! The sweet tea and array of adult drinks is just a plus to this already perfect place !"

Thanks Stock and Barrel!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Renee R.,"Knoxville, TN",2/26/2014,4.0,"Delicious burgers, great beer  in beautiful Market Square. Employees are great. Only downside is it is exceptionally small, so finding a table could be an issue on a weekend."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,J W.,"Knoxville, TN",4/11/2016,5.0,"Great burger place in Market Square; they have an extensive bar and great options on their menu. The hot pimento cheese dip is awesome. Their burgers are fantastic. I'm not a fan of their fries but I'm not a fan of the fresh-peeled style anyway. When they first opened their water tasted awful but they have since fixed that issue. I've never had to wait for a table before but I have seen where the line is out the door/the place is packed to the gils so if you're going on a weekend night or a day/night that Market Square is having an event, I would suggest you get there early or see if they accept reservations/call ahead."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Trina M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/30/2016,4.0,Atmosphere is fun and social.  Have to be prepared to wait to be seated.  The space is small and it is popular.  Service is positive and drinks are yummy.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brady S.,"Elburn, IL",3/28/2016,5.0,Stock and Barrel was simply awesome.  From the Fried Shrooms to the Wedge salad to the Burger.  All elements were totally fresh and homemade.  The balsamic reduction with the buttermilk blue cheese dressing was unique and delicious.  The service was great and the atmosphere was perfect.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Joe S.,"Powell, TN",2/4/2016,5.0,"Food is really good.  Expensive.  Worst thing is the noise both from all of the wood, the tiny place, the tables that are insanely close, and the volume they keep the music.  Bring your phone so you can take pictures, it seems like the thing to do.  Helpful local tip - Sit at the bar."

Stopped in Knoxville on a cross country road trip and my couchsurfing host told me that this place had the best burgers in town so, of course, I had to go. I had the bison burger with the duck confit fries. Let me just give you the description for this burger: Grimini, Shitake, Button Mushrooms, Bourbon Cheese, Crispy Onions, Garlic Aioli, served with Duck Confit Fries. It was all unbelievably delicious. Those fries! We sat outside because my friend had his dog with him and they brought a water bowl out. Drew was our waiter and he was a great one, super friendly! It started drizzling a bit and they helped us tuck the table underneath the little overhang. Worth it!"

stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Celeste H.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",5/3/2014,5.0,"Bourbon and magnificent burgers, do you need a better reason?! Go here now, and thank me later."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Marcie C.,"Charlotte, NC",4/17/2014,5.0,Very extensive bourbon offering along with other dark liquors. Bartender seemed to really know a lot about the drink menu. The duck confit fries were pretty tasty. Ordered a burger toward closing time. Had to send it back as it was too much on the rare side. The one they brought back was almost cooked as ordered.  Didn't want to send it back again.  Overall good experience and I would go back if I am in the area again.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Karen S.,"Arlington, VA",4/9/2014,4.0,Had the chicken and waffle sandwich and just wow! So good! It is hard to find a place that gets the right chicken to waffle ratio but this one does it. Also really like sandwich aspect. The place is small so be prepared to wait if going during peak times.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rina M.,"Nashville, TN",3/17/2014,5.0,"There is absolutely nothing negative to say about Stock & Barrel. My first time was yesterday. I was impressed with their food, the facility, the servers (mine and  others) their bathrooms and the ambiance. This is definitely a place I know where people evolve into regulars.The inside of their restaurant is lightly-dimmed and intimate. While much of their light focuses on their wide selection of whiskey, set atop a shelf, like highly-praised classic novels at a library, don't forget your date sitting inches away from you. You can tell they pride themselves on their whiskey, because I could not spot one clear bottle up there. The lowly-dimmed lights create a more intimate experience at the Stock & Barrel. So you probably wouldn't be seen scarfing down their delightful burgers, with mayo, horse radish or bleu cheese fondue oozing out of your bottom lip. Relax. The servers are welcoming and kind. My server prepared my order right  the very first time. Not only was my order  on point, but the man who sat next to me seemed pleased with his waiter. The customer next to me was inquiring about the different selection of beers they offered and his server was dedicated enough to provide him with samples that would suit his palate for the day. TIP: You have to come here for their burgers. I enjoy turkey and veggie burgers more often than red meat, but yesterday, I thought I would only be depriving myself and regretfully living my life if I did not indulge in their godly-crafted creations. So I did. I chose the Shroomer (because mushrooms are a thing for me) and I wolfed it down like a mad man. I was with my date, and I don't even think we said a single word to one another, unless our conversation spoke and breathed Stock & Barrel's burgers. Their burger names are entertaining and you can possibly tell a story with each of them, considering they're fun and quirky.Their shakes - I was fortunate enough to invest my thirst and hunger into their S'more shake. It was not overbearingly sweet, but had enough flavor to bring me back to SoCal's bonfire nights: it tasted as if I was having a s'more in the form of a shake - nothing less, nothing more. Their bathrooms didn't smell like a bathroom, well-stocked and are clean (at least the women's) - What else do you need to know about their bathrooms?I would come back here and suggest everyone to try this place out if you're in town."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John W.,"Memphis, TN",2/22/2014,4.0,"The good: food was tasty. Was surprised to find vegetarian options. Beer selection was adequate. Bourbon selection was outstanding. Ambience was comfortable. The bad: service was very good when I arrived at 3 PM and they were not busy. But as they got busier, service slipped noticeably. I was going to order another bourbon, but decided not to after having to wait forever to get checked on. Overall, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, and will gladly return."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Rachel C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/18/2014,5.0,"One of my new favorites! The only drawback is the wait, but you can put your name down and go have a drink somewhere else.  The hurt locker is awesome. Fried green tomatoes delish! The confit fries are worth the calories. Any bar that uses Buffalo Trace as well bourbon is high on my list. You cannot go wrong here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason K.,"Knoxville, TN",5/10/2016,5.0,"I'm not a fan of bourbon, but I love this place. Best burgers in Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Harold B.,"Glen Burnie, MD",8/30/2015,3.0,"I would give this place 3.5 stars. Restaurant itself is very small but they have outside seating available. We got seated without wait, all the burgers on the menu looked quite good and creative, ended up ordering the Greek burger and upgraded the regular fries to Duck Confit Fries. The burger was really good even though little undercooked. I don't know why all the reviewers rave about the duck confit fries because in despite of their nice presentation they were really greasy. Prices are little on the higher side."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jacqui M.,"Cary, NC",4/26/2016,4.0,"The drinks were good and reasonably priced for the quality. The burger was really good and everything tasted fresh - in addition, the burger was cooked perfectly for what we were looking for. We got the duck con frit fries instead of regular fries and weren't terribly impressed and next time will probably just stick with the regular fries. The place knows what it is good at (burgers and bourbon) and sticks to that instead of trying to be overly impressive with a huge menu and I think it works to their advantage!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Marcus C.,"Knoxville, TN",3/11/2015,4.0,"Usually a wait, but great burgers & bourbon. Duck confit fries are a must."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alan H.,"Maryville, TN",8/3/2014,1.0,"My family and I went to Stock and Barrel this evening, just a few hours ago, to try their ""natural"" take on cuisine. My father ordered their ""The Wedge"" salad, and asked if it was possible to add salmon on top. Our waitress said it wasn't a problem, so he ordered it. When the salad came out, there was a whole salmon patty just plopped on top of the salad, not prepared. Come to find out that the salmon patty either had not been cooked properly or was contaminated. My father has fallen drastically ill in only a couple of short hours after leaving the restaurant. He's vomiting as I write this. We will not be returning.Only eat here if you enjoy seeing your food twice."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kelli O.,"Knoxville, TN",9/28/2013,4.0,"I've been here a few times and I can tell you the food is amazing. The Farmhouse burger is my favorite! The onion rings are great (skip the fries). My only complaints are that there isn't much room (it's in market square so that's believable).....and it's too loud. I'd complain about how expensive the whiskey is, but it's normal price for drinking out. Go for the food! You won't be disappointed!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Teri O.,"Knoxville, TN",9/20/2013,2.0,"We just had lunch here 9/20/13. We ordered the Deadhead black bean burger with the same toppings from another burger. We also ordered the side of Village salad and the black bean/corn salad. First, the place is small and you are sitting really close to the next table. So, make sure your conversation is something you don't mind them hearing! :) Salad was good--nothing great. Burger was dry and didn't have any ""zing"" to it. Bun was excellent(homemade). I don't think we'd go back anytime soon for food. Maybe drinks at the bar when they start a Happy Hour. As of today, they don't have one. Server told me they'll implement when they figure one out-----don't you think this should have been thought about BEFORE opening?"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,B. T.,"Belleville, Canada",8/11/2015,5.0,"I am puzzled why I didn't review this restaurant earlier.  We stopped for an overnight in Knoxville on December 26th 2014 with hopes of trying Stock & Barrel and found, unfortunately, it was closed for the holidays.  Luckily we found another great restaurant (Five) and enjoyed the market square area very much.  We also happened to leave a pair of shoes at our hotel around the corner so we had to come back to downtown Knoxville around lunch time on our journey home from Florida and Stock and Barrel was open! The burgers were amazing, cooked perfectly as were the duck confit fries.  Since we were driving we didn't get to have a beer or bourbon but... that led us to the shakes which were unbelievably good.  Service was perfect!! Can't wait to get back to Knoxville!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,William H.,"Knoxville, TN",2/10/2016,5.0,"This place has some of the best burgers I have ever had.  Since the restaurant seems to always be packed, you have to be prepared for a wait to get in, but we have always found the food to be well worth the wait.  The noise level is a little loud inside but we still find this a fun place to eat.  The burgers are so large that we almost always have food to take home with us.  Definitely a great restaurant on Market Square!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Keith M.,"Lexington, KY",7/6/2014,4.0,Duck confit fries are so flavorful a must upgrade. Absolutely loved the hurt locked a burger with pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes. All the bourbon could ask for. The only negative was the service and size The size stinks just because it makes the wait tremendously long 2hrs.  Our server was kinda thorough but  made us feel like we were a bother to his evening. I would go again but prob get it to go.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Brandi S.,"San Antonio, TX",9/7/2015,5.0,"My mom, dad and I came here out of the blue looking to try something new in Knoxville, which we all know is hard to find.  I stumbled across this restaurant on a few different sites and convinced them to try it out. Now, the three of us consider ourselves some pretty rough critics and some real foodies, and WOW. These burgers are seriously good y'all. So mom and I shared the one with pimento cheese and a fried green tomato (forgot what it's called, sorry) and dad got the all American or something (typical), bacon, cheese, bourbon onions, and so on. And then we got onion rings and Mac and cheese, and let me tell you BOTH were delish. And again, we are all very picky. And then of course we had to try milkshakes right?? So I got the Nutella, I mean come on.... And dad got the s'mores, so we ALL voted mine was the winner. Both were good but the s'mores didn't have much of a s'more flavor to me and I love s'mores, pro Girl Scout right here. So Nutella milkshake has my vote. Anyways, long review short, try this place out. It is freaking delish. But... It is very small and narrow so get there early or else the wait creeps up and you will regret it!annndddd you are welcome."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Allen M.,"Kingston Springs, TN",7/26/2015,5.0,"My only regret with this place is that it needs to be larger to accommodate the amount of people waiting to get in.  But that is the best sign of a good restaurant.  Used the ""NoWait"" app to get my name in and on arrival I still had a bit of a wait, but it was worth it.  The food and drinks were excellent and our waiter may have provided the best wait experience I have ever had at any restaurant.  I wish they would open one of these in Nashville.  Now my favorite restaurant in Knoxville, I will be back."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,kelsey y.,"San Marcos, TX",7/13/2015,5.0,"Visiting Knoxville for the weekend and decided to give Stock and Barrel a go based on reviews...it was delicious! Our server was very knowledgeable about the different bourbons and made great recommendations.I chose the ""Bernie"" (again recommended by the server) and it was by far, the best burger that I have ever had!!! Sweet, savory, salty, and perfect! If you are a fan of blue cheese and jalapeños...just do it...you will not be disappointed!Hubby had the ""Hurt Locker"". It was good. Not nearly as flavorful as the ""Bernie"". We both agreed that we will attempt to recreate the ""Bernie"" when we get home.Onion rings were lightly battered and perfect. Duck confit fries were good. I guess that I was expecting something insanely awesome after reading the reviews...just keeping it real. I would choose them again but they weren't that much different than the french fries that come with your burger at no additional charge. The sauce that comes with them is basically yum yum sauce, like you get at a Japanese restaurant. We would eat here again for sure!!! I would recommend it to anyone that loves a great burger!!! Cool atmosphere, great food, great drinks, and very attentive service."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jackie R.,"Williamsburg, VA",5/27/2015,5.0,Burgers were amazing as were the fries. I had a black bean veggie burger- awesome. From the bar: I had an Old Fashioned which was beautifully made. Would have returned here multiple times if we were in town longer!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Cynthia K.,"Montgomery, TX",5/24/2015,5.0,"Easily the BEST burger I've ever had. I've traveled at least half of the U.S. And can't think of a better burger. Not greasy, not heavy, cooked perfectly. Delicious French fries and home made macaroni and cheese (sorry Blue box). If you plan on passing through or visiting, you have to try Stock and Barrel."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mike B.,"Knoxville, TN",9/19/2013,2.0,"What kind of high end burger restaurant doesn't ask how you want your burger cooked and then cooks it well done, dry and literally like a hockey puck. The restaurant smelled like mildew and the staff is not very friendly. For a $12 burger I would have expected more!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,L B.,"Knoxville, TN",5/16/2015,5.0,easily the best burgers in the city  - small scale seating and  excellent atmosphere = come early or expect a long wait -  but worth a long wait.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Peggy K.,"Knoxville, TN",9/3/2015,5.0,"Best burger in Knoxville, as well as the best selection of bourbon.  A unique experience."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Martín G.,"Sacramento, CA",4/20/2015,5.0,"The best burger I have ever had, and I am a burger fan. I had the Farmhouse Burger. Simply amazing! The selection of Whiskeys and Bourbon is superb. I am here for 4 days, and at least 2 of my dinners have been here... so far. Go and enjoy the best burger ever!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,John C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/6/2015,3.0,"Decent Burger, slow service... I may eat here again on a day when they don't have customers, but I wouldn't wait in line for it"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Carl J.,"Knoxville, TN",7/25/2015,4.0,Don't take your dates here. You won't get laid. Everyone just passes out full after dinner.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Allyn M.,"Knoxville, TN",7/16/2015,4.0,"Excellent burgers. Note that it is somewhat pricy for burgers, but worth it in my opinion. There can be a really, really long wait. We went on a Saturday (two adults and a kid) and had almost a two hour wait. Luckily they will text you when your table is ready so you can run off, but its still an investment."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Matthew A.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2015,5.0,"Excellent whiskies, burgers and service. My wife and I have been here several times (ok we happened to watch American Pharoah finish the triple crown while we were there). In addition, they have a great tomato salad, and our bartender was really fun and patient."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Chris S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/26/2015,2.0,"Not sure what all the hype is about, maybe it was just an off night. Veggie burger was mush and my burger was way undercooked and underwhelming."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Kim M.,"Chatsworth, GA",8/4/2014,4.0,We ate the best burger's I had the Elk burger which was wonderful. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars the server was ok but really did not have a personally. I think he was busy but still you can still be nice and act like you care about your job and your customers. We will be going back!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Annette H.,"Knoxville, TN",4/3/2015,5.0,Had a delicious burger once again.... Perfect as always... Put some tweeks on it to my liking and it was divine! Carmelized onions and tomato jam on the farmhouse!!!! Yum yum!!!! Service was impeccable by Rachel and we enjoy coming to such a great atmosphere.... We have never had a complaint and always exceeds expectations!!!! Best burgers in town!!!!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,kir h.,"Chicago, IL",3/16/2014,5.0,"delicious! i went two times, both on weekdays not during peak hours and the wait wasn't long. but i hear it can be a beast on the weekends.  it's delicious though! had the special bison burger and it was extremely juicy and flavorful. the duck contif french fries that were on the side were outstanding as well. great and attentive service."

Honestly at first I wasn't into the whole burger thing. Well was I wrong there.....it's a burger place, fine dining, casual bar ....with amazing food!! I had a salmon burger that well words just can not explain. Bieng able to sit outside and enjoy the entertainment in the street was cool too. Kudo's staff !!!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Karen S.,"Arlington, VA",4/9/2014,4.0,Had the chicken and waffle sandwich and just wow! So good! It is hard to find a place that gets the right chicken to waffle ratio but this one does it. Also really like sandwich aspect. The place is small so be prepared to wait if going during peak times.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jay R.,"Knoxville, TN",9/21/2014,5.0,Burger + whiskey joint. Has some beers on tap. Hip atmosphere that has rather limited seating. Best burger in town in my own personal opinion. Fries are great as well. Would recommend to my friends
farmacy-knoxville-2,Colleen R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/28/2022,5.0,"I am going to be able to make it through the rest of my work day because I'll be riding the high that was lunch at Farmacy.  Key to getting a table without a wait at lunch is to roll in there by 11:45 am, although i'd say the restaurant was probably 75% full even at that time. Farmacy could be the poster child for Southern farm to table cuisine and style.  The dining room is adorable, fresh, arty, a little quirky, and very cozy and comfortable.  Many menu items are locally sourced.  The offerings aren't fussy, and there aren't a million things to chose from which means what they serve, they prepare with care.Three of us all ordered the same thing: Thursday's special which was a Springer Mountain Chicken baked Enchilada with green salsa served with jalapeño pinto and black beans.   The beans had a perfect combo of sweet and heat, and it was wonderful diving into a plate of enchiladas that aren't drowning in a mystery sauce.  The chicken was tender and flavorful, cheese was hot and melty, and the tortillas were crisp and not a bit soggy.  As we walked out of Farmacy, my coworker remarked that this is a meal that is going to stick in her memory banks. We will definitely make a point of coming back on a Thursday again soon!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rebecca A.,"Knoxville, TN",7/26/2022,5.0,Amazing!  Thank you so much!  Atmosphere...excellent!Food...excellent!Thank you for making sure there was no cross contamination and offering GF options!  It is so hard to go out to eat and find places that actually have GF buns and then will continue to take care of their customers who are GF and celiac disease!  The food was superb!  I ate all of the sandwich...Minus the 2nd half of the bun which got a little soggy on the bottom ...which was no big deal!I can't wait to go back!!!They also were very accommodating with our seating.  We were seated in a noisy section and it was a little loud for me and they gladly moved us to a much quieter section...excellent!Our server was very knowledgeable of all things Gluten-free!Thank you!We will be Back!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Daryl J.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/19/2022,4.0,"First the restaurant is owned and primarily operated by women which is a huge plus and rarity. They were very welcoming and nice. We went during brunch/Father's Day  and the wait was only an hour. The chicken and waffles were a hit. Waffle were flavored and cooked perfectly. I recommend the bright side bowl or the cure all burger. Many of their food items are local.  The drink menu is HUGE. There is also LIVE music. This place definitely pass the vibes check. Reasons I don't give it 5 stars  1. No mixed coffee drinks period  such as a latte or cappuccino. 2. The parking was also  insane. I'd avoid later brunch hours and holiday next time. 3. Make note the brunch menu is strict and any modifications of brunch menu are limited or surcharge Overall, I highly recommend and will try again."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Micah D.,"Murfreesboro, TN",8/10/2022,5.0,"This wonderful local restaurant is the elevation of food that Knoxville needs! Walking in you are greeted by friendly smiles and beautiful decor. I couldn't get over the cute little details all around. Everyone who served us was very accommodating. The menu is full of tempting dishes. It was so hard to choose. I started with a blueberry mule. Delicious! The syrups are made in house! The seasonal burrata appetizer with ceviche shrimp was absolutely my favorite part of the meal. So many flavors that just combine perfectly. My main dish was the cure-all salmon sandwich. Huge piece of salmon beautifully seasoned with cured onion, avocado, and jalapeno aioli. It came with a plentiful side of fries. I wish I had room for dessert because the sweets menu looked so good. I will be back. Maybe Friday for the lobster rolls..."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rachyl D.,"Charleston, SC",7/22/2022,5.0,"We stopped here as a last minute lunch on our way out of town and I'm so glad we did! It was the best food we ate on our entire trip in Knoxville! The soup and the bowls were so good, and one person in our group said the potato salad was the best she ever had! A little out of the way but worth it!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Yvonne L.,"Washington, DC",7/14/2022,4.0,"Super cute brunch spot with high portion sizes. The vibe and decor is on point and the patio is really nice too. The chicken and waffles was tasty and the drinks were nice as well. Only thing that could be improved is service. It was a bit on the slow side. But all in all, good experience here!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lauren C.,"Dayton, OH",7/3/2022,5.0,"I'm a pharmacist and nutritionist myself so the name ""Farmacy"" definitely spoke to me! Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Made a reservation online through Google because it is usually packed. Our table of three sat in a the cute little circle booth. Food was amazing! So fresh and vibrant! I had the Empowered Bowl with arugula, sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, radishes, and chopped grilled salmon with the honey jalapeño vinaigrette. Definitely will come back if I'm in town again!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Sarah M.,"Memphis, TN",8/18/2022,4.0,Great brunch options - something on the menu for everyone! Great cocktails too - try the peach Bellini!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Gretel Y.,"Gilbert, AZ",2/7/2022,5.0,"My son and I were in town for a meet and stayed at a hotel nearby. We were only in town for a couple of days and wanted a really good brunch. Did a quick Yelp search and got excited when I saw how close Farmacy was!We arrived around 11:30 AM on a Saturday and were greeted immediately upon entering. The place was busy, but to our surprise, we were seated right away. Farmacy is a good example of ""don't judge a book by its cover."" The outside doesn't look like much. The space was bright and beautiful. Plenty of seating.It didn't take us long to decide on what to get:CoffeePeach teaBeignetsVitality bowl Avocado toastWe love to start (and/or end) with something sweet and the beignets fit the bill. One order came with three huge beignets generously covered in powdered sugar and a side of raspberry honey. They were wonderful! I chose the vitality bowl for me entree. It comes with corn, black beans, hash, avocado, tomato, feta, radish, red onion, sprouts, grilled chicken, and a fried egg on a bed of arugula. I asked for no chicken. Filling and flavorful. My son got the avocado toast. Came with thick cut Flourhead multigrain bread covered in smashed avocado, topped with thick cut tomato, lemon, cured onion, feta and radish. Served with a side of eggs. It was the most beautiful, vibrant avocado toast I have ever seen! Very tasty, too.We had an excellent meal and experience at Farmacy. Highly recommend!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Adriana F.,"Sparta Township, NJ",7/27/2022,4.0,"We came to Farmacy to have a celebratory dinner with our realtor after purchasing our first home. I right away loved the airy and vibrant ambiance of the main room. All of the rooms are adorned with pretty plants and are Instagram worthy. There is also an enclosed dining room for private parties/events. Our table of four split the cornbread appetizer, which comes out in this adorable cast iron dish and is served with finger-licking good honey butter. Needless to say, the cornbread was enjoyed in minutes by all of us, and I highly recommend it as something light to start with. For our entrees, my husband had the brisket plate and I had the maple pecan salmon. The brisket is from Painted Hills and is slow cooked for 12 hours. It literally melts in your mouth!! It's served with green beans and over smashed red potatoes with a side of their house tomato jam. When I tasted my husband's brisket, I almost wished I had ordered that instead of my salmon. My Chilean salmon with its sweet maple pecan glaze came with green beans and smashed sweet potatoes but was a little underwhelming. The salmon was cooked a little too long and was dried out when I went to taste it, whereas my green beans were entirely undercooked. That is the sole reason for one less star in my review. All in all, I would recommend Farmacy for their unique southern fare. I look forward to giving them another try and getting that mouthwatering Brisket Plate next time around."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Diep L.,"Houston, TX",7/30/2022,5.0,"Omg!! I love this place so much!! I went here Friday evening during their happy hour. They have things like $2 bubbles, $5 beer/wine, and $8 hot chicken which is HOT let me tell you. I got their blue fries and it was so good! Our waitress was sooooo nice! And their cocktail drinks were really amazing! I got the LA Ex and it was very botanical. Overall, I will 10000% be coming back. I saw that they had a lobster roll on the menu which I would like to try next time."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Brooke H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/31/2022,5.0,"Wonderful place for weekend brunch!  This place has cute modern farm house decor and the servers all wear black & white gingham to go with that vibe.  The brunch menu is pretty small but well round and filled with knock out items.  I ordered the Rise & Shine, which was delicious and unique with a combo of fried avocado, pimento cheese, and fried egg on a biscuit.  My husband had the churro waffles, which is the item that tempted us to make the drive from Maryville for brunch, and he raved about it, especially the banana pudding whipped cream topping.  Our kids weren't feeling breakfast but luckily the lunch / dinner items were available from the kids menu so they enjoyed chicken tenders and a cheeseburger.  Service was great, even though the place was busy.  They also had live music near the bar.  There was a wait the entire time we were there, so next time I'll be sure to grab a reservation ahead of time."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kimberly G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",7/13/2022,3.0,The food was good but at 10am it would be nice to have some breakfast options. This place is extremely pricey for what you get. The bread pudding was terrific.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Adrienne S.,"Raleigh, NC",8/28/2022,3.0,"Food was great. The reasons behind my 3 star rating are:1. Waiter was waiting tables and the bar so he wasn't as attentive as he could have been. By the time we got our appetizer, our entree came out within the next minute. It was a Saturday night so maybe they had some employees call out.. idk.2. He didn't write our order down which caused for several mistakes. To include putting pork on a dish (we don't eat pork) and forgetting a few things we wanted to add or take off.I will come back because the food was good."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Carolyn N.,"NC, NC",9/9/2022,5.0,"Incredible food. Amazing drinks. Amazing ambiance. Honestly can't say enough about this place. Went for brunch, and the breakfast burrito was insane. Can't wait to go back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Alexandria M.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",6/12/2022,5.0,"BEST BRUNCH IN TOWN! We've tried all the top places around here and back home in FL and this one is by far the tastiest, kindest and best cost for this food. Chicken and waffles are great, best juiciest chicken I've probably ever had. Mimosas are great, salad is SO fresh and tasty. The breakfast burger we got was very tasty but not as breakfasty as we thought but it's a burger so that's probably on us. Definitely a 10/10 and will be taking all of our visitors that come visit!"

This place is tastebuds heaven and the if you are like me you will definitely feel warm inside because of the amazing service you get, it's such a rare things these days to have good food and good service, this definitely restored my faith in humanity.

farmacy-knoxville-2,Lisa H.,"Jackson, TN",8/14/2022,5.0,"Ummmmm, yum!  No brainer.  Left trying to figure out how I could have eaten that last bit of the churro waffles that were so crazily delicious and should not go to waste. Every time I drive by Farmacy when we visit Knoxville, I am like Pavlov's dog and start drooling without even needing a bell.  Almost opted not to post a rave review because I don't like to fight crowds for food."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ginny M.,"Brentwood, TN",2/21/2022,5.0,"We visited for the first time during lunch and absolutely loved the farm to table atmosphere, recipes and originality. We had the Brussels for our appetizer and they were in the top 2 Brussels dishes I've ever had! They were nice and crispy with great flavor atop a layer of pepper jelly (which I asked for more of!) and topped with diced pear. Very different and we didn't leave a bite haha. My friends got the french dip and hot chicken dishes and really enjoyed them. Since I had so much of the appetizer, I went with the wedge salad and it was fantastic. It was very large so I could only handle about half of it, just fyi! Can't complain because of a large portion, but good info to have. The bacon crumbles were maple/sweet and complimented their buttermilk ranch and balsamic drizzle nicely. I love a wedge with a twist and this was delicious! We will be back for sure next time we're in the area!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ninad O.,"Memphis, TN",8/3/2021,3.0,"We stopped by at this place on our way to Gatlinburg from Memphis. It was a perfect stop-over place for us. I ordered their Southern fried tofu burger. The burgers were good but not great. The tofu itself was quite greasy, we had to dab it thoroughly on a napkin before eating. Overall, the flavors were not very complex. Service was good. We were also disappointed by the fairly limited options on the menu, especially for vegetarian people in the group. We liked their modern chic interiors with all precautions for covid distancing."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kimberly G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",7/13/2022,3.0,The food was good but at 10am it would be nice to have some breakfast options. This place is extremely pricey for what you get. The bread pudding was terrific.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jacob H.,"KIMBERLIN HGT, TN",7/9/2022,3.0,"A bit pricey for what you get. Mainly a brunch spot, and the quality of food is good, but it lacks in value and portion size. I would go here again, especially if I were getting morning drinks with friends, but nothing that leaves me eager to rush back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lauren C.,"Dayton, OH",7/3/2022,5.0,"I'm a pharmacist and nutritionist myself so the name ""Farmacy"" definitely spoke to me! Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Made a reservation online through Google because it is usually packed. Our table of three sat in a the cute little circle booth. Food was amazing! So fresh and vibrant! I had the Empowered Bowl with arugula, sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, radishes, and chopped grilled salmon with the honey jalapeño vinaigrette. Definitely will come back if I'm in town again!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Marianne D.,"Knoxville, TN",6/28/2022,4.0,"The food and the service were exemplary! The outdoor patio was dirty (spider webs with debris in them), and some bird nest material blew down onto our table from the patio rafters and got in a cup of coffee. I spoke with the manager about it. We'll visit again for sure but sit inside."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Daryl J.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/19/2022,4.0,"First the restaurant is owned and primarily operated by women which is a huge plus and rarity. They were very welcoming and nice. We went during brunch/Father's Day  and the wait was only an hour. The chicken and waffles were a hit. Waffle were flavored and cooked perfectly. I recommend the bright side bowl or the cure all burger. Many of their food items are local.  The drink menu is HUGE. There is also LIVE music. This place definitely pass the vibes check. Reasons I don't give it 5 stars  1. No mixed coffee drinks period  such as a latte or cappuccino. 2. The parking was also  insane. I'd avoid later brunch hours and holiday next time. 3. Make note the brunch menu is strict and any modifications of brunch menu are limited or surcharge Overall, I highly recommend and will try again."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Janet B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/16/2022,5.0,"Highly recommend the brussel sprouts, wedge salad and the strawberry short cake! Everything was super fresh!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Alexandria M.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",6/12/2022,5.0,"BEST BRUNCH IN TOWN! We've tried all the top places around here and back home in FL and this one is by far the tastiest, kindest and best cost for this food. Chicken and waffles are great, best juiciest chicken I've probably ever had. Mimosas are great, salad is SO fresh and tasty. The breakfast burger we got was very tasty but not as breakfasty as we thought but it's a burger so that's probably on us. Definitely a 10/10 and will be taking all of our visitors that come visit!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Sam M.,"Riverside, CA",6/4/2022,5.0,"A group of 8 of us drove in from Chattanooga for an art event and ate at the Farmacy for dinner. Each of us got something different and no one was disappointed.  Nice proportions, flavorful, interesting  and well prepared. Our server, Lilia, was personable and efficient. We will return."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Scott D.,"Knoxville, TN",6/3/2022,1.0,"Do not waste your time, money or expectations on this establishment... We stopped in for a quick bite on a Thursday at 5:20pm because we missed lunch and were starving. The restaurant was not busy at all and they seated us at a table as far in the back as you could go in this hot, stuffy concrete floored room. We waited 9 minutes for someone to ask if we wanted water, another 11 minutes  for someone to ask if we wanted appetizers. We went ahead and ordered drinks and food while we had their attention and hoped things would get better. Well they didn't... almost 8 minutes later the waiter sat down a highball glass filled with some syrupy red liquid and said it was a ""raspberry Cosmopolitan"". Let's just say it didn't look like any Cosmo I'd ever seen and he also said ""they cannot substitute a liquor brand in their signature drinks""  (my order) but he never brought it. Rather than prolong the agony, we left and will never go back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,J C.,"TN, TN",5/29/2022,5.0,Excellent food and ingredients. I love everything that I've tried on the menu. Great drinks as well
farmacy-knoxville-2,J C.,"TN, TN",3/31/2022,5.0,"Everything that I've tried on the menu is delicious. Fresh ingredients and excellent drinks as well. The Brussel sprouts & the Vitality Bowl are my favorites, but if you're coming for brunch, the breakfast bowl is fantastic as well"
farmacy-knoxville-2,J C.,"TN, TN",11/30/2021,5.0,These are the best Brussel sprouts that I have ever tried. All the items on the menu that I have tried are fresh and delicious.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Katie N.,"Mount Hope, KS",8/7/2022,5.0,Food is always delicious!!! 10/10 recommend. The maple pecan salmon is wonderful. The flavors combine well. I love that they work with local farmers to buy their products. Great local restaurant!
farmacy-knoxville-2,J H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/28/2022,5.0,"It so good, we ordered a French dip, salmon, w fries and macaroni cheese sides. Then had dessert because the food is so good you know the desserts w be too :)"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Erin T.,"Westminster, CO",4/21/2022,5.0,We checked this place out on a trip visiting from Colorado. We had been here a while already and I think I've eaten enough fried chicken & bbq to last me a lifetime so we were looking for something light & fresh for lunch and this place was great. It definitely hit the spot and everything was incredibly fresh and delicious.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jill B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/5/2021,3.0,"My husband got a gift card from a client for Farmacy.  We heard really great things and headed over.  We sat outside and I ordered the salmon.  My kids got the chicken tenders to split and my husband got shrimp and grits.  My kids are most of their chicken tenders and fries.  The fries were good.  The broccoli was good and the salmon was okay.  I am not a big barley fan and that was what the salmon was plated with.  The shrimp and grits were a little spicy and the sauce was kind of thick for me.  Overall the food was 3 for me.  Service was fine and we were seated quickly outside and let in through the gate outside so we didn't even have to walk through the rest.I would go back if my husband wanted to and be able to get something decent but for me personally, it would not be my top choice for the cost."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Alexandra S.,"Asheville, NC",4/23/2022,5.0,"I'm from out of town and found Farmacy when searching for vegetarian food in KNX. As soon as I saw the black and blue fries on the menu I was sold. We had our dog with us and there was plenty of outdoor seating. It was a Sunday evening and after waiting for a short period we were seated. The B&B fries were the best thing ever. The buffalo sauce we sweet but spicy, and they used just the right amount, which was enough to be on every bite but not drenched. There was a generous amount of blue cheese crumbles, and the fries were crispy yet soft and seemed to be hand cut. My partner and I split the tofu sandwich, green beans, a side of the Mac n cheese, and a biscuit. The Mac and cheese was so good, and was made with penne. The biscuit was served with a whipped sweet butter that was good enough to eat with a spoon. I would come back over and over again just for the fry appetizer and the Mac n cheese, but everything we ate was amazing and the staff was efficient and friendly."

farmacy-knoxville-2,Sarah T.,"Harrison, AR",5/16/2022,5.0,We went for Sunday Brunch & the service was great! Our server was attentive & helpful & the food was SOOOO good. He also gave us suggestions of what to try (as we had never been here before) and everything was so good!

farmacy-knoxville-2,George L.,"Knoxville, TN",3/11/2022,4.0,The taco special on Tuesday is great. The Brussels sprouts I have had there for appetizer were very unlike any roasted Brussel sprouts I have had before also the wings were very good. I had the brisket plate and that was ok it was some what dry not the best brisket have I have had. Portions are a tad small. The breakfast I have had there was good nothing really stood out for the brunch menu and the blood Mary was very watered down
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rebecca P.,"Clemson, SC",7/19/2022,5.0,Super food and service makes eating out there a joy. Mixologist does a great job also.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Keegan H.,"Killeen, TX",5/21/2022,4.0,"I find it hard to rate this place because it's hard to categorize. It's not quite a brunch/cafe but not quite a scratch kitchen-- it's a little both. I was pleasantly surprised by the short yet diverse selection of menu items. We had the black and blue fries, cure-all sandwich, and Nashville hot chicken with chipotle Mac on the side. Weston was calm and knowledgeable and had great service. We'll definitely be back to try something else! Nice light atmosphere and not much of a wait makes it an easy choice to throw in your rotation! Rating 8.6/10."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Alix Sofie A.,"San Clemente, CA",7/31/2021,5.0,"Stopped by for brunch and ordered The Sunny and The Bright Side. The Sunny was awesome! Tasty with a good balance of flavors. Loved the pickled onions and the radishes. The Bright Side's sweet potatoes complimented the smokiness of the black beans. The eggs were perfect--not over cooked like most restaurants. Avocado could have used more flavor, but overall delicious bowl; would get again. Recommend getting hot sauce on the side, as it's flavor can overpower the bowl. When you go, ask for Lilia! Best server we've ever had"
farmacy-knoxville-2,AJ S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/20/2021,1.0,"Ambience looks nice and very welcoming, our hostess was very accommodating and even suggested us what to order as we are vegetarian, our main reason to make a trip was to try avocado toast as someone had posted about it but it was not clearly mentioned that it is only available on weekends. Our hostess even requested the kitchen for a special order but it was the end of the shift so that was very disappointing. Ordered a vitality bowl with tofu instead of the chicken and egg. When it came out there was tofu with an egg sitting on it. So the waitress just took out the egg and just what it touched and gave us the bowl! We just walked out without eating anything. If you cater to vegetarians and vegans please understand that we don't eat food that is contaminated by chicken and eggs! Taking it out doesn't make it right. No pictures to post as we never ate anything."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lynn C.,"TN, TN",1/15/2022,4.0,"The flavors were excellent. Tomato soup was absolutely delicious. Burrata app was delicious with poached pear, squash, arugula and pistachio. Highly recommend the gnocchi dish, the flavors were just divine and it was some of the best, fresh gnocchi I've ever had.  The maple pecan salmon was also delicious, very moist, but I asked to have it rare and it definitely wasn't, no biggie, but still.  My sister got the wedge salad and it came out with very little dressing and very little blue cheese, Iceberg lettuce needs flavor!! The waitress was more than happy to bring us extra blue cheese and extra dressing which made it. I don't remember the name of the cocktails but I had something with lavender infused vodka and I have to say it was a genius cocktail. Our server was very sweet as well as the bartender.  I do wish they had specials and I do wish they had martinis, but all in all it was a very good choice."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Michelle B.,"Suwanee, GA",1/31/2022,5.0,"Super cute, wonderful service and delicious food. Just what I want when I go out. My daughter and I each chose one of their bowls. Both were fabulous. Saved room for dessert and enjoyed the skillet cookie. Delish!  Will be back!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Julie W.,"Cincinnati, OH",6/11/2021,5.0,Stopped for lunch and was glad I did! The food is very fresh.  Had the Southernaire Salad. Great blend of flavors.  The name was explained to us that it is to remind us that food should be healthy - like 'medicine' for nourishment and of its play on words with farm to table.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ramón A.,"Austin, TX",6/2/2021,5.0,"The front of the house deserves a ton of praise - and this is with the back of the house executing perfectly on our food.Brunch crowds are typically stressful to navigate but the whole time what stood out to me was how well they managed flow. Sure, my party had to wait because we didn't have a reservation but it never felt like we were forgotten and there were plenty of things to do while we wait."
farmacy-knoxville-2,JBrown T.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/26/2021,4.0,The customer service is outstanding and the food is absolutely amazing. For the appetizer I normally go with the Brussel sprout and as a meal I go with the pecan glazed salmon or Nashville hot Chicken.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ceri F.,"Knoxville, TN",5/17/2021,3.0,"I love the The atmosphere at Farmacy. I just wish I loved the food. There is nothing that I have had that makes it a stand out restaurant to me. I got the basic scrambled eggs, bacon and hash. Scrambled eggs were not seasoned at all. The hash was sweet potatoes with sautéed onions so it was sweet on sweet with no crunch. I was left searching for crunch or some acid. The teeny tiny salad with watermelon radish was delicious. The biscuit was also delicious. My husband has the breakfast burrito. While it was delicious, that filling was a little bit too large for our liking. So instead of getting a bite with a nice mix of ingredients you were left with a bite full of solid sausage. Though they put some cheese down in the pan and toasted it onto the exterior of the burrito, That was pretty spectacular! But again with the hash being sweet on sweet we were left wanting.The atmosphere and service was top notch!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rachel M.,"Denver, CO",5/9/2021,4.0,"Cute little brunch spot in Kingston pike. Used to visit the old location and was excited that they are back open in their new and much larger spot!  Biggest location issue is the lack of parking.  Food, as always, was good. We started off with the beignets and ordered two orders for the 4 of us. The amount was perfect. We had a wide variety of food. Avocado toast (was ok, nothing special) the breakfast burrito which had fried cheese on the top, a burger and the salmon sandwich.  Portions were large and filling and overall the meal was satisfactory.Service was, meh. The girl that greeted us was a bit rude and our server was very slow to check on us. Usually have a good experience (hence the 4 stars) so hoping it was just a one off day."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kimbra K.,"Delray Beach, FL",11/21/2021,5.0,"This isn't the type of food that I enjoy, being a vegetarian. But, it is the type of place that my family LOVED. It is down home, country cooking with no appearance of it having been sent in frozen, as so many restaurants do these days. My mom was crazy about the chicken bowl. The vibe was great, very relaxed and upbeat. The service was great. I'd take my family back here any time. It would be great if they cut weirdo eaters, like me, a break and had better vegan options. But, for people who like to eat like their southern grandma and aunts cooked for them....this is the place."

farmacy-knoxville-2,Jack K.,"Fort Sanders, Knoxville, TN",3/27/2021,2.0,"Came for brunch and was a little bit confused on the vibe they were going for. Mix of upscale and casual decor, menu items, and service (Host staff dressed formally in all black but waiter was wearing jeans and a flannel). Small menu for brunch... Only a couple of sandwich options, the problem was they were only serving off brunch menu. Lunch menu wasn't being offered.They offer Nashville Hot Chicken and Hot Chicken and Waffles... do yourself a favor and DO NOT ORDER THIS. Instead of the smooth cayenne heat accompanied by brown sugar sweetness you'd expect from from Nashville Hot Chicken, you get a strange soupy asian habanero sauce that ruins the breading on the chicken, as well as the waffles.Someone else in my party was disappointed with the ""Good Ole Boy"" Sandwich (their take on a french dip).Maybe we just ordered wrong?Glad we tried it but won't be back anytime soon. 2.3 out of 5."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Paul C.,"Clifton, VA",4/9/2021,3.0,"Driving back from Nashville, my family and I decided to take a chance at this restaurant.It was near the highway and the area was nice. The setting was new, the social distancing was great and the food was fresh. I would give it 4 stars for the food and service but the hostess made me take off one for her service. We got there and she took our temperatures along with another family that came after us and decided to sit them first. I guess they seat people that come in last first? Not sure what happened but we didn't have to wait so she sat us in a table separated by wooden doors from the table next to us.The waitress was nice and friendly, we had to scan the menu from the table and decided to order from the brunch menu as that was the only menu they were using. I got the Dave's eggs with coffee which was good and fresh but felt the dish needed more seasoning, spice or some type of condiment. Overall it was good and if we are ever headed down south, we may stop again to try a different menu."
farmacy-knoxville-2,J C.,"TN, TN",5/29/2022,5.0,Excellent food and ingredients. I love everything that I've tried on the menu. Great drinks as well

farmacy-knoxville-2,Caitlin P.,"Kingsport, TN",11/16/2021,5.0,The cutest little restaurant ever!!! The decor (Aka the eat your heart out sign and the lemon wall were so cute)!! We came for brunch and I will def be back for dinner!! Mimosa prices were good and they had a lot of juice flavors to choose from which I liked a lot. We started with the beignets and omg so fluffy and the sauce was the perfect!! I got the churro waffles and they were literally amazing. They had banana pudding and caramel sauce on top. So sweet but def so good! I also tried some of the biscuits and gravy and the chicken was so good as well as the gravy! Make a reservation however because the wait may be long but totally worth it!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Denine Z.,"Greenwood, SC",10/20/2021,5.0,"Loved this small farm to table in Knoxville. Staff great. Good beer, wine and cocktail list I had delicious grilled chicken tacos (3) with pico, sauce, crumbled cotilla cheese and micro greens. Hubby had a Bowl. Everything was so fresh and locally sourced. You could tell the owners cared about quality. Highly recommend."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Synnove G.,"Knoxville, TN",1/20/2022,5.0,One of our favorite places for dinner and brunch! We eat here at least twice a month if not more! Wonderful service and delicious food!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Synnove G.,"Knoxville, TN",3/16/2021,5.0,Great spot for dining in and take out. Delicious food! Very good Covid protocols as well.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Iva C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2021,5.0,"This place exceeded my expectations! I dined here for the first time last night and it was wonderful. Although there is no longer a mask mandate, they have chosen to still require masks. They make it very clear from the moment you walk in. It makes me feel good to know they're still taking health measures seriously and want to keep everyone as safe as possible. All staff members were properly masked and everyone was so friendly. We had a hard time choosing what to order because the menu has a great variety of options! My family and I decided on The Cure-All sandwich, strawberry pecan salad, and the most delicious pasta dish with a green sauce. Everything was fantastic and the presentation was perfect. Our waitress was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. It was the most enjoyable meal. I can't wait to return!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jan A.,"Rockford, TN",9/5/2021,5.0,"The food is amazing!!! High quality farm to table with interesting flavor profiles.  The atmosphere is gorgeous!  The Brussels are some of the best I've ever had.  The vitality bowl is delicious!!! They make everything including sauces and dressings homemade, the honey habanero dressing is the best ever!  Cocktails are creative, although pricey, wine selection is thoughtful and vast. Definitely a must try local Knoxville spot!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jared M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/26/2021,5.0,"This is one of our top brunch spots in Knoxville. Their new location has much more seating than their previous location, which is really nice.  I'm also a fan of the Bearden area location more than the previous as well. I love the churro waffles!  We also love the Vitality salad bowl, it's so fresh!  We are thinking of making this an every weekend tradition!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Cody C.,"Powell, TN",4/9/2021,4.0,Really cool vibe and great menu! The staff was super friendly and professional.  Definitely a great spot for lunch or for a fun dinner date.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Amanda W.,"Naperville, IL",7/20/2021,3.0,"Food was pretty good, as was the server. The decor was adorable and inviting- much larger space than I expected being in a strip mall. Prices were pretty normal, but we went on ""taco Tuesday"" for $3 tacos and $5 margaritas. Tacos were ""trendy""- more like an arugula salad in a taco shell, but it's in Bearden so that's understandable. Everything about this dinner was very mediocre, and nothing about this experience stood out as a place I'd want to go to again."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jennifer A.,"Southlake, TX",8/17/2021,5.0,"We have been on a couple of occasions. The food is always fresh. Happen to be there on taco night, great deal and great food. Loved the spicy margarita."

farmacy-knoxville-2,Ella Kate M.,"TN, TN",4/6/2022,5.0,I really love this place it is very aesthetic pleasing it is in downtown and they have some of the best treats I've ever had I love this place I definitely recommend
farmacy-knoxville-2,Carolan K.,"Raynham, MA",11/19/2021,5.0,There is not a bad thing about this place. From the food to the service and decor everything was more than excellent. I took a shot in the dark and went for the gnocchi and it is by far the best gnocchi I've ever had. The waitress recommended adding chicken to the gnocchi which was perfect. If you get the hot chicken sandwich get the sauce on the side it is very very spicy.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Anonymous R.,"Tennessee City, TN",10/15/2021,5.0,"The Brussel sprout appetizer was not only beautifully presented but absolutely delicious. The restaurant is adorable, clean, and has this really fun aesthetic. Unfortunately we only stopped in to snack and so I only had the chance to try a starter and dessert, but I don't doubt the other menu items must be fantastic. Absolutely recommend the brussel sprouts; I'll be excited to try the other desserts! Overall, this place is so cute, and so worth a visit."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Mary T.,"Knoxville, TN",1/4/2020,5.0,"I absolutely love this place.  It's cute, it's small, it's cozy, it's homey. I just love it.  I usually go for lunch or brunch.  I seem to sneak in at the exact right time not sure how I do it, but whatever it is I'm having some luck. The crowd normally pours in after me.  Lucky me.I love their breakfast options and their biscuits are some of the best in Knoxville!  On their Brunch Menu, I've tried Dave Egg's, Beignets, Rise n Shine, Chicken Tinga, and the Bright Side Bowl. Everything has been delicious but like I said make sure you try one of the biscuits here, you won't be disappointed.   I want to try the Churro Waffles so that may be my next choice for brunch.  I haven't ventured much off of the brunch menu besides the Vitality Bowl which is delicious!So if you are in the area and looking for a good breakfast stop here and check it out.  You order up front then go find a table, they come find you with your food when it's ready.  They have local Honeybee Coffee along w/ an assortment of jams & jellies.  They have a coffee station near the front which should have all you need to fix your coffee up however you may like it. In the warmer weather days they have a couple of patio tables but everything is first come first serve, oh and if you want wine, just run across the street to the liquor store and grab a bottle, as you can bring your own wine in here!! Hope you enjoy this little place as much as I do!!  Cheers & Enjoy!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Reggie W.,"Indian Trail, NC",7/11/2021,5.0,"Had brunch today and it was awesome. So good. Service was great, menu had lots of options - all local and organic. I had ""The Sunny"" which was avocado toast, tomato, sprouts, and two sunny side up eggs. So good!The one criticism - the candied bacon on the biscuits and gravy was a little strange, but the remainder of the dish was great.Would absolutely recommend for brunch.Note - Apple Maps can't find this place, so keep your eyes open when going!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Danielle O.,"Lawrenceville, GA",6/19/2021,5.0,I had the best salmon of my life!! My only regret is that I didn't find them in time to enjoy their amazing brunch menu.  We will return every time we get the chance to visit Knoxville!!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Whitney S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/26/2022,5.0,Love the new location in Bearden. Food is consistently great and atmosphere is upbeat and maybe a little quirky. The vitality bowl is my go-to. But don't leave brunch without a biscuit!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Janet B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/16/2022,5.0,"Highly recommend the brussel sprouts, wedge salad and the strawberry short cake! Everything was super fresh!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Manuela P.,"Knoxville, TN",1/18/2021,5.0,"Love love love!  Our first visit in the new location!  So fresh in decor and food!  Service from Carson was terrific.  Had the pleasure to meet the co-owner Mackenzie as well.  It is clear she has been blessed with the team and new location.    Now for the food?  I had the yummy Roasted Brussel Sprouts appetizer that had bacon & small apple pieces , they were so kind to not include the Pepper Jelly (allergic) and gave me a side of their homemade Ranch dressing.  Then I fully enjoyed the Strawberry Salad that was loaded with praline pecans, feta , strawberries etc.  I added a slice of salmon, done to my request perfectly! Oh also the Strawberry salad dressing made me yearn for summer time.   My singing sister had the Roast beef sandwich with their great fresh fries, I have no picture of her's as she devoured her amazing tasty dish.   And lastly  there was a shared slice (HUGE) of their signature Strawberry Cake.    Can't wait to go back!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Mike J.,"TN, TN",4/24/2022,1.0,This place is garbage. The the portions are child size. They are not going to make the customer first or correct. If your not local white and wearing khakis and a polo your going to be treated less than.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Anna J.,"San Francisco, CA",9/15/2021,3.0,"Update: this place is definitely better for brunch. Went here for dinner and the food was not that good. Taco shells were hard- not like they meant to, rather like they were stale and rubbery. Shrimp had the black vein on the back. Cocktail was great and service was excellent. The biggest downside was how early they start shutting down. At 7:45 pm one employee wheeled a large mop bucket through the restaurant while many people were still eating. It wouldn't have been a big deal except that the smell was overwhelming. Think super strong chemical smell... very gross. Smell continued until the end of the meal. Bad enough that I won't return for dinner."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Anna J.,"San Francisco, CA",3/21/2021,4.0,"I tried this place for the first time after the move to Bearden. Went for brunch- COVID restrictions in place and seemed to be meticulously followed. The coffee came quickly and they were not skimpy on the cream which was nice. Brussels sprouts to start were delicious, albeit a bit oily so I could not eat that many. I had the good ole boy sandwich which was basically a French dip. It was good, but the horseradish sauce could have used some salt and was served on the side, but I would have preferred it on the sandwich. Fries were great. Our server was nice and attentive, but did not know the menu very well. For example, when we asked how the Brussels sprouts were cooked she had to go ask. We were also brought the wrong dish meant for another table at one point, and our starter and dirty plates weren't cleared before our main course. Since our table was small, we had to help our server pick up the dishes so she had a place to put the main dishes. A few small changes and I think the dining experience could be top notch. All in all a good experience, and I will be back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,KLeigh W.,"Destin, FL",3/15/2022,5.0,This place is so cute!! The food is great and the service was fantastic. We had the strawberry pecan salad with chicken and the hot chicken as well. It definitely has a kick!
farmacy-knoxville-2,danya j.,"Austin, TX",3/2/2022,2.0,"It is somewhat overpriced, tried it once and decided to give it another try  because it had a somewhat homey and neighborhood eatery vibe. Went for lunch during week.  When we walked in, we were asked if we had a reservation?  ..on a Tues for lunch??  We thought she was kidding, (because the place wasn't even full) but obviously not because we got a very 'snarky' look and she walked off when we chuckled!  We left...and I won't be back.I liked them better on the first try.    Was willing to pay a little extra, but now -   Think they are trying too hard to project  'fine dining snobbery',  and it just isn't all that."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Heidi M.,"Nashville, TN",12/7/2021,5.0,We really enjoyed Farmacy. My husband had the French dip and I had the salmon sandwich. Both were delicious. The service was also excellent.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ally C.,"Saint Charles, MO",2/25/2022,5.0,Absolutely the best salad/bowl of my life- ordered vitality bowl and it was so good with fresh ingredients! The lemon vinegar dressing was a good combo! Chris my waiter was so kind and efficient! Love this place- definitely coming back!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jenn W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/4/2021,5.0,"My husband and I had dinner here recently, and it was really good!  It was our first time eating here, and we'd heard great things from friends through the years.  I had the Enlightened Bowl.  It was filling but not too heavy.  I loved the combination of salmon and avocados!  My husband had the Farmacy Burger, and he was really happy with it.  It felt like more of a lunch place than dinner, but we'll definitely be back.  They're doing a great job with Covid precautions as well!!!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Bobbie P.,"Springfield, IL",1/1/2022,5.0,This little gem is one of the best restaurants I've eaten at. We were passing through and we're lucky enough to find this place. I highly encourage anyone to make a point to eat here if in the area. You will not be disappointed!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jason H.,"Cleveland, TN",1/30/2022,5.0,Great local restaurant!! All the food sounds amazing and has been!!!! Service was great too!! Awesome place!! Will keep on visiting
farmacy-knoxville-2,mi X.,"TN, TN",5/24/2022,3.0,"California artsy wannabe type vibes. looks cool, gives you high expectations on food but it's really just not that great especially for prices. I got the Farmacy Burger, really good first bites, cooked really well but the onions were just a mush. very unappetizing. fried chicken tacos are just okay, good creamy sauce. shrimp tacos- dry and salty, fairly tasty, but just dry and salty. brisket tacos were salty as well. Not that great for prices as well as the first time here"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Karen D.,"Maryville, TN",12/11/2021,5.0,Really cute place. The food is fantastic. We shared the Brussels and good ole boy sandwich. Awesome!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Tim P.,"TN, TN",9/19/2021,4.0,"Had a reservation for 5 on Friday night.  We weren't able to sit outside as requested. However, we were given a nice table in the middle of the restaurant. The service was good although the server seem stretched a little thin.  She was helpful in recommending choices from the menu.  We had a variety of appetizers and entrees.  Most were good to very good.  The lobster roll was good, but not as good as described.  The fries, however, were excellent.  The salmon was very nice.  The fried chicken tacos were a little dry, but still good.  The cornbread and Brussel sprouts appetizers were really good.  The best part of the meals was the strawberry shortcake.  Excellent!  The prices were very fair considering the quality of food and service we received.  With drinks and tip, the total for the 5 of us was $200.  I would return."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Dorit S.,"Waltham, MA",5/3/2019,4.0,"I decided to come here because I was looking for a brunch place with fresh ingredients. Walking in, the setup is a front area where you can browse the menu and order and then you seat yourself. The restaurant itself isn't huge so I could see how there would be trouble with seating when they get busier. My sister wanted to order eggs and toast but because they didn't have it on the menu they weren't able to serve her that meal. That was a little disappointing because it seemed like a straight forward thing to do. My breakfast was fresh and satisfying. You can tell the ingredients are quality. My sister ended up getting the beignets which were light and not too sweet. I would go again for sure"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Logan S.,"Powell, TN",5/9/2021,4.0,Food was excellent and the vibe was laid back! We will be back! Manager was very nice and helpful! The price was very reasonable.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Marti M.,"Chicago, IL",8/14/2021,4.0,"Sweet friendly staff, good for groups and family, kids etc. Bright and airy. Dishes are vibrant and delicious. Kids waffle and pancakes are a good size and very good! Big portions for smaller kids. No oat milk or cappuccinos.. regular coffee and milk/half and half only which was a bummer but that's no biggy. Just noteworthy."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Nicholas E.,"Creedmoor, TX",7/5/2021,2.0,"How can I begin to describe my thoughts about this experience?Farmhouse decor everywhere, the beautiful aroma of biscuits & butter, and a brunch menu that will take you back to childhood memories of gravy drenched biscuits, bacon, and sausage.My family and I discussed the brunch menu at length and decided what each of us would have, then we all told the waitress what we'd have an she told us... unfortunately at 11am on a Monday morning, they do not serve any kind of breakfast or brunch...We were bewildered for about 10 seconds.. ""uh, you mean nothing on this menu?""... she said no.2 other tables nearby began to mutter... one couple who just nearly sat down got up and walked out of the restaurant a couple of minutes later.. we could overhear them saying ""what kind of restaurant doesn't serve breakfast in the morning.. McDonald's serves breakfast in the morning"" lol.This was very disappointing to have to order lunch and dinner items at 11am. Although I will say, the food we ate was not terrible.Farmacy - rethink your opening times or rethink your menu strategy.Thanks for the experience."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jeanie L.,"Knoxville, TN",7/31/2021,5.0,"I love this place. My favorite is Vitality Bowl. The right mix of fresh ingredients. My daughter loved Mac & Cheese. It's a side dish but good enough to be served as a meal-heavenly creamy cheese. Most of all, servers are friendly and attentive. The interior is instagrammable! A great place!!!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Greg W.,"Knoxville, TN",9/5/2020,4.0,"Farmacy, who knew it was right around the corner from my home. Would love to try this place again when the dining room is open. We ordered take out. It was good but feel like the wait to get it home and unpacked kind of dampered the experience. I got the Farmacy burger and she got the bbq plate. The bbq held up fine but the burger with all that comes on it was just a mess. Everything tasted great, and I will give this another try once that dining room is open."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Saba S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/16/2020,5.0,"We wanted to support a local business during the safer-at-home measures, so we got takeout from Farmacy. Everything was great! My husband's favorite thing we ordered was the fried green tomatoes with goat cheese. I got the Vitality Bowl, which was a work of art! We decided to do pickup since the delivery fee was a bit pricier than some restaurants are currently charging. They have a very safe and easy process in place- just call when you arrive and they bring your order out to your car. Buy local during these difficult times and support our Knoxville small businesses!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Cory B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/14/2020,5.0,"We ordered takeout from here for Yelp's Big Night In because it is local and we had never tried their food.  We were not disappointed.  I tried the Farmacy burger and fries.  The burger was juicy, had lots of flavor, and fresh ingredients.  The fried green tomato on the burger was a very nice touch too.  The fries seemed to be freshly made steak fries, and they tasted great too.  My fiance had the pesto chicken sandwich with chips.  The chicken was breaded and seasoned well, and the bread was very good too.  The homemade chips I could have eaten a lot more of...so good!  I highly recommend the Farmacy as a great option for tasty local food"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Christina C.,"Fountain City, Knoxville, TN",2/7/2022,5.0,"Oh my god if you are looking for the best food in knoxville by golly you found it!!! You quite literally cannot go wrong with anything on the menu (and that goes for the drink menu as well!) We go at least once a week (sorry bank account) but it really is just that dang good. I cant speak highly enough of this place!! Girls night, date night, family meal, you name it, this restaurant is great for it all!!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ernesto D.,"Arlington, VA",7/20/2021,5.0,You will not regret coming here . . . unless you just don't like delicious food and drink! Perfect for a lunch group or dinner date.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Dan P.,"Lawrenceville, GA",7/16/2021,5.0,"Excellent food, great service, great brunch, excellent variety, not the same old brunch,all made from scratch and great service"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Casey J.,"Irving, TX",1/3/2021,5.0,"This place is awesome!  The coffee is wonderful, the spicy chicken n waffles is savory heat sweet, and the beignets, oh the beignets!  Avacado toast and churro waffles are seriously good as well.  Show up early or make a res bc the line will start stacking by 10am."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Leena N.,"Seattle, WA",1/10/2020,5.0,"I met some friends for lunch at Farmacy, and we all very much enjoyed our dining experience!We ordered a nice cross-section from the menu and shared everything family style.  The brisket tacos were outstanding, the salmon was excellent, and the fruit tea was very tasty.  The dish that stands out most in my memory was the chipotle mac n cheese; I'm going to make a point of ordering it again when I return :-)The staffers we met were all very help and friendly; our waitress gave us several spot-on recommendations, along with service that was totally on point while still remaining nonintrusive.If you haven't tried this place yet, you're missing out - highly recommended!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Miriam C.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",12/24/2019,4.0,"I think this place has potential to be 5 stars. My cousin and her family go here all the time and love it, but I'm visiting from out of town, so I only have this experience to rate. It's located in a strip mall with plenty of parking and the staff was very pleasant. The decor was warm and welcoming. Very cute. The building itself is very small. That could potentially be frustrating for anyone not wanting to be crammed next to someone when they are busy. We ended up ordering Togo after a long day at Dollywood. My cousin got the salmon sandwich with homemade chips and loved it. This is her go to. We both ordered their tomato and red pepper soup with goat cheese. This was phenomenal. I would come here for this alone again. I also got the farmacy burger. It was cooked perfectly, but had wayyyyy too much pepper. The flavors were an odd combination. The Fried green tomato was bland. I have had much better. The pimento cheese and bacon were yummy, but overall wished I had chosen something else. I would try again next time!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ralph E.,"Kodak, TN",8/28/2021,1.0,"Maybe , tried twice to eat there . Once , they only run a brunch menu in Sunday , not what we wanted at the time .Went back again , place was closed. Note on the door in mid week ."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Julie V.,"Jonesborough, TN",1/2/2022,1.0,"The ambiance was nice, and our server was great. However there were shells in the eggs, the whites were undercooked, the biscuit was burnt on top and the inside was raw. Aside from being improperly prepared, the food was also very underwhelming flavor wise. The lemon vinaigrette tasted like plain oil, and the pickled red onions were extremely salty. The Bloody Mary tasted like blended pico de Gallo. The sandwich I had was okay, but it was a really small portion for the price, and the horseradish was not very flavorful. I typically don't complain but my experience here was pretty bad. After paying almost $100 for brunch, I expected far better food and drinks."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jay W.,"Rockford, TN",4/29/2021,1.0,The food here is so overpriced for what you get. They're also extremely rude to customers and very extreme with face masks. There are a lot better restaurants out there that have great food at better prices and who are much more appreciative of their customers.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Noel D.,"Knoxville, TN",5/22/2021,5.0,"Excellent food, incredible service. Can't speak highly enough about this restaurant. Instantly became my new favorite brunch spot. If you haven't tried this place, do so."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Allyson H.,"Farragut, TN",1/18/2021,5.0,"My new found FAVORITE place for a HEALTHY fantastic lunch! The menu has a fun variety. I had the ""Enlightened Bowl"" a salad with salmon, avocado, sweet pickled onion arugula. Will come back with friends for sure!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Zach P.,"Kodak, TN",3/19/2019,3.0,"The method for ordering is a bit strange. You just order and go sit down. However when you walk in no one really tells you. So a bit more clarity wouldn't hurt for new guests. The seating is best towards the front. Dos: get the Vitality bowl-fresh interesting blend of ingredients, Avocado toast was looking really good. BBQ plate outside of the left out too long red skin mashed potatoes was all gravy. Donts: Sit mid to back of area, further back needs a fan or something to move stale air from the kitchen. Their biscuits are top notch. We actually had an employee take our order somewhat reluctantly but we tipped her and I'm sure that's what she there to do-dollar dollar bill y'all. Overall it was worth a try and if taking food to go for lunch- this is your place."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jerrod H.,"Knoxville, TN",11/18/2021,5.0,"Never disappointed when I eat here. The overall experience from service, atmosphere, and food are great. The French dip is one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. They also have amazing Mac and cheese. The menu changes seasonally but is always excellent. Brussel sprout starter is always good. A lot of downtown restaurants get most of the attention in Knoxville but the Farmacy is heads and shoulders above those places and is one of my wife and I's go to places. You will be glad you tried it!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kathy P.,"Knoxville, TN",2/26/2022,3.0,"Our first time here. Our waiter was friendly and quick.  We were thrilled with the appetizer of black and blue hand cut fries, they were delicious!  So we were expecting great things of the rest of the meal.  We ordered the ""special"" of bacon and bleu cheese ribeye that was not on the paper menu but was advertised online. The advertised ""thick grilled tomato"" on top was instead very thin and not grilled and did not have the bleu cheese or bacon.  The steak was tough and chewy and definitely not worth the price of $35.95, I'm sorry to say.  The acorn squash was very good!  The green beans were nothing special. The apple cobbler was just ok.  But we will give this restaurant another try, though!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Scott D.,"Knoxville, TN",6/3/2022,1.0,"Do not waste your time, money or expectations on this establishment... We stopped in for a quick bite on a Thursday at 5:20pm because we missed lunch and were starving. The restaurant was not busy at all and they seated us at a table as far in the back as you could go in this hot, stuffy concrete floored room. We waited 9 minutes for someone to ask if we wanted water, another 11 minutes  for someone to ask if we wanted appetizers. We went ahead and ordered drinks and food while we had their attention and hoped things would get better. Well they didn't... almost 8 minutes later the waiter sat down a highball glass filled with some syrupy red liquid and said it was a ""raspberry Cosmopolitan"". Let's just say it didn't look like any Cosmo I'd ever seen and he also said ""they cannot substitute a liquor brand in their signature drinks""  (my order) but he never brought it. Rather than prolong the agony, we left and will never go back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lela B.,"Evanston, IL",12/23/2021,5.0,"Amazing assortment of delicious, fresh foods. We loved the Brussels sprouts, tomato bisque, amazing cornbread, kale Caesar and maple glazed salmon. Very nicely decorated, spacious, good service. A perfect lunch stop between Asheville and Nashville!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Courtney M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",7/18/2021,5.0,"First time to Farmacy but definitely won't be the last! We brought some family members here for a weekday lunch, and had a delightful experience. The brussel sprouts and cornbread appetizer were delicious to start off before the main course. We tried the vitality bowl, hot chicken, burger, and chicken tacos. All were just as good as the appetizers and very good portions. The burger came out slightly undercooked and took some time to correct due to COVID precautions, but otherwise it was a hit with everyone! All staff members were very friendly and helpful as well. Can't wait to try it again some time soon!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ben W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/7/2019,4.0,"I can't say enough positive things about Farmacy's brunch. It's just sooo good.The place is very small. It is a galley style restaurant  with less than 20 tables. You order at a counter and the food is brought to you, but it isn't a fast food restaurant by any means.Order the biscuits and gravy! You'll thank me!!!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Justin H.,"Knoxville, TN",11/11/2019,5.0,"Although I have only been twice, Farmacy is quickly becoming one of my new favorites.   It is high-end food with quick serve convenience and prices.  EVERYTHING is good here. Seriously, the food is as good as many upscale restaurants.  I had the Vitality Bowl (Corn, black beans, sweet potato, avocado, tomato, feta, radish, red onion, sprouts, grilled chicken, and a fried egg on a bed of arugula) which was just excellent.  They also have seasonal veggies, soups, and sides.  We ordered the brussel sprouts with drizzled honey and walnuts.  While I normally wouldn't like brussel sprouts (and the name brings back childhood fears)-- these were delicious.In addition to having great food, the service is outstanding.  Food was served quickly and, since you pay at the counter, there is no waiting around for the check.  The only downside is that the restaurant is a little bit small.  So, come early or plan for takeout if it is busy.Overall:  My highest recommendation.  This is great food/service at reasonable prices."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rick D.,"Limestone, TN",2/27/2021,1.0,"I have a medical condition that prevents me from wearing a face mask. When I told that fact to the hostess this afternoon, she became very aggressive and said she didn't care, I had to up out it on while we walked (all full 10 feet!) to our table, where we could take them off. I told her that was absurd- all of the tables were occupied, with people just a couple feet apart, none of them wearing masks. She then brought out her EXTREMELY aggressive, immature, arrogant manager, who told me that my medical condition didn't matter to her, and that if I didn't put he mask on she would call the cops. I told her she was the one violating the law, and she actually dialed 911.I was only in town for the afternoon, and I didn't want to waste my time to press charges against her for her ignorance of the law. I hope the owner sees this and trains his staff on the law on ADA. Absolutely horrible customer service.Show less"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kate R.,"Maryville, TN",10/5/2018,2.0,"I really wanted to love this place. I'm sad I don't. It's an adorable spot and I love all of the plants, light strands and easy going vibe. You order at the counter then take a card to your table and your food is delivered to you. My first visit was a couple of weeks ago with a group of coworkers. None of us had been before and we didn't realize how TINY this place is inside. It's not ideal at all for parties of more than 4 people. There were about 10 of us and the lady working the counter seemed annoyed at this. I ordered the club sandwich which came with bacon, pimento cheese, fried green tomatoes, lettuce and tomato and was sorely disappointed. There was maybe a tablespoon of pimento cheese on the whole sandwich so I honestly have no clue how it even tasted and two slices of bacon. The fried green tomatoes were decent and the house chips were ok. I left still feeling hungry.Thinking I'd just ordered a dish I didn't love, I decided to give it another try today with a friend. This time I ordered the French dip, subbed the chips for mac and cheese and a tea. My total was a whopping $24 for a dang sandwich! The French dip was ok. The au just was the star of the dish but the meat in the sandwich was basically pot roast. The chipotle mac and cheese was good.Like I said I really wanted to love this place but just don't. I'm willing to give it another try to sample their brunch menu."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Tina H.,"Vaucluse, SC",7/28/2021,5.0,"Late this afternoon my husband and I ate at Farmacy.  We had cornbread and Brussel sprouts as starters. I had the tacos with grilled chicken as my entree and my husband had the hot chicken.  Stephan was our server.  He is also the bartender.  Very helpful with the menu but also super personable.  All of the food was incredible! Tacos were just spicy enough.  Stephan asked my husband if he liked spicy because the hot chicken was spicy.  Turns out it definitely had a big kick to it.  :). Also, even if you don't like Brussel sprouts, try these!  My husband loved these and he generally does not like them.  Can't say enough good things about this place."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Amy C.,"Mason, OH",6/27/2021,5.0,Excellent service. Excellent food. Cute spot. I had the Cure All but with a lettuce wrap and it was fantastic. Others at my table had the Enlightened Bowl and the Dave's Eggs all was excellent.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Laura P.,"Kingston, TN",3/13/2021,3.0,"Loved the beignets. The raspberry sauce was delicious and they came out quickly. The rest of the visit wasn't nearly as great. It was extremely noisy, we couldn't hear each other to have a conversation and it was very cold inside. We had the French dip which was very salty and the biscuits and gravy which were very sweet. The food took quite a while to come out as well. Our choices were both recommended by our waitress, but we were not impressed. Total cost $41."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",4/19/2018,5.0,"Best meal I had during my week stay in Knoxville! Came for lunch with coworkers and it's small and cozy inside. Great decor as well.Ordered the Southernaire with grilled chicken and a side of mac and cheese of course! It is a little pricey here, but great ingredients.The salad was amazing, had all the things I liked and with a fried egg! Felt very healthy! The mac and cheese was okay, too oily for my tasting.Will definitely be back!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Beth S.,"Livingston, TN",5/11/2021,3.0,"Not an overwhelmingly great experience...stopped in for a late lunch and sat on patio. Husband's Good Ole Boy sandwich (aka French dip) and fries was very disappointing... bland and unappealing, fries were limp and not crispy at all. I had the wedge salad with grilled chicken, and I enjoyed it- crispy, fresh, excellent ratio of toppings to lettuce.  Beer selection was mostly IPAs, which wasn't what we wanted today. Brightest note of the meal was the chive cornbread with honey butter appetizer."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Chelsea B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/13/2021,5.0,Best chicken in town bar none. I wish there was dish without the hot sauce or without waffles. It's good enough to shine on its own. Whenever I just ask for it as it is though they always accommodate.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Laura G.,"Murfreesboro, TN",2/21/2021,3.0,Traveling and saw this place from the road. We stopped and went in. There was an empty bar and many empty tables. One couple standing in lobby where a hostess told them they could sit at bar. We asked to sit at bar and were told 45 minutes that they were going to sit a family at the bar.?!?!?  They really didn't seem to know what was going on. We left rode across the street and sat down and had amazing service and food at Gourmet Market & Cafe. It's important to make room for walk in and the bar is a great way to offer this.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Shalin P.,"Alpharetta, GA",9/23/2019,5.0,"This is a great brunch spot. I would come back and order the spicy buffalo fries appetizer, and the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken dish. The biscuits and fried chicken were great. The only change I would recommend is getting hot sauce for the fried chicken. The fruit iced tea is also really good."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Toya M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/26/2019,5.0,"Omg!!! I'm current sitting here right now, FULL, SATISFIED, HAPPY!!! The food is phenomenal the service is awesome! And the overall feel of this little restaurant is so cozy! We had beignets(you get 3 that cone out hot and DELI IOUS and served with a strawberry sauce that's just mind blowing!), biscuits and Gravy(my suggestion for this I'd ask for extra gravy on the side you're going to need it!!!) and chicken and waffles with the spicy habernaro sauce on the chicken, TO. DIE. FOR!!!!Loved everything about this place will definitely be back!!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,jackie a.,"Hollywood, FL",3/21/2021,5.0,"Amazing good food, but long wait. Jordan was great. Definitely recommend coming here for food and brunch"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/17/2017,2.0,"What a disappointment! Their biscuit looked so pretty but it was so dry. I tried using gravy to make it better but their gravy was similar to chili. Is biscuit with chili a thing? I discarded the biscuit and ate the insides of the farmacy sandwich. Besides the dry biscuit, the sandwich overall lacked flavor. I tried mixing it other dishes to give it flavor and nothing saved it. The chicken and waffle was the best choice on the menu. The chicken wasn't that crisp but still decent. I guess you can't go wrong with chicken and waffles. I also tried the soup, chipotle mac and cheese and chili which were all average."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Paisley T.,"Seattle, WA",6/25/2017,5.0,"Every new spot always has some kinks to fix. Well, I'm here to tell you that Farmacy is doing everything right. Sure, they could make sure the tea and coffee gets refilled more quickly. And do something about the bottleneck hovering around the counter. Sure they could put a tad less oil on the dish. But we are getting nit-picky. Everything here is outstanding.already. Seriously. Wow!My biscuit weighed 1 pound. Dayum. The avocado toast on hearty grainy bread is simply delicious. And for heaven's sake please order the poppyseed pancakes and enjoy the pistachio crunch surprise. The fruit tea is a real treat. Hits the spot on a warm day. The coffee at brunch is really good. I can't wait to try the salads and the dinner service. All the prices here are on point. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. What a great value. I bet you 1 million dollars that Farmacy will expand in less than 3 years. Maybe move to a bigger location. Maybe open 2 more locations in the Knoxville sprawl. This place is outstanding."
farmacy-knoxville-2,C R.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2021,5.0,"I finally got the chance to visit the new location yesterday, specifically to try the lobster roll. It is delicious! The new space is gorgeous and the full bar is a definite plus! The staff is friendly. Service is superb. A definite Jewel in Knoxville!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Isaac W.,"Nashville, TN",4/2/2019,3.0,"Decent food. Didn't really want to hear the ENTIRE Imagine Dragons catalogue this morning.We got the Burger and Maple Glaze Salmon. Burger was dry and I needed to spoon out ketchup to make it palatable. Fries were GREAT.Maple glaze salmon was basically a well cooked piece of salmon with maple syrup on it. Green beens were soggy and mashed potatoes were VERY rustic.We more than likely won't come back but if you're cool with what we've posted, go for it!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Marie T.,"Knoxville, TN",4/12/2021,5.0,"Super cute place with fantastic food. My husband had the Hot Chicken and loved it. I had a vitality bowl and they are delicious! Our bartender Alex was incredible, his lemon drop martini may be the best drink I've ever had and my husband was blown away by his Old Fashioned. 100% will be back for more!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jo S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/31/2020,5.0,"The southern fried tofu sandwich rivals the TH Kepner Melt for best vegetarian sandwich in Knoxville. Oh those pickles!! No pictures. I couldn't stop eating after I started. 10/10 stars. I also got the Mac n cheese (super cheesy penne), potatoes (pretty standard), a house salad (gorgeous veggies), and the veggie plate. After the sandwich I couldn't fit anything else in my belly, but I'm betting it will all be fantastic. This vegetarian is impressed."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Thomas B.,"Lake, Oceanside, CA",10/1/2021,5.0,The guy who had the tofu burger was from california. That's why he gave 3 stars. Who goes to a scratch kitchen and has tofu? Who complains about vegetarian options on a menu? Order a side salad or something... or some raw cucumber or whatever you people eat. This might be the best breakfast in the country... trust me. It's fresh and they make their own stuff and don't try to do too much. Oh and they have the best coffee anywhere
farmacy-knoxville-2,Elizabeth G.,"Memphis, TN",2/28/2021,5.0,"Great service!! Food was great as well. The atmosphere is adorable, and it is covid-safe. I really enjoyed going here for brunch, and I will definitely go back for brunch/try dinner."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Dennis D.,"University, Cleveland, OH",2/28/2021,4.0,We went here with the family for a late lunch and absolutely enjoyed the food.You pay a bit extra but it's all fresh and very tasty.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Natalie E.,"Knoxville, TN",10/26/2017,3.0,"I wanted to like this place a lot, but sadly I think it's both a tad over-priced and over-rated. I keep bouncing between 2 and 3 stars. My friend even got food poisoning from her lunch. She had the Country Club, iced tea, and banana pudding.I loved that its fresh and I love the atmosphere. It's a very cute location. We didn't have much of a wait and the lady at the front desk was polite. (We were there at 1pm after the lunch rush.)I had the Farmacist, I figure go for their name sake. Good mix of pork and egg, but the biscuit was intense. It was thick and heavy to the point I was joking instant gluten overload. It overpowered the sandwich so I ate the insides without it. I would totally order that biscuit for breakfast solo, but as a sandwich it had me wishing for a lighter bread option like a brioche bun perhaps? The homemade chips were ok. Thin cut and salted.And the banana pudding was good, just spendy for a small thing of pudding.The total for mine was over $17. Too expensive for lunch and to not be the perfect meal. And with my friend getting sick, we probably won't be back here for awhile!edit -- yes, as the response pointed out, it's REALLY hard to say that it was food-poisoning. Although my friend doesn't have children and just had cereal for breakfast. It might have been 24-hour flue."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Deb W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/11/2021,5.0,"I've eaten here twice in the past month--once for brunch and once for dinner.  I had an excellent experience both times.  First, let me say the Brussels sprouts appetizer was wonderful!!  You must try it.  The beignets on the brunch menu were also really good.  I shared both of these dishes with the friends I was dining with and all loved both dishes.  My entree's were also delicious.  The atmosphere was pleasant and welcoming.  The outdoor patio was great and, inside, the tables were spaced far enough apart to make me comfortable.  The hostess and waitstaff were friendly and helpful."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Chelsea R.,"Knoxville, TN",3/23/2019,5.0,"I love this place! The food is always so good and the staff are super nice ! I've never had a bad meal, but my two current favorites are the hot chicken fries and the nachos. Both of them are UNREAL. The hot chicken sauce is to die for. I would probably eat it on anything, just need a vehicle to transport it to my mouth. You really can't go wrong with whatever you order here. Just a heads up though, it's usually pretty warm inside, so if you're sensitive to that try to sit towards the front where you get a breeze whenever the door opens. Or just sit outside if it's nice out !"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Larry C.,"Knoxville, TN",6/7/2021,3.0,This was a disappointing visit.  The food wasn't hot and the hostess was rude when I told her my chair had syrup on it and then I had it on me.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Nancy E.,"Shingle Springs, CA",6/7/2021,3.0,"We ate here a couple of weeks ago. We had eaten at another breakfast restaurant the day before (down the street) so I guess we were comparing our experiences. I'll start by saying It was a busy Sunday lunch. We had a reservation and was seated close to our time slot. I think our server had just ""shown up"" that day.  We had trouble getting her attention several times. Our food (eggs, bacon,  potatoes etc.) finally came out and it was barely luke warm. The quality was mediocre. We were so disappointed. We felt as if we wasted our money and our time. It has a cute interior but that's not what really matters is it? There are too many other places where we would rather spend our money."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jaime O.,"Knoxville, TN",11/2/2018,5.0,"Wonderful!  I have visited twice and each meal was fabulous. I have had the pleasure of dining on the beef brisket and the hot chicken. The beef brisket was so tender that I could cut it with my fork! The hot chicken was this amazing meld of hot, sweet and savory.   The restaurant is small, cozy and beautifully decorated to leave you feeling as if you are enjoying a meal with friends in an outside country garden. This is an amazing locally owned family establishment."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Linda G.,"Corolla, NC",2/9/2021,5.0,Oh my goodness but I have never had a better taco than I had here. Welcome to Bearden! I can hardly wait to try other items on the menu.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Blaine W.,"Indianapolis, IN",12/6/2019,5.0,"Love this gem off Northshore.  Son had the lobster pot pie, great choice as it was extra creamy and cheesy and full of lobster bites.  I had the shrimp and grits, very filling and had a good balance of starch and shrimp.  Very friendly staff and I'll be back for $8 burgers on Thursdays."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jessica P.,"Birmingham, AL",7/27/2021,4.0,Food is delicious. Service is hit or miss. They really need to invest in a sun shade so no one is blinded during the dinner. So if you don't mind waiting awhile for a delicious drink you are sure in for a treat. Invest in a sunshade...
farmacy-knoxville-2,Alejandro L.,"Maryville, TN",6/18/2018,2.0,"My wife and kids wanted to bring me here for Father's Day Brunch which I was very excited about after reading reviews, looking at the menus, as well as visiting their website. Our expectations were extremely high as we were set up from the previous explanations, but fell rapidly not by the food, but by the experience shortly after we ordered.You do order up at a counter which is not a problem or me at all, but the greatest debate in the industry, do you leave gratuity, or Not? My wife and I did leave 20% as we always do. (I wouldn't leave gratuity at this place again. You'll understand as you read the review in full.) We ordered water which the gave us a 6oz glass Ball Jars with a couple cubes of ice upon leaving the counter to our seat. (No kids cups-at least they didn't offer?)I thought this was very interesting as you have to hold/take your drinks to your seat. In our case small empty glass jars with just ice as we didn't even have water yet?As someone led us to our seat, we waited a couple min and then I stopped someone and asked to get some water? (Again interesting/why did we tip again? We don't have a server?)We were sat by this oddly placed barn door that you could see right in the kitchen. I did look into it a couple times as I did see several unclean kitchen stations. One being right in the window as you look. It was a single electric burner that has a dirty oily sauté pan in it. Keep in mind this place was very busy as their was a 5-10min wait time. Though, after our order we did get our seat within 2min. (4x- my wife and 2 children) Shortly after we sat, both tables on each side of us were sat too! Our meals took approximately 15-20min. My wife mentioned something to me about the wait and she never says anything. We are never in a hurry at restaurants and this was long. Which at this timeframe I believe a good idea would be to offer/have something brought to the table? The meals made it out and the did look fabulous and the taste was exquisite as well! Though, as mine was brought to me they did forget some toppings for my Sandwich that they later had to bring out. Similar situations happened with both tables on each side of us as they received their food. One of the tables received food without utensils being on the table? The women asked the ""food runner"" which the employee told them they would get it. My wife and I offered our spare utensils, the lady declined and mentioned , ""they are getting some for us.""Time passed and the guests ended up having to get up and find someone for utensils. (Again, why are we tipping?) This place has a lot of potential. Decor was very earthy with all the plants, color, and greenery throughout. As for the seating, some spots were dark in the back. Honestly this reminded me of a caffe in Europe. Almost like a quick grab and go lunch spot. Which leads me to say, I'm not sure Farmacy has their concept down just yet? Not the best ""date"" spot as it is very tight seating, and loud. Not the best family place.Lastly, my biggest reason for my stars are the service and experience. My wife and I literally walked out of their pay $40.57 including tip. We don't have a problem with that for the great food. Though we can spend that same money at another good ""local"" spot and have a much better experience. If this place is busy when you walk in, I'd pass and go to another restaurant."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lynne F.,"Woodbine, GA",6/15/2021,5.0,Brisket on French dip was tender and delicious. Fries hand cut and crispy. Our waiter was very efficient and friendly
farmacy-knoxville-2,Brittany B.,"Lexington, SC",7/13/2021,5.0,Random find from Yelp as we were passing through the area. Cool spot. Awesome food! We will be back!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Brandon B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/30/2021,4.0,"Churro donuts were great! Atmosphere was amazing. The only downside was I feel like the menu is reaching a bit too far. It lacked a bit of fluidity in my opinion. Service was good, can't complain much there. Good place to try"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Angela B.,"Lebanon, OH",6/30/2021,5.0,"The service & the food was Top Notch! If we lived near here, we would be dining at Farmacy a lot. Thank you for a great brunch- the Cure-All substitute the bun for Lettuce wrap, Dave's Eggs served with sweet potato hash, my husband had the bowl with salmon. Delicious!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Y. G.,"Dallas, TX",12/11/2019,5.0,"Great little eatery and I do mean little. It's tight inside, but it makes sense. Usually when I go to small restaurants like this, it means it's going to be goo; I wasn't disappointed. Their food is simple, but very tasty. I went there for breakfast and I had Dave's eggs and partner had biscuits and gravy. Both meals were awesome! Their biscuits are amazzzing!! I also had a coffee, which comes from honeybee coffee shop . This was my first time drinking their coffee and I'm definitely a fan now. This was also my first time at this restaurant and I will definitely be coming back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Elon A.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",4/15/2018,5.0,"Loved loved loved this place! I'm so glad I found it, I might be here once a week if I get the time. The food here is delicious and the people are super nice! I ordered myself a healthy bowl because I'm doing Keto diet so I couldn't have the chicken and waffles but all my friends did and they loved it. The health now was also delicious I couldn't believe it, when I ordered it I was a little bummed out that I couldn't have all the good and yummy stuff but after my bowl came my friends were jealous of me they wanted my bowl. Anyway the chicken and waffles my friends said are top of the line and the Nashville chicken was delicious and spicy, they had this habanero sauce that was super spicy but also keeps you wanting more. I will definitely be back here soon. Check out my pics!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rachel H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/23/2019,5.0,"Wow!!! We stopped in here for lunch today, absolutely amazing!! My daughter got the cure all sandwich and I got the enlightened salad. We split the hot fries, everything was fresh and the staff was excellent."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Richard N.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2018,5.0,"This is probably the very best clean food restaurant.They make from the scratch and coming from local farm.... if you from Knoxville or visiting town... go try this place. Try the farmacy, vitality bowl and Nashville chicken....."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rachel H.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/1/2018,3.0,"The atmosphere is lovely, and the staff is super friendly and nice. The food is a bit overpriced. I got the farmacy sandwich, it was very good, but the biscuit was extremely dry. The fries were good. The waitress did not bring out everyones food at the same time and since we had to wait a while they gave us free dessert coupons. I got the nutella layer cake which was very good. Overall, I enjoyed this restaraunt and would go back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",5/25/2018,4.0,"Brunch options are on point. Sandwich options are on point. Beverage options are on point because they also have bottled beer.Open seating concept. Casual. Walk up ordering and the food will come to your table. First come, first serve. Seating can be limited since this place is pretty small. So if you're thinking brunch at the usual times, more than likely everyone else is thinking the same.Must try: hand spanked biscuit"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Amanda S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",11/15/2017,5.0,Cute spot! Love the vibe and feel of this little gem! The food was amazing! I got the Tostada brunch jam! The flavor was on point. My husband got the chicken and waffles. Love the seasoning on the chicken. Self service coffee and speciality drink area. Expect to spend a little money. Everything is fresh so its not just your average fast/brunch spot.I can't wait to go back! OPEN for dinner Tuesday-Sunday I believe???
farmacy-knoxville-2,Sherissa S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3/17/2018,4.0,"Overall: 4.5/5 starsI feel like my husband and I have had lucky experiences because each time we've come to Farmacy, it's never been busy so service has been timely and food not rushed. Granted,  we've always come an hour before closing or after opening so I can't say much for busy times. Overall,  I feel Farmacy does a great job of using local ingredients to create flavorful dishes at a decent price. You're not paying for fast food or a fancy sit down, and the portions are a good size for what you pay for. Service has been ok,  not friendly, but not rude either. Food highlights:Beignets: warm, freshly fried dough that is extremely tasty.  The beignets are a grrat size for what you are paying. I liked the berry honey dipping sauce on the side too, the tartness complimented the sweetness of the dish *5/5Chicken waffles: Wow, the rosemary chicken was definitely the highlight here-moist and very flavorful! I would ask for syrup on the side because the waffles get soggy fast. *4/5Chicken tinga: basically a giant tostada with chicken, beans, corn, cheese,  an egg, and arugula on top. No real wow factor here,  but a good portion *3/5Hot chicken: again,  the highlight was the chicken- a whole lot of spicy sweetness that you had to keep eating, but the toast got soggy really fast with the yummy sauce *4/5BBQ plate: the dish wasn't horrible,  just mediocre. Honestly I enjoyed the biscuit the most in this dish because the pork seemed undersalted and lacked overall flavor without the sauce all over it. The potatoes were like a rich mash with some butter or cream-tasty, but really heavy. *3/5Chicken pot pie: I enjoyed the pastry puff as the ""crust,"" with the filling reminiscent of homemade pot pie, with elevated flavors. *4/5Burger: massive burger with onion rings and pimento cheese that is quite tasty, you can't go wrong with this!  Can easily serve two people! *4/5Desserts:  I've tried a variety of their desserts, and I have a massive sweet tooth!  Unfortunately, the flavors for their desserts tend to fall flat for me, as well as being overly sweetened.  Guess I'll have to get dessert elsewhere :( *2.5/5Since my husband and I live so close,  I can see Farmacy becoming a staple for a quick, tasty meal that is made with love!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Emilie H.,"Maryville, TN",5/9/2021,5.0,"Absolutely delicious!  Food A+, Service A+.  I would suggest getting the Mac and cheese.  It was the best I've ever had!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kira F.,"Punta Gorda, FL",6/20/2020,5.0,"Wow! We were very hungry (family of 8) driving back to Orlando. Pleasantly surprised. The staff was very nice, the restaurant was clean, the food smelled delicious, & man the food tastes delicious. You have to try the chicken and waffles. We asked for the chicken and waffles to be put on the churro waffles and man was it amazing!!! Please don't hesitate and go to this little place."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kelly F.,"TN, TN",11/9/2017,4.0,"Very tasty items, with a good amount of variety. If I had any suggestion, it would be to have some less expensive lunch items. We liked everything we had, and even ordered an extra side (fried green tomatoes, wonderful). I'd be more willing to pay the $10-$15 prices for dinner, but for lunch it'd be nice to have such good items in the $6-$8 range. I do admit that some items were under $7 but not many. (On the price range choices below, I put it in the $11-$20 category because most items with a drink will take you over $10.)Also, what's with places that have you pay AND include the tip before any service? I know that tipping is now more an obligation than really showing gratitude for service...but still, what the hey? I have to tip the service before any service is done?"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ashlie K.,"Kingston, TN",7/3/2020,2.0,Meh.... I don't get what the fuss is about. Some weird combos of ingredients. Like they're trying to be fancier than what they are.
farmacy-knoxville-2,G V.,"Knoxville, TN",5/3/2021,5.0,I've never written a Yelp review before but had to for this restaurant. The southern friend tofu sandwich blew my mind. Definitely the best tofu anything I've had. So satisfying. Also all the staff was super friendly and personable.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",7/17/2017,3.0,"With the continuing of our search for the brunch that we will come back over and over, we landed here at the Farmacy as it's a new place that Knoxville that just opened. It's right next to Northshore Brasserie, so knowing that this area was pretty competitive in the brunch scene. So walking in, it's not your usual seated waiting service, rather it's more of a self service sort of experience similar to a café.  Walk in and the menus are on racks hanging to the right, grab one off, and order right there at the counter. It reminded me more of the French market creperie restaurant and that style of ordering. You get a number of your table and you go and sit.  The seating it's more closer than usual, so if you're not used to sitting there I would recommend tables closer to the door because the only seating further back is just a long bench and a hallway. Decorations hang from the top of the ceiling and strewn lights convey of rustic/barn house sort of look. So the food...I ordered the Chicken Tinga, since really I haven't seen that on the yelp pictures, I thought it would be something to try out and report back. And that will probably be the last time I do that. The Chicken Tinga was okay, but just wasn't filling and to me wasn't well worth it. What I should've done was go with my instincts and got the chicken and waffles. But, the only problem and why I didn't get that was because that I just had chicken and waffles just the morning before. I think the Chicken Tinga was just okay, there's nothing special about it. Chicken and waffles on the ohter hand was plentiful and it was pretty massive. Definitely should look into it if you ever come here for brunch.GF got the Dave's Eggs, let's just say they don't know how to poach eggs. When the SO ask for it, they weren't even sure if they did it, should've been a red flag for us. (This was actually the first time someone ordered poached eggs before) It came out with way too much vinegar and the yolk was pretty much cooked through. I think this is something that they don't have experience in. So, if you do order that just don't get poached eggs and you'll be fine.  The dish was sort of uninspiring, nothing special it was plain, eggs, biscut, and potato hash. Eh. Farmacy is alright. I might come back for that chicken and waffles, but for our experience it was okay. I think that not knowing how to poach eggs, and having to be a brunch spot, is eh. I know it's not requested often, but I think it's something valuable to know especially if you offer brunch.  Farmacy will be on the list of places to revisit, but for now it's just an okay brunch for me."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Brandon S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/25/2021,5.0,"First time here and definitely not the last ! Can't wait to try their brunch ! Everything we had was amazing ! The cornbread was great , had corn in it and lots of sweet melting on top ! Mouthwatering fried chicken tenders with a tasty breading and a sweet habanero sauce ! French fries were freshly cut and were crispy and delicious !! Everything in this restaurant was very clean and the service was excellent ! I had an Old Fashioned made with Woodford Reserve and it was a must have if you like old fashioned drinks , prob one of the best I've had ! I highly recommend this place"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Amye K.,"Knoxville, TN",6/2/2018,4.0,"Farmacy is a good addition to the Northshore/Pellissippi area.  They feature locally sourced, in-house made meals.  The downside is it's counter service with a long, narrow dining area that is dark (not in a romantic way) and tight if they are busy.  Also loud (and not good) canned music.  Their menu features modern takes on Southern classics, so if you like biscuits, fried chicken, etc, you will be happy.  They also have a few healthier options -- my favorite is the vitality bowl.  Knoxville is sorely lacking in bowl options, and this is one of the best in town.  On my most recent visit, they had a strawberry mint water option, which was cool."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Pete S.,"Clarksville, TN",7/8/2019,5.0,Great food.  Great service Great staff Had a few of the dishes there all was good the Vietnamese coffee and beignets were terrific bonuses to the meal
farmacy-knoxville-2,Paul M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/27/2019,3.0,"First, this place is loud. It was even loud when I turned off my hearing aids. It was so loud the two women at the table next to us had to shout to hear each other.  Now for the food,  average.  Interesting menu poorly executed.  With the exception of the sweet potatoes my dish had no seasoning.  My wife's, avocado toast was too salty.   Breakfast was $28.00 for two people with just water to drink.  And did I say this place is loud.  I should also say if you go in winter dress for the outdoors. The concrete floors make the place colder than you would expect and if I have not said it enough it is very, very loud."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lauren F.,"Philadelphia, PA",5/11/2019,5.0,The picture speak for itself and fast service. Happy to have found this gem. The playlist is also exceptional! A classic soul brunch is good for the soul!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rita S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/15/2018,4.0,"Yet another spot to get your chicken and waffle fix. This is a small place with maybe 10 seating areas or so, so you can expect a line sometimes. I had to wait maybe 15 min before I had a seat. I had their chicken and waffles which I HEARD were amazing- but I think they were just okay, same thing you find at every other spot serving it. I ordered the Beignets but this too wasn't my favorite. They do have a good list of things one can order from, great service, cute place..."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",7/7/2019,5.0,"We stopped in for a late breakfast and so glad we did. I got the Sunny, avocado toast with perfect sunny side up eggs.

farmacy-knoxville-2,M M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2/26/2020,2.0,Way over priced and trying to hard to be hip. $18 burger with  fake cheese.  Seating also sucks. .............

farmacy-knoxville-2,Sunshine D.,"Brentwood, TN",4/8/2021,5.0,"Holy Cow! I just happened to be in Knoxville for the day (traveling from Nashville) and I asked my friends on Facebook -""where should I have lunch?""several people recommended Farmacy and I'm so durn glad that they did! That cornbread is amazing ...with honey butter  what the heck is in there? I need to know how to make that! Seriously, someone tell me what they do to that cornbread - I must know! The brussels sprouts with pears and pepper jelly- oh.my.God. I left off the bacon because I don't eat pork - it was so good you don't even need the pork. (Nashville Brussels are all the same, good but not nearly this freaking good!)The good old boy (a French dip kinda sandwich ) and the strawberry salad were both absolutely fantastic ( my daughter and I split those) and that banana pudding is to die for - with salted Carmel and a shortbread cookie- I may have died and gone to heaven! I have to go back to Knoxville to eat at this place again -it was REALLY that good! Please ya'll, open one in Nashville and I will give you all my money!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Dale S.,"Haymarket, VA",4/10/2019,5.0,"This place is small, not great for groups, but has an inviting and intimate atmosphere. Think of it like a gourmet farm-to-table cafe. You place your order at the entryway-counter and they bring the food to you. Get over it.The shrimp tacos are absolutely fantastic! I didn't need to add any toppings at all and the heat is perfect. (If you don't put tobacco on your eggs, they'll be too 'spicy' for you)I'll be coming back with bells on."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Stormi T.,"Toano, VA",6/10/2019,4.0,"The concept here is really cool, I love the farmhouse style of the restaurant and the menu has a lot of delicious options. It's a small restaurant that you order at the front and seat yourself, it's a great place for a date or a very small group of people. My husband got tacos and I got the BBQ platter and overall it was very good! My husband really liked his tacos, especially the chicken one. The chipotle macaroni and cheese was super tasty. I bet the breakfast/brunch here is amazing. We will definitely come back here!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,MaryJane M.,"Cedar Bluff, Knoxville, TN",1/23/2021,4.0,"The kitchen staff is still working out the kinks at their new location. Once they work out the expo and timing, it'll be even better than the old spot on Northshore. Food was tasty and service was excellent, just a bit bumpy getting all plates out hot and around the same time. We'll be back!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Becky B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/14/2017,5.0,"Trendy indie vibes, organic restaurant! I had the salmon burger it was delish! Variety of fresh flavored teas. You can eat inside or outside too. Must come for brunch or lunch date."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Wilhelmina H.,"Knoxville, TN",9/12/2018,2.0,"I came here the first time on opening day and it was fantastic. Came back again today after a dermatology appointment across the street for something to eat because I was miserable. Just had a tattoo lasered off, that stuff hurts, but that's beside the point. Disclaimer: I love spicy food. I'm not shy at all when it comes to food with a kick and I never feel miserable after eating spicy food.  Enter, my partner and I, who both order the hot chicken because, well, hot chicken. It's spicy. We love spice. That's why we ordered it. First bite in and we could already tell it wouldn't end well. It was incredibly spicy. The flavor was there, but the spice was overwhelming to the point where it was impossible to enjoy anything else. Hidden behind absolutely ridiculous amounts of spice was an odd sweetness that did nothing for the dish and left us confused. I would have rather spent another hour at Southeastern Dermatology with a laser burning off my skin, that was enjoyable compared to trying to stomach another bite of the hot chicken. It's as if someone heard the word 'hot chicken' and then tried to replicate it with no knowledge of what the dish actually was. This ain't Nashville hot chicken, hunty. As of right now, my partner and I are laying in bed, miserable and quite certain that we will not make it through the eve. Farmacy, you're invited to our joint funeral, but you're not catering it. Don't even get me started on the terrible, limp excuse for pickles or the inch of grease I found at the bottom of my Mac and cheese. The service was great, though. If my upset stomach from this chicken is my undoing, please tell my cat I love her.UPDATE 5 minutes after posting review: The sheer amount of spice made me puke and the puke was equally spicy. Mother, I love you. Please cremate me."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Leena R.,"San Francisco, CA",10/11/2018,3.0,"I had high hopes for this place and didn't feel like it delivered. Don't get me wrong, the food was alright. But it was plated nicely and looked so tasty that I thought the flavors would deliver. It didn't. The Shrimp and Grits has a tomato based sauce that overwhelmed the dish, but not in a good way. Way too much acidity and it made the dish more reminiscent of pasta with Ragu sauce than southern shrimp and grits. The chicken and waffles were fine, but the chicken was lacking a bit. Maybe needs more salt. I will say that I loved the rosemary butter that came with it though! I also enjoyed the service and the clean interior. Probably wouldn't rush to come back here though."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Pam S.,"Kennett Square, PA",2/29/2020,5.0,"My husband and I had a late lunch here recently.  We were both impressed by everything.  The food was delicious.  I had the Nashville hot chicken.  It was sweet, spicy and delicious. I had the buttermilk potato salad and loved it!   My husband considers himself a burger aficionado, and said their burger was excellent.  It was on toasted ciabatta bread with onion straws.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  Would highly recommend this relaxing casual spot."

farmacy-knoxville-2,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",12/8/2018,4.0,"Stopped in here to get lunch to go. Since it was my first trip I decided to try a couple different things. I hate to say it but I didn't like the burger. The bacon didn't add any flavor and I don't think the meat was seasoned enough. The French dip, however, was really good. I'd come back here just for that alone. The meat was tender and the sauce was very flavorful. I also liked the fries. They were good and crispy but not over seasoned. I also liked the beignets but I think a slightly bitter chocolate sauce would be better than the strawberry. Not that it wasn't good.. I just like chocolate! They were subtly sweet which was a nice finish to the meal."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Alisa F.,"Aussersihl, Zürich, Switzerland",11/19/2019,5.0,Best meal I had during my week stay in Knoxville! Came for lunch with coworkers and it's small and cozy inside. Brunch options are on point. Sandwich options are on point. Beverage options are on point because they also have bottled beer. Great food. I usually get one of the power bowls/salads. The beef brisket was so tender that I could cut it with my fork! I got the Bella sandwich and loved the flavors. My friend tried veggie tacos and really liked hers. Happy to have found this gem.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jen W.,"Knoxville, TN",3/31/2019,5.0,Fast service and a large amount of food for the price! Super cute interior and friendly staff
farmacy-knoxville-2,Angela H.,"Knoxville, TN",1/30/2019,5.0,"I love this little hidden gem. This cutesy little farm to table restaurant serves up fresh dishes for every palette. Their hot chicken is a fire sensation with the most amazing ""crack-like"" quality. It will definitely have you coming back. If you're lucky enough to drop by on enchilada day, get those! If you're a banana pudding aficionado, give the salted caramel banana pudding a try. It's a bit sweet for me but it's got great flavor."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Frank C.,"Knoxville, TN",1/22/2020,5.0,"Wow! Found this place by accident.  Fantastic curb appeal drew me in with ambient lighting and country, artful decor.

farmacy-knoxville-2,De J.,"Maryville, TN",11/14/2018,4.0,"Cool vibe. Clean. Good food. This place is a small, casual place where you order at the counter. I got the Hot Mess as a starter, which is their version of nachos. There's no cheese on it and it has BBQ sauce, which is not my favorite but it was still good. Different but good. For my main meal I got shrimp tacos. The ""fixings"" on the taco were great. The shrimp was a little spicy for my liking but it was still good. It would have been perfect with a tiny less spice. All in all, I liked it and would eat here again. I would advise giving it a try. I always like to support a small business like this. I think some of the reviews focused on service, which could be a result of initial growing pains. Those issues seems to have been worked out now as I didn't have to wait a long time for my food and the service was friendly and prompt."
farmacy-knoxville-2,K L.,"Nashville, TN",11/3/2019,5.0,"I usually brunch at Oliver Royale when I'm in town, but I was worried about potential Sunday morning crowds over a game weekend so looked for an alternative via Yelp. How pleased I was to find this total gem in Northshore, an area I'm not extremely familiar with.To start, some of the friendliest service I've ever had, and most of the servers seemed to be students, too (glad they're getting some great hospitality training!). But the food was mind-blowingly good; my husband had the chicken tinga, which we both give an A+, and I had the best chicken and waffles in my life that came with a habanero hot sauce, rosemary butter and a rosemary-maple syrup. It was the perfect combination of sweet, spicy and savory. We also ordered the lemon poppyseed pancakes to share, simply because they looked too good to pass. I'm in Knoxville about once a quarter, and Farmacy will definitely be added to my regular rotation!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Marissa M.,"Eglin Air Force Base, FL",11/18/2018,4.0,"Beautiful restaurant, ordered the biscuits and gravy..It was good however it was cold. Went this morning, not to busy and got a table fast. We will be back, I just hope the next time my food isn't cold."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lindsey F.,"Lexington, KY",10/3/2018,5.0,"Traveling from out of town and my husband and I are both pharmacists so we were excited to try this place out.

farmacy-knoxville-2,Julia C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/11/2018,2.0,"Gave this place a shot for lunch one day. I called ahead and ordered a Southernaire salad with grilled chicken to-go because my dog was with me. They said it would be 20 min. Okay no big deal. 20 minutes later I'm in the restaurant and it's not ready. Idk why a salad takes 20 min to throw together but still trying to give it the benefit of the doubt here. Get home and take the salad out, nice to-go container, extra dressing. Promising. But for a $15 price tag, pretty small. The worst part though was the size of the grilled chicken. I would estimate that before it was cut up, it was the size of one medium tender. Now, I realize that adding chicken is extra. I paid for it but judging by the amount, one would assume that it was included. I've NEVER seen such a small portion of chicken dished out as an add on. You're going to ask me to pay $15 for a salad + grilled chicken but not going to even give me enough meat for half the salad? For shame. Really grinds my gears. Overall, decent salad. Nothing to write home about. Certainly don't feel like I got my money's worth. Could have gotten way more bang for my buck (and twice the chicken) at a McAllister's or Jason's. Hopefully the rest of the menu at Farmacy lives up to the hype. I had high hopes because it looks like a cool place and I like the concept. I would rather give a small business a chance than spend my money at a chain restaurant but I was disappointed."
farmacy-knoxville-2,B C.,"Riverside, CA",11/8/2019,5.0,Nice hole in the wall restaurant. Great chicken tacos with lots of flavor. Friendly service! Owners daughter at cash register was a delight!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Elizabeth D.,"Lake Zurich, IL",12/7/2019,2.0,"The beignets were very good. I had chicken and waffles, the waffles were cold. The chicken was underwhelming. The husband had shrimp and grits. The grits were good but they put way too much marinara sauce on them, completely overpowering the dish. I would say it is a bit over priced, especially since  they take your order at the counter."

farmacy-knoxville-2,oola l.,"Richmond, VA",9/25/2018,5.0,"I was there a few weeks back with hubby while in town on business. After traveling for a few days, what an amazing treat it was to find this restaurant! The food is amazing, the chef's palate leaves you wanting more. For me the issue is trying to find food that doesn't contain soy or canola, which usually limits me to a bit of a bland burger and lettuce with no dressing. Not here, I was able to eat most of the foods on their menu. They were so kind and accommodating and it was so over the top delicious that We considered relocating there. We ate every meal there while we were in town and enjoyed ever bite.The shrimp boil on Friday's was so good, it was spicy in just the right way. The salad's were delicious, with dressings that I could actually have!! :) They make a crazy good cold brew, if you are a coffee nut like I am. Hubby got the desserts and loved them. I think he was secretly happy that he couldn't share it with me. The staff is very kind. You can bet whenever we go thru town, we are going to be stopping and staying right out around here!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Maureen H.,"Knoxville, TN",5/11/2019,1.0,"Finally got hubby to go bc it was Mom's day w.e. He is an omelette guy and they have none. Lots of avocado grain healthy stuff. Lady taking order at front was rude and very unwelcoming. Bad start. Then bc of a weak stomach. I just wanted a kids meal and beignets to share. She gave me down the rd for the kids meal request. I am 67 and can't eat mass quantities of food on a good stomach. She finally gave in after telling me the 2 pancakes were tiny. Untrue. The 2 lemon pancakes, fruit  and 2 slices of bacon were the perfect size for me. Offer a senior/ kid/ smaller portion size menu option. Hubby found biscuits, gravy and chicken.  Atmosphere is tight and blah. We will NOT be returning bc of sourpuss's reception. Large portions and looked to be healthy food."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Maria H.,"Southwest Ranches, FL",7/16/2019,1.0,"Nice decoration. Food not so good. I ordered the portobello mushroom burger that was on the special and it was way too salty. The chips were too salty, the mushrooms was soaked in Worcestershire Sauce, the aioli was salty too. I could not even finish. I will not come back. My fiancé was not happy with his food either and he found it pricey for the amount of food, specially cause beans are not really usually a fancy dish."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Richard D.,"Murfreesboro, TN",1/1/2020,4.0,"Driving home Gatlinburg to the house is about a four and a half hour trip, and when my wife says she is a little hungry, I know I had better stop.  Having read some of the online reviews of this restaurant I figured we could take a chance.  A little Strip mall out-of-the-way is not what I would anticipate being the best place to dine. There were about four customers in line and the place was packed.  I thought ""oh great this is a little coffee hang out and nobody will be moving"". It took about ten minutes after we had ordered our meal and paid for it before being seated. After we were seated it took another ten minutes before our food arrived.  One thing I have to say, it was well the wait. I have a roast beef sandwich I think they called it the old PO boy but simply put it was a delicious prime rib dip. My wife had the Chicken tacos and they were wonderful. The food obviously is prepared dedication and attention to detail for presentation.  Every now and then I will find a place that's a little out of the way that becomes one of my regular stops pharmacy definitely is going to be one every time I pass through Knoxville, TN"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jenny H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/31/2020,4.0,"The food is always top notch, I especially like their shrimp and grits and theGood 'ol Boy sandwich.

farmacy-knoxville-2,Trish O.,"Knoxville, TN",6/23/2019,5.0,"Went to brunch with my family. Husband ordered the avocado toast and fried eggs, daughter and son ordered biscuits and gravy which comes with fried chicken, I ordered Churros waffles. All food was delicious and cooked perfectly. We ordered beignets to go. Arrived at just the right time as there was a wait shortly after. Will definitely go again."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Chelsey W.,"Alcoa, TN",7/21/2017,1.0,"Huge disappointment. If you are into small, overpriced entrees inside a misleading farmhouse atmosphere where it is too loud to think, this place is perfect for you. The entrees sound appealing on the menu, but when placed in front of you, you don't know what to do with them. They are so small that I was appalled I had paid $15 for what I was given. I understand some places do not serve larger portions, but if I'm going to be given a sandwich big enough for only 2 bites, it better be the best sandwich I've ever tasted, and this wasn't the case. The name of the restaurant is misleading. You expect to be given whole, nutritious foods, given the name ""Farmacy,"" but it is still fried, sugar-filled, southern fixins. It doesn't matter if the food comes from a farm or a factory, if it's fried and filled with added sugar it's not ""pharmacy"" worthy to me. If you enjoy sitting in loud echoing noise so much so that you have to yell at the person sitting in front of you, give it a try."

Service was quick, and the food was fresh and delicious! We were there late afternoon having a late lunch, so the restaurant was not very crowded. The only sort of negative thing I could say is that seating is very limited - the place is small - so plan accordingly. Definitely recommend giving it a try!"

farmacy-knoxville-2,Cinda S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/8/2017,4.0,"Since I am vegetarian, there was limited things I could order. Mainly just a salad, biscuit and fried green tomatoes. Which is what I did!  The owner, Bettina, came around and visited with us and was really friendly and nice. She told us that she is willing to make some of the sandwiches without meat.  Also, she was considering adding some vegetarian items to the menu. The 'Southernaire' salad was a nice size and very good. We really enjoyed the dressing that came with it. The biscuit was too heavy for my liking, but the fried green tomatoes were good.  The owner, Bettina, found out it was my birthday and gave me a free dessert of my choice. I chose the Sweet Potato Cake with brown butter cream. It was dense, moist and delicious! Thank you Bettina!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kohl T.,"Knoxville, TN",5/9/2018,5.0,"My wife and I have eaten at the Farmacy probably 4 times now, and will continue coming back! As far as fast casual restaurants (or any restaurant in Knoxville right now) the menu stands out as fresh and creative and the ingredients are definitely top quality. Think aged white cheddar on the mac and cheese, not yellow craft liquid-goo. I usually get the brisket which is melt-in-your-mouth awesome, and my wife gets the shrimp and grits. Then, we both get food envy and end up eating each others food. They do serve beer, but we like to stop at the liquor store around the corner and pick up a bottle of wine to bring in. They are a new restaurant and still have some kinks to work out, so if you try something that isn't perfect, or your service is slower, just tell your waiter so they can make it right. Overall, a very welcomed restaurant to the neighborhood that I'm sure will keep getting better with age!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",8/11/2017,5.0,"I came into my meal here with low expectations due to the previous low reviews, but if any of the poor reviews were true it's safe to say these issues have already been addressed. The negative points mentioned in previous reviews were the polar opposite of my experience. Our food was delicious and I thought the portions were wayy more than enough! My husband and I shared a wedge salad and the brisket. Both were so good. The brisket was more like pot roast than what I was expecting, but delicious nonetheless. We didn't add any extra protein to the salad and I gave my husband quite a bit more than half of the brisket and I was still stuffed. Also got an extra side of green beans and they were perfection. Definitely no complaints from me and I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu."

farmacy-knoxville-2,Harley C.,"Knoxville, TN",10/6/2018,2.0,"I want to give Farmacy a higher rating. I really do.In fact, if I had written this review back in June/July, it would have been a 5-star review. We were new to the area and wanted some good food that was southern but not necessarily barbecue, and Farmacy seemed to do the trick. Melt-in-your-mouth brisket, well-seasoned and well-treated veg, AMAZING tomato jam... you name it, Farmacy had it covered.Well. ""Had"" is the key word.I'm not sure what's happened, but we've eaten at Farmacy 4-5 times since those initial visits a few months ago, and the quality has gone WAY down. Let me just sum up our latest meal there (a few weekends ago) to give you a picture of the food as it is currently.My mom's dish: The brisket. Yes, that same brisket that was knock-your-socks-off delicious the first time she had it. Not so this time. Imagine, if you will, a slice of brisket. Imagine that, on that 3-inch tall slice, 2 of those inches are fat and 1 inch is actual brisket meat. Now, maybe some of you wouldn't turn your noses up at this, but my mom likes to have some actual protein on her plate. She's also learned not to order extra veg on the side, as it tends to not be cooked in a very appetizing manner and just looks kind of depressing by itself.My dish: The special, salmon tacos. In Farmacy's defense, the soft corn shells were nicely toasted, the salsa fresh and tangy, vegetables crispy. The salmon was another story. It tasted fine, but never in my life have I eaten salmon that dry. It was like eating sawdust. Or maybe drywall.The biscuits: Biscuits should be a surefire win at a southern restaurant, right? I don't really know how to describe these biscuits. Hard? Dense? Gluey? Definitely not how we like our biscuits - there was nary a flake in sight.There's plenty to like about Farmacy, and I know they're capable of making excellent food. I really want small, local, farm-to-table spots to succeed. Unfortunately, Farmacy has been a solid ""miss"" for us on the last several visits. I hope they're able to return to their former glory soon."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kate R.,"Maryville, TN",10/5/2018,2.0,"I really wanted to love this place. I'm sad I don't. It's an adorable spot and I love all of the plants, light strands and easy going vibe. You order at the counter then take a card to your table and your food is delivered to you. My first visit was a couple of weeks ago with a group of coworkers. None of us had been before and we didn't realize how TINY this place is inside. It's not ideal at all for parties of more than 4 people. There were about 10 of us and the lady working the counter seemed annoyed at this. I ordered the club sandwich which came with bacon, pimento cheese, fried green tomatoes, lettuce and tomato and was sorely disappointed. There was maybe a tablespoon of pimento cheese on the whole sandwich so I honestly have no clue how it even tasted and two slices of bacon. The fried green tomatoes were decent and the house chips were ok. I left still feeling hungry.Thinking I'd just ordered a dish I didn't love, I decided to give it another try today with a friend. This time I ordered the French dip, subbed the chips for mac and cheese and a tea. My total was a whopping $24 for a dang sandwich! The French dip was ok. The au just was the star of the dish but the meat in the sandwich was basically pot roast. The chipotle mac and cheese was good.Like I said I really wanted to love this place but just don't. I'm willing to give it another try to sample their brunch menu."

I just don't feel like the people that work there are super friendly. The girl that was taking the orders was frazzled. I wanted to order the special of the day and sub the jalapeño baked beans out for fries because i just got over the stomach bug and she said it was a $3 upcharge she said it was different with daily specials. I respect that. No biggie. so i order the brisket meal with the mashed potatoes and they were out. Ugh...not my day there for sure. But she did suggest the french dip sandwhich so i said that's cool i will take that with fries. I got that and the kids chicken tenders meal and 2 waters and it was $20!! I was like for what? and she told me that $3 upcharge for fries again. I just feel like $3 is a steep upcharge but that's not my business i guess. Just wish she would've said that it was an upcharge on that one too. Just can't catch my groove there. The food was very good again. So that place is a catch 22 for me. After we ate my mom told me that while we were waiting at the front....the girl from the front was cleaning a table and my mom asked if she could sit there and the girl said ""no. It's for someone else. You can go back up front and wait for a table to open up."" I don't feel warm and fuzzy when i go there. I want so badly to feel it too. Maybe one more time???????        I wish I could give them 5 stars. I went with my friend and 2 year old and 8 mo old daughters. We got there around 1145 and I was pumped to only see 2 people in line. We walk in and see a sign that says order so we get a menu and get in line. When it's our turn I go first.....the girl was very sweet at the register but didn't ask us if we had been there before or explain how it all worked(which is the main reason why this review has 3 stars). I ordered the hot chicken and I'm still unsure if I actually got a side with it but I added fries because she said it was just chicken and Texas toast(I will get to how tiny the meal was later). I then decide on a cookie and water to drink. So she rings me up and hands me a number and glass full of ice. She did offer to help me to a table but I declined and set off on the rest of the unknown adventures. All of the tables were full and only high top tables left which I couldn't sit at with my 2 year old. I decided we would be fine at a 2 top so I sit and get my girls situated and my friend comes over with her water glass and number. I am looking for water and I see a little help yourself station and go over and there is tea and maybe a fruit tea or lemonade and coffee and a creamer type bottle. So I go back and sit and tell my friend there is no water there. Meanwhile a girl stops by our table and I asked her where we get our water from and she said well...the girl at the front is supposed to give it to you. And just looks at us and I said ok well she didn't. And she said we technically don't wait on you but I guess I can grab it for you. Uh thanks girl! Then she proceeds to tell us we bus our own table and the only they do is run the food. I'm fine with that but really wish it was explained and not told to us so point blank like that girl told us. I'm all about the concept of this restaurant. And how they run it but it needs to be more clear.  Now on to entree time. We are delivered our food. Me...the hot chicken and my friend got the spinach salad. Mine looks delicious. They did warn me how spicy it would be and it was that. So good! (I said earlier I wasn't sure if mine came with a side Or not but if it didn't it is not enough food for anyone). My 2 year old reached for a fry and spit it out. I'm not happy with her and I bite into them and sure enough they weren't done. So the girl finally walks by and we stop her and my friend ask for dressing (no apology on forgetting it) and I tell her the fries are underdone and she said do you want me to have them make you more? Something about this girl just rubbed me the wrong way from the beginning. I feel like she could've apologized and said I'm sorry I will get you more or something. Whatever....she brings my other batch of fries and it's the exact same situation. Underdone. I didn't feel like dealing with that girl again so I just didn't eat them and she didn't ask me about the 2 orders of uneaten fries in front of me. I want to try this place again and make this review 5 stars. It's close to my house, it's locally owned, and some of the other servers looked happy to be there. My cookie was very good! And I loved having a water bottle on the table. I drink a lot of water. I know the seating situation isn't the best but that's ok I can deal with that. They also had a big party with a lot of tables pushed together. I'm hoping maybe that server goes and finds another profession. And maybe they can explain how it works when you're ordering. It would be so much more helpful. I wish them good luck"

farmacy-knoxville-2,Stephanie T.,"Alcoa, TN",12/12/2019,5.0,Amazing food! They know what they are doing w food!! I highly recommend the specials because Bettina puts a lot of work into creating something special for you!!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Raymond F.,"Midtown, St. Louis, MO",10/20/2019,5.0,"The Churro Waffles were delicious. Diabetics beware!!!! The service is friendly, fast, and amazing. The atmosphere is comfortable, but can get loud."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Tammy J.,"Alcoa, TN",7/7/2017,5.0,"We had a good experience here today. It was closer to four stars, but I'm giving them five because they're new and still working out kinks--plus their inventive menu has lots of potential and I want them to stick around! I'll have to go back 4-5 times to try everything I'm interested in trying. But I do have some suggestions for improvement.1, Please, y'all, you must have sweet tea. You have an excellent cool ""New Southern"" menu, and we were shocked to see no sweet tea. 2, The fries. Sigh. I get that they're fresh and cooking fresh potatoes into fries isn't always easy and takes a while. Maybe try the par-cooking method or something, or else make them chunky home fries... but the limp pale things I paid $3 extra for today were disappointing. Anhwhere else, I would've sent them back. 3, My brisket sandwich was really good but the au jus was so salty, I couldn't use it. Fortunately it was still good without it.4, My brother's brisket was also great; we would've loved more of the tomato jam. The brisket is a very generous portion, but the jam was not nearly enough for all that yummy meat.Service was good and friendly, decor lovely and pleasant. We ate lunch after 2 and were happy to see that the place was still half full, even that late. Congrats, owners, on a great new place that we can't wait to try again."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Alan S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/6/2019,4.0,I stopped here for my first time and found this place cozy and full of delicious menu items. I had the biscuits and gravy and the dish was fabulous. I would suggest the fruit iced tea as a drink it was delicious.Now what I found strange is the ordering process it is not inviting!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Shawon G.,"Wilmington, NC",9/30/2018,5.0,"We have been to the Farmacy 3 times and have enjoyed it very much. The food is fantastic, the servings are large, and the people are nice. The food has always came out in a quick fashion as well. We will continue to support them as much as possible. The ""Rise and Shine"" is one of the best tasting things I've ever had."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lauren Y.,"Knoxville, TN",7/31/2019,5.0,Super cute small place. I love breakfast places so I gotta try them all.  This one has some awesome unique options and I had a great time
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ben K.,"Knoxville, TN",9/25/2019,5.0,Great food. I usually get one of the power bowls/salads. Allow plenty of time for them to prepare your great dish. Go try. Good take out as eell
farmacy-knoxville-2,Bethany H.,"Knoxville, TN",11/2/2019,5.0,This is honestly one of my favorite restaurants in Knoxville. I love the Brussels sprouts and hot chicken. Amazing farm to table food and a really cute atmosphere.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Laura H.,"Knoxville, TN",3/24/2018,4.0,"Cons: BYO Wine.....I didn't love that. I feel like that needs to be advertised on their website better (was it? Can't remember). They do have bottled beer which helped. Mine was not cold enough though.Pros: Yummy food for a decent price, kind staff, cute decor. Nutella cake was so huge and super yummy. I would go back....with my wine;)"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kate D.,"Knoxville, TN",9/13/2019,5.0,Amazing and SUPER attentive owner!  Wonderful food!!  I had had a poor experience when they first opened and she invited me back for lunch on the house about a year later.  What a huge difference!  Wish I hadn't prejudged before they had a chance to get in their groove.   I'd highly recommend!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kate D.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2017,1.0,"Terrible food, terrible service.  I will say the food had a beautiful presentation, however, the food was beyond bland.  No seasoning whatsoever.  We went for brunch and the hostess seemed confused when we asked if they would hold off on cooking our food until a table opened up so our eggs wouldn't be overcooked under a warmer.  Staff forgot all our drinks.  Overpriced and overall awful experience.  Will not return."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Phyllis H.,"Marietta, GA",9/3/2017,3.0,"Another business to Knoxville, TN from Atlanta, Ga.This place is starting to grow on me.It was a girls' luncheon with LB and me.  LB suggested Farmacy which is not far from our workplace.  LB saved us an outside table while I stood in line to order.  The restaurant is small and quite with a homely feel.  The concept of their food is farm to table. There were 3 people ahead of me and it took about 20 minutes for me to order.   I ordered a shrimp and grits for LB and I had salmons with green beans.  I was going to have the same with LB until I saw someone else's plate which looked really good.  It was last Monday and it was beautiful day in Knoxville. Slight overcast from Hurricane Harvey.  LB were both drinking fruit tea and having a non-work conversation when our food arrived.  The server (blond, pre-maturely older) served us our food, she asked ""Is there anything else I can get you?""  LB asked if she would kindly refill her fruit tea.  The server pretty said ""No, get it yourself."" Well, she didn't say it that but yes, she did.  Too late to take back my tip.  Having worked in the food industry before, you should never say no to such a request. LB's shrimp and grits were to die for.  However, my salmon was overcooked and the green beans were undercooked.  I did order the chipotle mac and cheese which was phenomenal. I do recommend this restaurant although the customer skills of the server was lacking.  I would return.  Maybe not during lunch.  Takes too long.  Maybe I'll wait another few months until they can get out their kinks. However, customer service should be number 1 and a kink that should never be ironed out.Yes, I would recommend it but don't forget your tea before you sit down."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Michael K.,"Atlantic Beach, NC",11/9/2017,5.0,"Hot chicken was GREAT! Fries were too. Mac n chz and the tomato bisque were a little rich for my taste but had great flavor. Friendly staff. First time, would recommend and definitely go again!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Dayana P.,"Murfreesboro, TN",9/1/2019,5.0,"It was worth making a stop at Farmacy. We ordered Avacado toast, hot chicken waffle. A complimentary beignets for moving over to another table . Hot chicken was very good and crispy. Food was Fresh. Restaurant ambiance was comfy.  Waitress was kind.Delicious food."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Annie R.,"Clermont, FL",7/5/2017,4.0,"What a cute little place for lunch! The hubs and I popped in on a Wednesday right around noon, and it was filling up quick! I love the fast casual concept here. We didn't wait too long for our food, and the servers were quite pleasant and helpful. We shared the Southenaire salad, Country Club sandwich, and the Farmacist sandwich. Can I just say, the biscuit on the Farmacist sandwich was AH-mazing. So good! Truly a cat head biscuit! I could have eaten a dozen of them. Ok, probably just one, but if I'd had the chance to order more as a side, I probably would have. For dessert we got the banana pudding. It was a perfect little sweet ending to our lunch. Glad to see some new choices on this side of town!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Timothy M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/5/2020,5.0,Nice cute neighborhood restaurant. Everyone is super friendly and the food was delicious.   You can bring your own bottle of wine or they do have beer
farmacy-knoxville-2,Judith I.,"Knoxville, TN",9/10/2017,5.0,"I have eaten at Farmacy three times and plan to continue to frequent this quirky place with a really good twist on breakfast.  I had the Rise and Shine twice and Dave's Eggs the third time, but substituted Sweet Potato Hash for the potatoes.  Yummy!The beignets were not as good as those at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans, or another restaurant in the Old City.  But service was excellent and seating both inside and outdoors was fine.This feels more like a restaurant you would find in the Old City.  That makes it especially appealing to me since it's in West Knoxville where funky is rare."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Joshua E.,"Knoxville, TN",6/4/2018,5.0,"I absolutely love to eat at Farmacy. It's so hard for me to order anything other the power bowl. It's so fantastic. I hear the brunch is something special, and it wouldn't surprise me a bit. That's the next thing on my punch list!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Aldo B.,"México, D.F., Mexico",2/4/2018,5.0,This place is always crowded because it is really good. Variety of gourmet sandwiches and dishes. Try Heart of Pixie but all are great.Soups are also good.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Marcy E.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",4/18/2019,5.0,"One of our very favorite places.  A bit small with an urban feel, and the food is awesome!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Sandra M.,"Knoxville, TN",5/16/2019,5.0,WOW!   Every dish was awesome!  Brisket was really terrific.  We will definitely return.  We'd surely like to try the brunch.   Delicious food!    Yum!!!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lauren B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/27/2019,5.0,I absolutely love this place. Their brunch is fantastic and so fun. Can't wait to try them for dinner.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Vanessa N.,"Norcross, GA",7/15/2017,3.0,"Dave's Eggs will come with any type of egg. Just don't ask for poached eggs. The eggs tasted like vinegar, and it was 90% overcooked egg white and 10% yolk, which was halfway cooked."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Susan B.,"White Plains, NY",4/10/2019,5.0,Don't let the strip mall location dissuade you from trying this place!  Incredibly fresh made-to-order food that dances in your mouth. I had the shrimp tacos and loved them. I will happily battle the same traffic on Northshore to come here again.  And again!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Crissi M.,"Charlotte, NC",7/1/2017,5.0,"We came at the perfect time! 11:15 in a Saturday. 5 minutes later it was packed! We ordered the Lemon Poppy Pancakes (with whipped cream cheese... yum!) and Chicken and Waffles. Both delicious and fresh!! The pancakes were light but filling. And chicken was moist, crispy with just the right amount of spice. The staff was wonderfully friendly and always around when we needed them. I can't wait to come back!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Mary M.,"Orange County, CA",5/11/2019,2.0,Tried this place this morning. Unimpressed. The food was actually good but the service was not. Overpriced and stuffy. Cheer up the staff and make prices a little more reasonable and it could be a nice spot.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Emma D.,"CONCORD FARR, TN",9/11/2019,1.0,The waiters and manager were extremely rude. Not understanding of health conditions. There were also stinks bugs on the walls. It's a very cute restaurant but the people working their are preventing me to go back.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Pam S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/13/2019,4.0,The service was great. Ordered avocado toast and fried green tomatoes and it was good. Service was quick but they were not busy. Will definetly be back to try something else. It is definitely worth a try!!!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jaime H.,"Knoxville, TN",3/31/2019,4.0,"Have always received wonderful service here. The food is delicious but in my opinion very overpriced for what you are getting. Ingredients are fresh and their different specialty drinks, like the strawberry lemonade, are excellent choices. If you don't mind spending some $ this place is a great local establishment to support."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jozie M.,"Maryville, TN",3/13/2020,3.0,Went for brunch. It was just ok. The seating is horrible and be prepared to share your conversation with everyone around you. There are better places than this one.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Stephanie L.,"Knoxville, TN",8/8/2018,4.0,"Pretty good but a little pricy! I understand the cost of fresh, farm to table food but you don't get much food--that being said, the food that you do get is delicious! Will probably be back!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Richard N.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2018,5.0,"This is probably the very best clean food restaurant.They make from the scratch and coming from local farm.... if you from Knoxville or visiting town... go try this place. Try the farmacy, vitality bowl and Nashville chicken....."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Mark K.,"Knoxville, TN",5/13/2018,1.0,"I never received the comp on my meal, which isn't a huge surprise since I never got the receipt, so just one star now."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Mark K.,"Knoxville, TN",4/15/2018,2.0,"I arrived just after lunch time on a Sunday, and all the tables were full and there were two groups in the queue to order. Nothing seemed too out of the ordinary, so I decided to stay and eat. It took about 10 minutes to get my order in: beignets, hot chicken, and a coffee. I originally just wanted hot chicken, but I spied the beignets on the menu and I had to try them. I took a seat in the waiting area and waited for an open table.The couple that came in behind me ordered and got seated immediately. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. They got a four topper, so that makes sense. A few minutes later, I was told that, if I was willing I could share a four topper. The four topper was really two tables made into a four topper. Cool. Cool, cool, cool.It looked like things were super busy for the staff, so I settled into catching up on the NBA playoff scores from the night before. The couple seated next to me (who came in after me), then note that the group of three who came in after all of us were getting their food. The young man very quietly stated this was ""Bullshit."" I didn't think it was a big deal because they ordered three orders of shrimp and grits and avocado toast. A server swung by to let us know that our orders were coming. Cool. Almost immediately after that, the couple seated next to me got their food: salad, and hot chicken and waffles. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. The couple that were in line in front of me got up. In the time I had ordered and sat down, they had received their food, eaten it, and were now headed for the door. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Some time later, a server stopped by and apologized that there was a snafu and a ""jam"" with tickets and my order was just put in. She stated that because of the long wait, my meal would be comped and she'd bring out a receipt to verify the refund. Never got that receipt. Sometime later, I got my ""chicken and waffles"" and as an apology for the delay, ""free beignets."" Except for the fact that I ordered them. And never got that receipt.As for the food, it's very good. The hot chicken has a sweet jalapeno sauce that is very tasty. The chicken itself was moist and just the right temperature. Unfortunately the fries were overcooked, salty, and soggy. The beignets are delicious, but fried dough has a tendency towards that.TL;DR: avoid peak hours, food is delicious."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jessica H.,"Lexington, KY",5/12/2018,5.0,"Been here twice! You have to order the fried green tomatoes! Game changer! The first time for lunch I ordered the fried green tomatoes as a starter. Today for lunch I tried The Stack as a starter. The Stack was bomb.com. Marinara, goat cheese, maybe basil and some other lovely combination of delicious. Order either but I will be ordering The Stack again for sure! Everything I've tried has been great!! My lunch date ordered the poppy seed pancakes. She said she wished they had a little more poppyseed or lemon flavoring. I tried a small bite & thought they were fabulous. You'll enjoy anything you order! I promise!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kohl T.,"Knoxville, TN",5/9/2018,5.0,"My wife and I have eaten at the Farmacy probably 4 times now, and will continue coming back! As far as fast casual restaurants (or any restaurant in Knoxville right now) the menu stands out as fresh and creative and the ingredients are definitely top quality. Think aged white cheddar on the mac and cheese, not yellow craft liquid-goo. I usually get the brisket which is melt-in-your-mouth awesome, and my wife gets the shrimp and grits. Then, we both get food envy and end up eating each others food. They do serve beer, but we like to stop at the liquor store around the corner and pick up a bottle of wine to bring in. They are a new restaurant and still have some kinks to work out, so if you try something that isn't perfect, or your service is slower, just tell your waiter so they can make it right. Overall, a very welcomed restaurant to the neighborhood that I'm sure will keep getting better with age!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Al J.,"Knoxville, TN",5/1/2018,4.0,"All the mixed reviews admittedly have put us off trying this local eatery, but our visit for dinner was a treat. We beat the rush so no issue getting seated. Well-organized, small enough to be intimate but open enough to be a little noisy. The food was very good. One of the staff stopped by to check on us a few times. Varied menu. Drink refills are self-serve and convenient. Glad we stopped in."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Amy H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4/28/2018,4.0,"Really like the Farmacy! Very impressed with the cute seating on the side/back of the restaurant. I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich & while I will say, that was way too spicy for me (I'd never had the infamous Nashville hot chicken dish before), it was still good. They warned me that it would ""kick me in the face"" & they were right. I wish they didn't have individual bottles for drinks, I'd rather have a fountain because bottles are so expensive. But overall, the Farmacy is reasonably priced, good quality, mostly local foods & does not disappoint. I will be back!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jennifer N.,"Gallatin, TN",4/24/2018,5.0,"Stopped in passing through town. It was a few miles off I-40, but definitely worth it. The turkey chili was hearty and delicious. The Brussels sprouts appetizer had a good flavor too. My husband had the pressed chicken and I the cure-all. We thoroughly enjoyed both. The cure-all (salmon) was light and flavorful. Would definitely go back to try something new. Oh, and they have a good selection of music playing."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",4/19/2018,5.0,"Best meal I had during my week stay in Knoxville! Came for lunch with coworkers and it's small and cozy inside. Great decor as well.Ordered the Southernaire with grilled chicken and a side of mac and cheese of course! It is a little pricey here, but great ingredients.The salad was amazing, had all the things I liked and with a fried egg! Felt very healthy! The mac and cheese was okay, too oily for my tasting.Will definitely be back!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Elon A.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",4/15/2018,5.0,"Loved loved loved this place! I'm so glad I found it, I might be here once a week if I get the time. The food here is delicious and the people are super nice! I ordered myself a healthy bowl because I'm doing Keto diet so I couldn't have the chicken and waffles but all my friends did and they loved it. The health now was also delicious I couldn't believe it, when I ordered it I was a little bummed out that I couldn't have all the good and yummy stuff but after my bowl came my friends were jealous of me they wanted my bowl. Anyway the chicken and waffles my friends said are top of the line and the Nashville chicken was delicious and spicy, they had this habanero sauce that was super spicy but also keeps you wanting more. I will definitely be back here soon. Check out my pics!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rita S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/15/2018,4.0,"Yet another spot to get your chicken and waffle fix. This is a small place with maybe 10 seating areas or so, so you can expect a line sometimes. I had to wait maybe 15 min before I had a seat. I had their chicken and waffles which I HEARD were amazing- but I think they were just okay, same thing you find at every other spot serving it. I ordered the Beignets but this too wasn't my favorite. They do have a good list of things one can order from, great service, cute place..."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Steve K.,"Knoxville, TN",4/12/2018,5.0,"Amazing food!!!   We found this small restaurant from a friend a few months ago and now eat here at least once a week.   My wife loves the Southernaire salad with salmon.   If we could drink the dressing with a straw we would.  I've tried the Farmacist, meat loaf but my all absolute favorite is the pepper crusted brisket.   It melts in your mouth....   This is a must for an incredible eating experience."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Steve K.,"Knoxville, TN",2/28/2018,5.0,this is my absolute favorite restaurant in Knoxville!  The brisket is incredible.... Could eat here every day.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rita P.,"Knoxville, TN",4/12/2018,5.0,"We just had lunch at the Farmacy and it was great! I had the strawberry salad  and chipotle tomato soup both were excellent. My husband loved his chicken sandwich also. Only negative was he ordered potato chips with it and should've gotten the salad! We are so glad to have a ""fresh ingredients"" restaurant close to us with a very cool atmosphere. If you are a foodie and understand fresh ingredients and inhouse made food then you are going to love this place. We have too few of this type restaurant in knoxville. Clearly I will be eating there often."

My husband loved his chicken sandwich also. Only negative was he ordered potato chips with it and should've gotten the salad! We are so glad to have a ""fresh ingredients"" restaurant close to us with a very cool atmosphere. If you are a foodie and understand fresh ingredients and inhouse made food then you are going to love this place. We have too few of this type restaurant in knoxville. Clearly I will be eating there often."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Julia C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/11/2018,2.0,"Gave this place a shot for lunch one day. I called ahead and ordered a Southernaire salad with grilled chicken to-go because my dog was with me. They said it would be 20 min. Okay no big deal. 20 minutes later I'm in the restaurant and it's not ready. Idk why a salad takes 20 min to throw together but still trying to give it the benefit of the doubt here. Get home and take the salad out, nice to-go container, extra dressing. Promising. But for a $15 price tag, pretty small. The worst part though was the size of the grilled chicken. I would estimate that before it was cut up, it was the size of one medium tender. Now, I realize that adding chicken is extra. I paid for it but judging by the amount, one would assume that it was included. I've NEVER seen such a small portion of chicken dished out as an add on. You're going to ask me to pay $15 for a salad + grilled chicken but not going to even give me enough meat for half the salad? For shame. Really grinds my gears. Overall, decent salad. Nothing to write home about. Certainly don't feel like I got my money's worth. Could have gotten way more bang for my buck (and twice the chicken) at a McAllister's or Jason's. Hopefully the rest of the menu at Farmacy lives up to the hype. I had high hopes because it looks like a cool place and I like the concept. I would rather give a small business a chance than spend my money at a chain restaurant but I was disappointed."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ian G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/8/2018,2.0,"Ordered the raw barely warm undercooked tasteless doughy kid size pancakes, with burnt crumbles of cold bacon, about an ounce of barely warm syrup in a tiny little metal vessel, and some cooked pears that probably would have tasted better if all the food was hot. I added an over medium egg and got an egg cooked over easy. This $5 breakfast cost about $13 and the comfort level of my food and our table and chairs was about zero. Definitely one of the worst atmospheres of any restaurant I've eaten at in Knoxville.My wife actually had a salad that looked half way decent. And the portion also looked about half the size compared to most other restaurants in town that make a similar salad for about the same price.  You know the mixed greens, strawberries, few pieces apple and I think there may have been a few walnuts or pecans in there and some feta. There was also a few pieces of chicken for an additional $4, I believe. The salad did look fresh and she liked it therefore not an abysmal rating. She definitely made a better choice than me but that's because she's smarter than me. Probably a real cook made her lunch and possibly an out of work pharmacist attempted to cook my lunch?Some of these small, pretentious, hipster cool, slick, restaurants will surprise you from time to time with creative, delicious,  interesting food but definitely not this place..."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Melissa C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/3/2018,3.0,"Tried this place for the first time today for lunch. I'm not sure if the ventilation in the kitchen doesn't work or they burned food, but the smell was very strong and overwhelming. My clothes and hair still smell like it 5 hours later. I ordered the Southernaire salad, I really liked the lemon asparagus dressing and croutons, but it was a bit expensive for the size and it took about 20 min to get just the salad. My pet peeve is they ask for a tip upfront when you pay with the order, they never asked me if I needed anything or if the food was good, I tip servers based on several factors, not because it's suggested when you order. I'm not sure I'd go back, really the smell of my clothing and hair is aggravating and obviously put me off, I had to go back to work and I was stinking up the office."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Laura H.,"Knoxville, TN",3/24/2018,4.0,"Cons: BYO Wine.....I didn't love that. I feel like that needs to be advertised on their website better (was it? Can't remember). They do have bottled beer which helped. Mine was not cold enough though.Pros: Yummy food for a decent price, kind staff, cute decor. Nutella cake was so huge and super yummy. I would go back....with my wine;)"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ann-Marie P.,"Knoxville, TN",3/17/2018,5.0,"We came here for Saturday brunch and the atmosphere was so darling! Shrimp and grits are YUM! And, we will definitely order the strawberry pecan salad when we come back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Sherissa S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3/17/2018,4.0,"Overall: 4.5/5 starsI feel like my husband and I have had lucky experiences because each time we've come to Farmacy, it's never been busy so service has been timely and food not rushed. Granted,  we've always come an hour before closing or after opening so I can't say much for busy times. Overall,  I feel Farmacy does a great job of using local ingredients to create flavorful dishes at a decent price. You're not paying for fast food or a fancy sit down, and the portions are a good size for what you pay for. Service has been ok,  not friendly, but not rude either. Food highlights:Beignets: warm, freshly fried dough that is extremely tasty.  The beignets are a grrat size for what you are paying. I liked the berry honey dipping sauce on the side too, the tartness complimented the sweetness of the dish *5/5Chicken waffles: Wow, the rosemary chicken was definitely the highlight here-moist and very flavorful! I would ask for syrup on the side because the waffles get soggy fast. *4/5Chicken tinga: basically a giant tostada with chicken, beans, corn, cheese,  an egg, and arugula on top. No real wow factor here,  but a good portion *3/5Hot chicken: again,  the highlight was the chicken- a whole lot of spicy sweetness that you had to keep eating, but the toast got soggy really fast with the yummy sauce *4/5BBQ plate: the dish wasn't horrible,  just mediocre. Honestly I enjoyed the biscuit the most in this dish because the pork seemed undersalted and lacked overall flavor without the sauce all over it. The potatoes were like a rich mash with some butter or cream-tasty, but really heavy. *3/5Chicken pot pie: I enjoyed the pastry puff as the ""crust,"" with the filling reminiscent of homemade pot pie, with elevated flavors. *4/5Burger: massive burger with onion rings and pimento cheese that is quite tasty, you can't go wrong with this!  Can easily serve two people! *4/5Desserts:  I've tried a variety of their desserts, and I have a massive sweet tooth!  Unfortunately, the flavors for their desserts tend to fall flat for me, as well as being overly sweetened.  Guess I'll have to get dessert elsewhere :( *2.5/5Since my husband and I live so close,  I can see Farmacy becoming a staple for a quick, tasty meal that is made with love!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Savannah C.,"Cookeville, TN",3/15/2018,2.0,"Do not go during high volume hours! My first visit was wonderful but the second visit has me questioning if I'll ever be back. After my meal I waited 15 more minutes for them to bring me something I had asked for BEFORE my meal. They were very overwhelmed and understaffed, they clearly cannot handle the restaurant at full capacity."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Alisha H.,"Hixson, Hixson, TN",2/25/2018,5.0,"This is my favorite place in all of Knoxville! The local ingredients and fun combos make this a great dinning choice. The piece points are great, because you are getting some amazing food! On the weekends make sure you try brunch."
farmacy-knoxville-2,William O.,"Knoxville, TN",2/21/2018,5.0,Arguably the best pork sandwich in town!  Great food at good prices.  I really appreciate Farmacy's commitment to source their food from local places.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Aldo B.,"México, D.F., Mexico",2/4/2018,5.0,This place is always crowded because it is really good. Variety of gourmet sandwiches and dishes. Try Heart of Pixie but all are great.Soups are also good.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Robert P.,"Alcoa, TN",2/4/2018,3.0,"Was excited to try this place and happy to see they were staying ooen for dinner when I drove by one day. Looked up their hours on a Sunday night, happy to see they were open and we loaded up and drove down only to find a hand written note taped to the door stating ""closed for Super bowl"". Off to soccer taco we go..."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Anna H.,"Knoxville, TN",1/7/2018,4.0,"So cute and the food is so good! I would have given it 5 stars, but I feel like it's in a weird location. I think it needs to be more in the downtown area. But the food is so good it's worth the longer drive."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rachel W.,"Knoxville, TN",1/3/2018,4.0,"This place is so cute! It's a very trendy vibe with lots of food options. The staff was friendly and helpful. They recommended the chicken and waffles, which were excellent."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/17/2017,2.0,"What a disappointment! Their biscuit looked so pretty but it was so dry. I tried using gravy to make it better but their gravy was similar to chili. Is biscuit with chili a thing? I discarded the biscuit and ate the insides of the farmacy sandwich. Besides the dry biscuit, the sandwich overall lacked flavor. I tried mixing it other dishes to give it flavor and nothing saved it. The chicken and waffle was the best choice on the menu. The chicken wasn't that crisp but still decent. I guess you can't go wrong with chicken and waffles. I also tried the soup, chipotle mac and cheese and chili which were all average."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jeff G.,"Knoxville, TN",12/16/2017,5.0,"I didn't know what to expect when I first visited Farmacy, I saw mixed reviews in here and people told me it's just like any other brunch spot. I am happy to say that what I heard was wrong on multiple fronts, it's not like any other spot nor is Farmacy is any longer brunch only. I ordered the beignets and chicken and waffles, I can't think of a better beignet that I've had in Knoxville. I plan on returning and possibly updating this review once I try their dinner menu"
farmacy-knoxville-2,B L.,"Cosby, TN",12/8/2017,1.0,"Honestly I have heard people rave about this new restaurant recently opened in Knoxville....I have to say that it was very disappointing to say the least. The service took forever, biscuits were undercooked and raw in the middle, and the Mac and cheese smelled like dirty socks. Maybe it was an off day, but the food tasted like it had been leftover from the day before. Unfortunately I will not be back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Charlie R.,"Knoxville, TN",12/6/2017,5.0,Such a great brunch and lunch stop! Couldn't be any happier with the service and food quality!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Nancy Y.,"Surfside Beach, SC",11/19/2017,4.0,I've wanted to try this for awhile. Intended to go to Scrambled Jakes. The wait was 1 to 1 1/4 hrs! Farmacy was on my list also. It was quite full but wait was only a few minutes. The breakfast menu wasn't extensive but has something for everyone. I got the eggs and bacon. Would have liked the potatoes a little crispier but they were very good. Biscuit was yummy. Howard's hot chicken and waffles made him sweat but he liked it!  Beignets was yummy. Overall nice breakfast for the price.  Would like to try lunch or dinner. They have a lot of comfort food listed. Overall liked it a lot!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Barbara K.,"Farragut, TN",7/15/2019,5.0,Absolutely love this place.  Just wish it was farther into west knoxville and closer to Farragut!  Would be there all the time!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Becky C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/27/2017,4.0,"We tried this place today for the first time. It was nice. I think it would have been nice if someone had explained to us how things worked.  You kind of have to figure things out on your own. I don't feel like you have enough time to decide what you want to eat. I also do not think that once you pick your food and pay for it, you're asked if you want to add a tip. How do you tip before you've even been served? The food was very good and the wait staff was very nice and checked on us often to make sure we were good. We will go back I'm sure. They still need some tweaking"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Carie B.,"Manhattan, NY",8/23/2017,5.0,Yum! I had the meatloaf special and was sooo amazing. The Tomato jam was fantastic. Each time I come it just gets better and better. I can't wait to see how this Up and coming Knoxville staple grows. Love this locally owned restaurant.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Greg G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/30/2018,3.0,"Our first experience was great, at least the food was. Service was meh. Ask a server for some hot sauce and she pointed to the condiment station. But, breakfast was great. Our second time was lunch. My brisket tacos were tasty but my wife's grilled pimento cheese and fried green tomato sandwich was not good. Tomato was not farm fresh.  Bread not great. I can make a better sandwich at home. Too bad, place has a lot of potential but needs to step up the service. Questionable if we will be back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Anne W.,"Knoxville, TN",9/30/2018,4.0,"Visited for Sunday afternoon lunch and enjoyed dining on the patio.  Food was excellent!  We had fried green tomatoes (gluten-free!), black & blue fries (super hot ... like Nashville hot-chicken hot!), and shared a maple-glazed salmon entree.  A little pricey but SO GOOD!  Would have given it 5-stars but the lady who rang up our order at the register had zero people skills and gave us blank stares when we asked questions about ordering.  Two other ladies checked on us, and provided great service. Looking forward to a return visit!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Ann-Marie P.,"Knoxville, TN",3/17/2018,5.0,"We came here for Saturday brunch and the atmosphere was so darling! Shrimp and grits are YUM! And, we will definitely order the strawberry pecan salad when we come back."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Nikki K.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2017,4.0,"Gave this place a visit and came in around 1 on a weekday and it was packed. I had the Nashville hot chicken. It was a generous portion and nice and juicy but I was hoping it would spicier. I can't comment on the sides because unfortunately, my meal did not come with any sides (unless you count texas toast.) I would have preferred to have half the portion of chicken and a side included for the price.  My wife ordered the Farmicist but we were told they ran out. I know this place is new and there are kinks to be worked out, but c'mon you run out of one of the top menu items from an already small menu?  The staff was very friendly and I liked the feel of the place although it is fairly tight seating. I will give this place another try simply because I know it's new and I'm sure the owner is still working out all the issues of opening a new spot."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Leigh Anne T.,"Knoxville, TN",10/4/2018,5.0,"Farmacy.....you have me. For starters there is this awesome dark haired manager that is always so sweet and offers to help with my every need when I'm alone with my two young girls. She's the best and i wish i knew her name. Second, i have been back like 6 times since my last review and they were all excellent visits with delicious food!! So happy they are a part of this community."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Leigh Anne T.,"Knoxville, TN",1/2/2018,2.0,"So i went back today for lunch because my parents wanted to try it out. It was still a not so great experience. I just don't feel like the people that work there are super friendly. The girl that was taking the orders was frazzled. I wanted to order the special of the day and sub the jalapeño baked beans out for fries because i just got over the stomach bug and she said it was a $3 upcharge she said it was different with daily specials. I respect that. No biggie. so i order the brisket meal with the mashed potatoes and they were out. Ugh...not my day there for sure. But she did suggest the french dip sandwhich so i said that's cool i will take that with fries. I got that and the kids chicken tenders meal and 2 waters and it was $20!! I was like for what? and she told me that $3 upcharge for fries again. I just feel like $3 is a steep upcharge but that's not my business i guess. Just wish she would've said that it was an upcharge on that one too. Just can't catch my groove there. The food was very good again. So that place is a catch 22 for me. After we ate my mom told me that while we were waiting at the front....the girl from the front was cleaning a table and my mom asked if she could sit there and the girl said ""no. It's for someone else. You can go back up front and wait for a table to open up."" I don't feel warm and fuzzy when i go there. I want so badly to feel it too. Maybe one more time???????        I wish I could give them 5 stars. I went with my friend and 2 year old and 8 mo old daughters. We got there around 1145 and I was pumped to only see 2 people in line. We walk in and see a sign that says order so we get a menu and get in line. When it's our turn I go first.....the girl was very sweet at the register but didn't ask us if we had been there before or explain how it all worked(which is the main reason why this review has 3 stars). I ordered the hot chicken and I'm still unsure if I actually got a side with it but I added fries because she said it was just chicken and Texas toast(I will get to how tiny the meal was later). I then decide on a cookie and water to drink. So she rings me up and hands me a number and glass full of ice. She did offer to help me to a table but I declined and set off on the rest of the unknown adventures. All of the tables were full and only high top tables left which I couldn't sit at with my 2 year old. I decided we would be fine at a 2 top so I sit and get my girls situated and my friend comes over with her water glass and number. I am looking for water and I see a little help yourself station and go over and there is tea and maybe a fruit tea or lemonade and coffee and a creamer type bottle. So I go back and sit and tell my friend there is no water there. Meanwhile a girl stops by our table and I asked her where we get our water from and she said well...the girl at the front is supposed to give it to you. And just looks at us and I said ok well she didn't. And she said we technically don't wait on you but I guess I can grab it for you. Uh thanks girl! Then she proceeds to tell us we bus our own table and the only they do is run the food. I'm fine with that but really wish it was explained and not told to us so point blank like that girl told us. I'm all about the concept of this restaurant. And how they run it but it needs to be more clear.  Now on to entree time. We are delivered our food. Me...the hot chicken and my friend got the spinach salad. Mine looks delicious. They did warn me how spicy it would be and it was that. So good! (I said earlier I wasn't sure if mine came with a side Or not but if it didn't it is not enough food for anyone). My 2 year old reached for a fry and spit it out. I'm not happy with her and I bite into them and sure enough they weren't done. So the girl finally walks by and we stop her and my friend ask for dressing (no apology on forgetting it) and I tell her the fries are underdone and she said do you want me to have them make you more? Something about this girl just rubbed me the wrong way from the beginning. I feel like she could've apologized and said I'm sorry I will get you more or something. Whatever....she brings my other batch of fries and it's the exact same situation. Underdone. I didn't feel like dealing with that girl again so I just didn't eat them and she didn't ask me about the 2 orders of uneaten fries in front of me. I want to try this place again and make this review 5 stars. It's close to my house, it's locally owned, and some of the other servers looked happy to be there. My cookie was very good! And I loved having a water bottle on the table. I drink a lot of water. I know the seating situation isn't the best but that's ok I can deal with that. They also had a big party with a lot of tables pushed together. I'm hoping maybe that server goes and finds another profession. And maybe they can explain how it works when you're ordering. It would be so much more helpful. I wish them good luck"

farmacy-knoxville-2,Justin D.,"Lenoir City, TN",6/7/2018,4.0,Let's start with the decor very welcoming and homey. Love the fresh plants every where. The menu is very nicely laid out with great descriptions of what you are getting. I had the brisket which I must say was probably one of the moister briskets I have ever had. Absolutely delicious. It was paired with a side of red mashed potatoes and tomato jam(to die for). I also got the chipotle mac which I was disappointed with. Although a great concept it was lacking of any kind of sauceness. Had plenty of cheese but just layered in top and looked like it was toasted or oven baked. All In all really great food great environment and great staff.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jessica H.,"Lexington, KY",5/12/2018,5.0,"Been here twice! You have to order the fried green tomatoes! Game changer! The first time for lunch I ordered the fried green tomatoes as a starter. Today for lunch I tried The Stack as a starter. The Stack was bomb.com. Marinara, goat cheese, maybe basil and some other lovely combination of delicious. Order either but I will be ordering The Stack again for sure! Everything I've tried has been great!! My lunch date ordered the poppy seed pancakes. She said she wished they had a little more poppyseed or lemon flavoring. I tried a small bite & thought they were fabulous. You'll enjoy anything you order! I promise!"

farmacy-knoxville-2,Mallory P.,"Tysons, VA",9/16/2017,4.0,"Cute little place west of Knoxville that feels like downtown. Local, farm fresh southern breakfast and lunch foods. If you're looking for the typical American portion size at Denny's prices, the bad reviews are right, this ain't the place. But, we got the Rise N' Shine sandwich (fried egg, bacon, avocado, pickels, stone ground mustard on a scratchmade biscuit with a side of sweet potato hash), the lemon poppyseed pancakes (topped with fresh berries, whipped cream cheese, and pistachios), two scrambled eggs, and two coffees for $30. It being our first time there, I would have liked some direction at the counter about how to order and where to get the self-serve coffee; and with a name like the Farmacy and decor that suggests local ingredients, I would have liked to see more info about where the food/coffee is from! But overall, I loved the atmosphere and the food was YUMMY. Happy to see another woman-owned business making a positive Mark here in Knoxville."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Joey G.,"Lenoir City, TN",9/3/2017,4.0,"Here I am at the Farmacy to try something new. I like the idea of decor trendy locations which do not overspend on buildout. However, as a process improvement engineer I do have an issue with waiting 17 minutes to order. When I asked what the issue was the response was, ""well normally we don't have a party that large."" (So did I come in at the wrong time?) Management please pay attention here!! It's not the size of party coming in to your restaurant which causes an issue. Two quick observations I made were:1).It's the input ordering process. 2).Having only one ordering station. The positive!!The kitchen was on point today. The Hot Chicken with Fries arrived within 7 minutes. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce had a touch of sweetness with a lingering spicy heat. Overall I loved the southern concept, quality food(especially Springer Farms Chicken), and friendly service. I would like for management to consider reviewing and testing their initial ordering process. There are many different ways to increase efficiency here which is the only reason those of us behind the ""big party"" were initially discouraged."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Steve K.,"Knoxville, TN",4/12/2018,5.0,"Amazing food!!!   We found this small restaurant from a friend a few months ago and now eat here at least once a week.   My wife loves the Southernaire salad with salmon.   If we could drink the dressing with a straw we would.  I've tried the Farmacist, meat loaf but my all absolute favorite is the pepper crusted brisket.   It melts in your mouth....   This is a must for an incredible eating experience."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Steve K.,"Knoxville, TN",2/28/2018,5.0,this is my absolute favorite restaurant in Knoxville!  The brisket is incredible.... Could eat here every day.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rita P.,"Knoxville, TN",4/12/2018,5.0,"We just had lunch at the Farmacy and it was great! I had the strawberry salad  and chipotle tomato soup both were excellent. My husband loved his chicken sandwich also. Only negative was he ordered potato chips with it and should've gotten the salad! We are so glad to have a ""fresh ingredients"" restaurant close to us with a very cool atmosphere. If you are a foodie and understand fresh ingredients and inhouse made food then you are going to love this place. We have too few of this type restaurant in knoxville. Clearly I will be eating there often."

farmacy-knoxville-2,Jena J.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",11/18/2018,3.0,Subpar food and lousy service. Unfortunate given we love supporting local places. We've given this place 2 times and yet has yet to amaze us. If it's busy I would pass this place.
farmacy-knoxville-2,Pate M.,"Nashville, TN",9/3/2017,1.0,"Went for Sunday brunch and didn't stay. We are vegan and only thing on menu we could eat was avocado toast which sounded good but we were looking for something more substantial. Disappointed as we had read about them and were excited to try. Omnivores probably will love this place, and maybe even vegetarians with some adaptions, but vegans have little reason to go."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Holly R.,"Knoxville, TN",10/23/2017,5.0,"So cute! Perfect little lunch spot.  Deciding on what to order was so difficult--the whole menu sounded amazing! I had a fried green tomato blt and boyfriend had hot chicken and waffles.  While we waited, we ate our desert--a huge chocolate chip cookie!  The owner brought out our meals, which were beautifully plated.  Both were delicious! I wish I had taken pictures.  I don't understand the one star review above complaining about portion size -- we were both very full after our meals -- I don't know what this girl was expecting -- maybe she should dine at establishments like Cracker Barrel where you get a huge plate of lower quality food? I appreciate restaurants that are conscious of what they serve -- and that is why you might pay a little more.  In case you didn't know, now you know.  Big portions at small prices=low quality food full of artificial ingredients, chemicals, etc.  anyways.  My boyfriend loved it so much he ordered a chicken biscuit togo for later.  The owner is an absolute doll -- she brought out our food and even comped our Togo order after hearing we had evacuated from Florida during hurricane Irma.  Thank again, we will be back!!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Harrison M.,"Knoxville, TN",5/17/2018,4.0,"The most important thing to know about our experience at Farmacy is that the food is very good, and the menu is unique and creative. I was a bit worried they would be able to execute with such a vast menu of unique dishes, but they did. The hot chicken is delicious, but very spicy, as a heads up. The beignets are great, as well. I'm looking forward to trying their barbecue options. We went for brunch on a Sunday at 11:00 a.m. The ordering process was a little quirky. You order at the counter, and provided there are empty tables, this would work fine. However, we were third in line for an open table when we arrived, so we had to wait in line to order so that our food wouldn't be ready before we sat down. Farmacy has a few kinks to iron out when it is that busy; we had to ask multiple times about the ingredients of a dish due to a food allergy, and our friends' high chair was removed when one of them took him outside when he got a little antsy. We didn't notice until he brought the little guy back to the table, and they evidently didn't have anymore high chairs after that one was given to another customer. Nevertheless, I will go back (maybe at a less busy time) to give it another shot, because the food was that good, and the staff was apologetic and kind when something fell through the cracks. So I'm pulling for them."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Mark K.,"Knoxville, TN",5/13/2018,1.0,"I never received the comp on my meal, which isn't a huge surprise since I never got the receipt, so just one star now."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Mark K.,"Knoxville, TN",4/15/2018,2.0,"I arrived just after lunch time on a Sunday, and all the tables were full and there were two groups in the queue to order. Nothing seemed too out of the ordinary, so I decided to stay and eat. It took about 10 minutes to get my order in: beignets, hot chicken, and a coffee. I originally just wanted hot chicken, but I spied the beignets on the menu and I had to try them. I took a seat in the waiting area and waited for an open table.The couple that came in behind me ordered and got seated immediately. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. They got a four topper, so that makes sense. A few minutes later, I was told that, if I was willing I could share a four topper. The four topper was really two tables made into a four topper. Cool. Cool, cool, cool.It looked like things were super busy for the staff, so I settled into catching up on the NBA playoff scores from the night before. The couple seated next to me (who came in after me), then note that the group of three who came in after all of us were getting their food. The young man very quietly stated this was ""Bullshit."" I didn't think it was a big deal because they ordered three orders of shrimp and grits and avocado toast. A server swung by to let us know that our orders were coming. Cool. Almost immediately after that, the couple seated next to me got their food: salad, and hot chicken and waffles. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. The couple that were in line in front of me got up. In the time I had ordered and sat down, they had received their food, eaten it, and were now headed for the door. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Some time later, a server stopped by and apologized that there was a snafu and a ""jam"" with tickets and my order was just put in. She stated that because of the long wait, my meal would be comped and she'd bring out a receipt to verify the refund. Never got that receipt. Sometime later, I got my ""chicken and waffles"" and as an apology for the delay, ""free beignets."" Except for the fact that I ordered them. And never got that receipt.As for the food, it's very good. The hot chicken has a sweet jalapeno sauce that is very tasty. The chicken itself was moist and just the right temperature. Unfortunately the fries were overcooked, salty, and soggy. The beignets are delicious, but fried dough has a tendency towards that.TL;DR: avoid peak hours, food is delicious."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jennifer N.,"Gallatin, TN",4/24/2018,5.0,"Stopped in passing through town. It was a few miles off I-40, but definitely worth it. The turkey chili was hearty and delicious. The Brussels sprouts appetizer had a good flavor too. My husband had the pressed chicken and I the cure-all. We thoroughly enjoyed both. The cure-all (salmon) was light and flavorful. Would definitely go back to try something new. Oh, and they have a good selection of music playing."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Leah L.,"Birmingham, AL",6/23/2018,3.0,"Okay so the atmosphere is really cute. Cute, clean, and earthy design. You walk in and order then you go sit down. Nice customer services, but they do up sale you on the biscuits. (The most dense biscuits you ever going to eat) My sister order chicken tikka (it was amazing) and beignet (they were kinda bland). I order a ice coffee (it was fine) and chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles were very disappointing. They weren't bad but the chicken had weird flavor on it throwing off the hole taste. Between my sister and I we spent 40 dollars which was a little on the expensive side for what we got. It's a cute little place but for the price I am not sure it was worth it. Maybe we will come back for the lunch menu."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Kat W.,"New York, NY",10/19/2017,5.0,"In town from Austin, Texas and was looking for some vegetarian places to eat. We decided to eat here after landing at the airport. I ordered the a bunch of side. I got the side salad which was okay. I also got the fried green tomatoes and those were sooooo good! The best fried green tomatoes I've gotten. It also came with a biscuit and the biscuit was really good! I loved it. I also got the mac n cheese and thought it was pretty good. My boyfriend got the chicken pesto sandwich and he said it was okay but he wouldn't get it again. I thought the place was really cute and well decorated!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Melissa C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/3/2018,3.0,"Tried this place for the first time today for lunch. I'm not sure if the ventilation in the kitchen doesn't work or they burned food, but the smell was very strong and overwhelming. My clothes and hair still smell like it 5 hours later. I ordered the Southernaire salad, I really liked the lemon asparagus dressing and croutons, but it was a bit expensive for the size and it took about 20 min to get just the salad. My pet peeve is they ask for a tip upfront when you pay with the order, they never asked me if I needed anything or if the food was good, I tip servers based on several factors, not because it's suggested when you order. I'm not sure I'd go back, really the smell of my clothing and hair is aggravating and obviously put me off, I had to go back to work and I was stinking up the office."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jamie M.,"Columbus, OH",8/6/2017,4.0,"I came here during a weekend brunch and I was pleasantly surprised, but have a few criticisms. First the atmosphere is quaint but small I wish they had a bigger space and hopefully in the future maybe expand. The staff was very friendly and helpful asking frequently if we needed anything. I tried the Farmacist sandwich, which I was very surprised with. I got the biscuit on the side with pimento cheese and swapped out the chips for sweet potato hash available during weekend brunch. I was blown away by the size of the biscuit. It was bigger than my fist and it was amazing! The pimento cheese was homemade and also very flavorful. You could tell the ingredients were top notch. I wished the sweet potato hash was my crispy, it seemed to be cooked on low heat but they were also decent and I did like the jalapeños that were seasoned with them. I also got the strawberry cake to-go. I love strawberry cake and it was described as having buttercream and cream cheese frosting mix. It seemed to be much more buttercream frosting than cream cheese. I was slightly disappointed as I am not a huge buttercream frosting fan but if you do like it then you are sure to love it. I enjoyed the real strawberries you could taste and see within the cake and frosting. As much as I loved my meal, I wish the menu had more to offer. I am not sure it is small because it is a new restaurant but the brunch menu lacked an omelet, benedicts and other breakfast staples. The regular menu is also limited to a couple sandwiches and main plates. I would love to see what they could create with more options. I recommend this place as a great lunch option in the West knox area that isn't some gross chain!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Jacob L.,"Louisville, KY",10/23/2017,5.0,"Great little place! Amazing food! If you live in the Knoxville area, then you have to try this place. Sunday brunch is amazing!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Christopher M.,"Knoxville, TN",11/19/2017,4.0,"First time in, grabbed lunch.   Chicken & spinach enchiladas were tasty.   Wife had the Chili, which was also a good meal.  Two things,  tables are a little close together and drinks are by the bottle or can.  There is no soda dispenser, so no free refills.   We would go back ageing.   They just started a dinner menu last Thursday,  so we are gung to make that happen."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Steph L.,"Knoxville, TN",10/23/2017,5.0,Amazing food! Fun and beautiful atmosphere. I have eaten here a few times and everything has been good!

the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Michael R.,"Cary, NC",7/23/2022,5.0,Freaking amazing. Will be back every visit to Knoxville. Food and atmosphere are both next level. And the cocktails...
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Thomas T.,"Northfield, IL",7/18/2022,5.0,"Oysters in Tennessee?! Heck, yeah!  This place is amazing!  The shuckers and great oysters make it so. If you like oysters, a great atmosphere, and just generally good conversation about oysters you should not miss this place."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,John M.,"Maryville, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,"We were joined here by friends for dinner and ended just working our way through the hot and cold apps until we couldn't eat anything else. Never made it to entrees or desserts. The various oysters that made up our 2 1/2 dozen were wonderful. My personal favorite were the Savage Blonde from PEI. The Oyster's Rockefeller were  exceptional and unlike any I've previously enjoyed. Rounding out the oyster portion of the evening were Oyster Shooters (a first for me). These could be dangerous they go down so easily. Among other incredible apps were the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Lobster Dip with Shrimp Chips. Our server, Fallon, was a delight. She kept a watchful eye on our glasses and plates. Additionally, she was very knowledgeable, answering all of our questions. Can't for our next visit, maybe we'll start with the entrées."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Colleen R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/31/2022,5.0,"My friend and I met for an early reservation on a Saturday night. It's not a large restaurant, so reservations via Resy are a must.  We were seated right away at a cozy two-top table/booth, and the server was ready to review their specific oyster menu with us. We saved her the trouble there, we ain't oyster people, but if you are then you'll need to check this place out and then let me know what you think!They have several signature cocktails on the menu, and by GOD if you're going to list a martini then I'm going to get one. Ketel one, dirty, with whipped blue cheese stuffed olives this drink was GLORIOUS. And to top it off their bar ware is just lovely. My friend ordered the Living on a Pear, she enjoyed it although she did think it was a bit on the sweet side.We split two appetizers - the whipped feta and the smoked fish dip.  Both delicious but let me just do you a solid and say you HAVE to order the whipped feta. Creamy with a hint of heat and sweet, served with grilled sour dough bread LAWDHAVEMERCY. Since both of the apps were pretty sizable an each served with bread, we ordered small for our entrees. I had the Spanish grilled octopus - it was petite and lovely, not chewy. It had a nice flavor although nothing over the top. Served on a plate of puréed white bean, which was also tasty, but I didn't necessarily think the two related to one another. That said i'd still order it again.  My friend had the chilled shrimp and loved them.  When we left around 8:00 the restaurant was packed. Our server was adorable and she did an outstanding job.  I'll be back Brass Pearl - my 14 year old is def gonna want to try your mussels!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Mike And Nita B.,"Bettendorf, IA",5/5/2022,5.0,The shrimp and grits were excellent and worth the visit just for that.  Also enjoyed the Lobster Bisque.Nice ambiance and fast friendly service.Next time to Knoxville I would make it a point to eat here again!
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,JH C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",8/27/2022,5.0,This place is just a top notch! Our server Jake was very nice and wonderful!All the food on menu sounded so good and three of us tried few which turned out to be all very delicious and quality was excellent!  Very satisfying dinner we had tonight.
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Jared M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/5/2022,5.0,"Was so glad to get to go on the opening weekend!- Oyster bar was fresh and tried two of them all (plus a couple more).- Venue looks really nice with good touches. - Food came out fresh and tasted amazing!Agree on reviews talking about prices, but do go give it a chance! Will definitely be back."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Macy D.,"TN, TN",5/16/2022,5.0,"This place is such a neat little addition to Market Square! We went to celebrate an anniversary and loved our experience. Since it's pretty new, it was very crowded and I would definitely recommend making a reservation. The drinks are unique, and we really enjoyed the crab dip as an appetizer. The lobster mac and cheese was very creamy and filling- enough to take home for sure. The fish and chips were my favorite! Well battered and the sauce they give you with it in addition to the tartar sauce was very tasty. The maritime decor and atmosphere is super fun and different than anything in the area. It is a narrow and relatively small restaurant, so be expecting to sit very close to your neighbors especially if you go on a weekend! Would love to go back and try some different things on the menu."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Chris O.,"Knoxville, TN",4/22/2022,5.0,"Updated to add:Still 5 stars. Have not had anything regrettable here. Was able to try to feta dip now and although it's good, the lobster dip is still my favorite. Fried oysters were a bit on the spicy side but a nice starter. Oysters Rockafeller didn't disappoint if you're like me and can't do plain raw oysters. If you ask for bread, they have what tasted like charred sourdough. Great with the bisque.Tried chocolate cake and crème brûlée cheesecake and would definitely take the cheesecake over the chocolate. G&T is listed as seaweed infused but it is very subtle if at all noticeable. Tasted like a basic gin and tonic to me! I have been trying to taste some of the other items on the menu but can't get past the specials they offer. Had amazing snapper the last time and the most recent visit got the swordfish - which I wish was a regular menu feature.Can't stop won't stop!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Chris O.,"Knoxville, TN",3/17/2022,5.0,"Thrilled I get to award this place 5 stars!! It was the perfect date night and we were impressed with everything: drinks, food, atmosphere and service. Can't wait to go back and try everything we missed.Brass Pearl reminds me of a place in New York - very narrow and extending far back with cozy booths next to each other. The octopus chandelier was my favorite part of the decor. Music playing was classic rock with Gimme Shelter vibes.Salt Bae was a DELICIOUS cocktail. And was a generous portion in a tall glass with a cute umbrella. Also tried the whipped blue cheese stuffed olive dirty martini and it was executed perfectly. Lobster dip - would definitely get this again. The crackers and cheesy dip were the perfect pair. Lobster bisque - really good. More on the creamy side with great flavor. Kale Caesar Salad - such a unique combination that just works. The sardines at the top were a little daunting but I thought it was dressed evenly and was a generous portion. Steak Frites - hard to go wrong with a steak and fries: especially when it comes with fried onions on top. Aioli dip was good too but a little on the salty side. Lobster Mac and Cheese - a great dish. Exactly what you'd expect. Lumps weren't especially big but definitely flavorful. Pasta was orecchiette shaped and it was a tad on the spicy side but not overwhelmingly so. Felt a bit guilty not ordering oysters so the plan for our next visit will include oysters Rockafeller, Pearl salad and key lime pie or the crème brûlée cheesecake. Great that they take reservations too. Can't wait for next time."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Charlie H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/23/2022,5.0,"We had a great dinner of oysters, octopus, lobster dip, lobster Mac and cheese and fish and chips.  Oysters were ice cold, octopus cooked to perfection,  fish and chips best in Knoxville! Service was great!!!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Melody J.,"Chesapeake, VA",4/12/2022,5.0,"We came here around 4pm as we were walking by in the Market Square. We sat at the bar and ordered Oysters, Lobster dip, and Fish Sticks - all of which were tasty and savory. Anna served us some local brews and talked us through the oyster selection. This has a great happy hour vibe, there was a variety of people dressed up and some with their UT gear on, so come as you are and you'll fit in :)Their dinner menu looked scrumptious! I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some more entrees. Yum!!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Caroline W.,"Knoxville, TN",6/30/2022,5.0,"We had a great girls' night at The Brass Pearl! Our waitress was incredibly helpful in describing the food and helping us decide between the great options. The Spanish octopus and mussels were phenomenal--they both had a little kick to them. The shrimp and grits was probably the best I've ever had. The rue had a Smokey Cajun taste which complimented the sausage and shrimp, but didn't overpower them. To top it off, we had the key lime pie which was light and perfect. We can't wait to go back!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Sylvia R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/14/2022,5.0,"What a wonderful dining experience, albeit a bit pricey. The evening began with our server Lily, who was quite lovely and very attentive.  Our drinks and meals were presented in a fashion that was pleasing to the eye and palate.  The shrimp and grits were amazing and perfectly prepared. The portions were generous and the drinks were spot on!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Donald R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/14/2022,4.0,"My wife and I had a reservation with another couple to try this restaurant out.  We were seated immediately in a booth.  The restaurant is small, and it's bit on the noisy side.  The staff and server provided excellent service throughout the meal.  Our server explained the daily specials.  We didn't need the oyster selection explanation. We ordered drinks (I had a Sauvignon blanc), and moved on to the menu. The menu is very limited, but still had a number of items I like.  I had their Pearl Salad with grilled shrimp.  There was plenty of salad with just the right amount of dressing, and the right amount of delicious grilled shrimp (I didn't count them.) The salad, overall, was very good.  My wife had their shrimp and grits.  Her portion was enough to take home.  Our fellow diners opted for each of the daily specials, filet mignon and Chilean Sea Bass.  Our server checked on us just the right amount of time.  And, despite it being a Saturday night, we never felt rushed.  I felt the prices were high for the food and the experience.  However, we would return when in the mood for seafood."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Caitlin C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/9/2022,5.0,Knoxville's newest restaurant is delicious! The oysters were very fresh and my chefs special was as well. We had a great waitress named Hannah. Wasn't busy on a Sunday nice which worries me a bit. I'll be back to try the lobster Mac and cheese.
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Y. G.,"Dallas, TX",3/2/2022,5.0,"This new seafood place is a must try! If you like  raw oysters, you need to come here!!! Sorry, I didn't get pictures of my oysters cause I ate them too quickly...they were that fresh and good. My partner got the special, which was the snapper and risotto...he loved it!!! Mine was the fisherman's stew and risotto...I wish it had skinny noodles instead. I also got the salt bae and it was so good; must have been the bartender!! Yummy to this place!!! Did I mention those oysters!!! Oh goodness were they good!!! I wish they would open for at least 2 hrs during lunch, cause I would go there just for the oysters and drinks!!!!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Sammy O.,"San Francisco, CA",3/5/2022,5.0,"Well Done Brass Pearl!!Your not a cheap date, but love your concept, Just what we needed here in Knoxville!!Nothing makes me happier than a glass of bubbly rose and some fresh oysters!!  We tried a few other items on the menu as well and everything was delicious!! The decor is fresh, hip and love the ode to Wes Anderson's film The Life Aquatic!! My tip if you get mussels ,just go ahead and ask for extra bread , your going to want it to sop up every last drop of the delicious broth! Looking forward to our next visit!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Lexi S.,"Powell, TN",3/8/2022,4.0,"Great atmosphere, great food, and a great time! The decor and menu really give you a vibe like you're at the beach!

the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Christopher H.,"Knoxville, TN",2/25/2022,5.0,I mean wow. Food was fantastic. Service was even better. Lexi answered all of my questions thoroughly. Not only did I leave inspired by the food. I felt like I had learned something new. Cannot recommend this spot more.
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Graham C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/21/2022,5.0,"Can't say enough about this place. Everything was terrific. The service was friendly and plentiful. Everything we tried we wanted more of... oysters of course, the feta, fried oyster and the fish & chips. Both specials, a sea bass and the surf & turf we remarkable. Don't skip the key lime pie!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Jason W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/31/2022,5.0,Lovely atmosphere with a small menu of items they know how to do consistently well. It's a great spot for a date night.
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Deborah L.,"Centreville, VA",3/14/2022,4.0,"New restaurant in downtown Knoxville!!Highly recommended to make a reservation on weekends as it was very crowed on Sunday 8PM.We ordered Lobster Dip for an appetizer which was flavorful and very satisfying. Kale Caesar , bit over dressed but yummy!!  Fisherman's Stew was somewhat disappointing :( I liked the bread that came with more than the dish itself. It lacked flavor and had weird texture. Not sure lobsters were fresh. The waiter was friendly and kind. Afterall, it is a new restaurant so maybe Its worth going to try it for yourselves."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Kyle Adams A.,"Knoxville, TN",2/27/2022,4.0,This oysters here were so good. The best I've had in Knox and I'm super picky about oysters! However the cocktails tasted strange we got the Salt Bae and the Ship Faced and I just didn't care for either one. It's pretty pricey also I dropped $100 on two people. Definitely a special occasion place!
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Wendy H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/18/2022,5.0,Very happy with our dining experience! Wonderful staff and excellent food. Love the atmosphere. Will definitely come back soon and try more of the menu items and cocktails.
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Andrew S.,"Knoxville, TN",6/3/2022,5.0,Yep. This is the spot for you if you love Oysters and Champagne. What a fantastic addition to Market Square. Cannot recommend this place enough.

kaizen-knoxville-2,Jenifer F.,"Knoxville, TN",8/23/2022,5.0,"We've been here a dozen times or more and it's always great. The pork belly fried rice is my favorite but sometimes I have to have the chef's special of the night.The pork egg rolls are also a taste explosion. The outdoor patio is HUGE and it's hidden from the street almost completely.Lots of Knoxville charm and incredibly good food. Oh, and their drink specials never disappoint.Choose this place, you'll not regret it."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jessica S.,"TN, TN",9/2/2022,3.0,"This place has been recommended to me since 2018, I finally went and unfortunately have to agree with the other reviews regarding price point and general satisfaction with the food.Pros-The ambiance is very modern, cute, and quirky. Fun wallpaper and a dark interior and optional outdoor seating if weather permits. Friendly service. Bao/buns were excellent, if I ever came back I'd just stick to those. The pork belly one and the eggplant one were just as good as everyone said they would be.Cons- I can't come back for this price point. The pork belly fried rice was presented beautifully, but this dish was 80% rice. You can't charge $18 for 80% rice which costs actual mere cents and not even mix pieces of pork belly into the rice. The pork belly and other toppings were delicious, but not enough to justify this pricing."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Anwesh D.,"Memphis, TN",6/15/2022,4.0,"After hearing great things about the place, I decided to try Kaizen. The steamed buns were small but very delicious. I would recommend getting multiple orders to try out the different varieties.The Pad Thai, the fried rice were also solid entrees. Overall, definitely the best Asian restaurant in Knoxville. Worth a try!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Alex L.,"Las Vegas, NV",5/13/2022,4.0,"When I was eating there, I thought hmm it's not bad, but not sure if it's like good as I was told. But after a day I found myself wanting to eat here again! P.S. The portions are deceivingly large."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Valerie U.,"Placerville, CA",8/4/2022,3.0,"Not kid friendly. They sat us outside and gave my 3 yr old a drink in a glass. Nothing on the menu is kid friendly, unless your kid loves spicy food. My daughter ate steamed rice. Our food was delicious, but service was slow so we didn't see our server until she was bringing the check. No refills or extra napkins."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Luke S.,"Clinton, TN",8/19/2022,5.0,"Arguably Knoxvilles best restaurant based on the food quality, variety, and freshness.   Wait staff are pretty good.   Come for the food."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Matthew L.,"Central, SC",8/11/2022,5.0,Food was great. I had the crispy beef dish and my wife had the shrimp bowl. Service could have been better.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Thuy Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",3/2/2022,4.0,"Great vibes.Sat on the patio with cute string lights and a cool, clean alley feel. The food was pretty reasonably priced and relatively delicious. Some items were really hit or miss though. The dumplings, yummy. The braised potatoes we had- wayyyy too salty sitting in a pool of soy sauce/tamari. The dry fry eggplant is a MUST. Crispy, tingly, well spiced, so good. The Dan Dan noodles we knew were served cold- expected them cool but not straight out of the fridge cold. The mapo tofu is definitely not standard- both mapo and Dan Dan are known for being saucy dishes authentically but both dishes were served saucless.The mapo had dry black beans on top and no sauce which made it not the most pleasant eating experience, although the flavors did have good depth and tingle from the sichuan peppercorns."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Matt R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/15/2022,5.0,"Amazing experience! This was the first time that my boyfriend and I went to Kaizen. Our experience was fantastic as the service was fast and the vibe of the whole restaurant was on point. The food we ordered was all hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious! We sat at the bar, even though some tables were still open when we got there around 5 on a Friday. The bartenders are very quick to serve us and helped a lot in our decision making of what to order for food and drinks. We will definitely be coming back again to try out many more of the menu items, since they all looked delicious. The place filled up fast after we got there so make plans to get there early! Would absolutely recommend for anyone in the area to try out."
kaizen-knoxville-2,John H.,"New York, NY",6/28/2021,4.0,The eggplant is all she wrote.  It is like eating fries on crack.  Great seasoning (five-spice with anise coming through).  CRISPY!  I had better Dan Dan noodles elsewhere  but it was still good.  It was drier than other versions I've had.  Evenings can get quite busy.  Also it can be a noisy spot.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Susan C.,"Fort Worth, TX",12/6/2021,4.0,"We finally got the chance to try this place. They have a spacious outdoor seating area, which we enjoyed. We ordered the bang bang shrimp and Thai sausage steamed buns for apps. I preferred the shrimp one over the sausage but both were good. As entrees we ordered the Thai chicken noodles and the pork belly fried rice. The fried rice only had 3 pieces of pork belly. In my opinion, not enough for all the rice it came with, which is why I gave 4 stars. Doubling the pork belly would have been perfect, but it was still very good. My only regret was having so much rice leftover since I ran out of meat. The rice was very crispy, like it was cooked in a clay pot. Overall good place and I would definitely recommend and would come back to try other dishes."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Karen B.,"North Park, Chicago, IL",4/3/2022,4.0,"We lucked out with a free parking space right in front so we knew we were off to a good start. We were very hungry and since there were no available tables and we thought it too cold to eat outside we sat at the bar. Rachael the bartender was outstanding. We ordered goyza (too greasy), egg rolls (different and not our favorite) bang bang shrimp steamed bun (great!) Thai sausage steamed bun (good) beef and basil noodle stir fry ( really good) and Dan Dan noodles (good). But the decor, ambiance and conversation with others at the bar made for a great experience"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Nishtha S.,"San Francisco, CA",4/18/2022,5.0,Really delicious and fancy food options! Great Asian and especially some must try Sichuan items!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Molly K.,"Knoxville, TN",5/25/2022,5.0,"Kaizen is one of the best Japanese spots in Knoxville! Decorated with a selection of interesting posters and funky decor, it's a cozy and inviting indoor seating area. Even though they raised the prices of their steamed buns (they used to be 2 for 5), I always get one to accompany my meal. During my last visit I ordered the bang bang shrimp fried rice and they gave me a delicious and gigantic portion, big enough for me to split into two meals. I always recommend kaizen to anyone who asks."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Meagan N.,"Shelby, NC",6/22/2022,5.0,This was such a cool spot to visit for dinner. The aesthetic inside was a perfect fit for the food. I ordered the bao buns as an appetizer and they didn't last long on my plate. The pork belly bowl was fantastic and so large I couldn't finish all of my fried rice at the bottom. Overall a fantastic place to visit and highly recommend!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Carole M.,"Tucker, GA",4/19/2022,5.0,Great atmosphere Indoor and big backyard patio available All staff we came across was super friendly Fast service but not rushedGreat foodThere is a parking lot across the street- we were walking The buns are good- portion for one- you wont want to share so good they areOctopus fried balls were a little blend and mushy to our taste- but octopus is blend to start withThe pho was perfect spice - can be shareHighly recommend
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jackie V.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",7/21/2021,5.0,We had a yummy dinner here during a weekend visit to Knoxville. We sat at the bar. We started with the Thai sausage Bao bun which was ready. Then I had the shrimp curry with coconut rice. This was very good. It was different than a normal curry- shrimp were lightly breaded and the curry was more of a brown sauce. But it was fresh and tasty. My husband had the lamb noodles and he raved about them. This is a great dinner spot if you are looking for something casual and delicious.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Felix T.,"Orlando, FL",1/22/2022,5.0,"Kaizen was a really good experienceWe got a chance to go while on a trip to Knoxville for some wedding planning. It was very cold that day so we thought some warm Asian food would be very nice. Once we came in, we got a chance to have our pick at seating, which was nice as there was only one other couple there when we came in. The location itself is fun, and gives a nice vibe, the bar is a little further tucked back, but generally we don't eat at the bar anyway. Our server was pretty great and gave us some great recommendations. We didn't have any cocktails or beer, but we did have Sake. The Cedar Sake was recommended so we had a room temp, this, was a fantastic choice. (Note: they do NOT have hot sake, they are individually bottled Sake and don't warm well) We got two specials, that unfortunately I can remember the name, so I'll do my best to describe them. First, was a Stir fried noodle, almost like a dry ramen. It has some very tasty veggies, pork and noodles, hands down delicious. It did leave my mouth warm, just something to note if you don't like spicy. The server will tell you though. Next we're the dumplings, these guys took the show. They were very well made, had nice presentation and tasted phenomenal. Make sure you dip them in the sauce for full effect. Finally we got a side kimchi, it was pretty standard, this I didn't get to finish as I got full. Overall, I highly recommend Kaizen, especially on a cold day in Knoxville. On another note, don't sit by the door when it's cold like I did"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Michelle R.,"Knoxville, TN",4/1/2021,5.0,"One of the best restaurants in Knoxville -- especially for vegetarians. They're very accommodating and can make almost any dish vegetarian if you ask. I recently had the chilled dan dan noodles with tofu and my husband had the mapo doufu. Both were spicy and delicious. The eggplant bun is an absolute must. I get it every time I eat here or order takeout and it never disappoints. Finally, I love the new location. The old location was great too but the dining room and patio were so small that it was always a long wait for a table. This new spot has tons of patio seating, though indoor seating is still limited. I love how it looks in there though -- the wallpapers are gorgeous."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Nick A.,"Homeworth, OH",11/24/2021,5.0,Absolutely the best dumplings I've ever had. The pork belly fried rice was delicious and the pork belly was cooked to perfection. Definitely a great place to stop for lunch or supper.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Rose C.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",6/19/2021,4.0,"I will agree with the reviewers who said this is one of the best in Knoxville for vegetarians and vegans, I came here with my vegan cousin and she found many things that she really enjoyed! I got the Nashville Man Bun (very good but very spicy!), the pork belly bun (loved it!), the katsu bun (also very tasty, nice crunch), and the Thai sausage bun (really tasty)! We split the tamari glazed potatoes which were also amazing! I was not personally a huge fan of their drinks, I got boulevard pear yuzu spiked and the chu-hi grapefruit soju soda, and didn't love either."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Marty M.,"Cookeville, TN",6/2/2021,1.0,"Don't understand the high reviews for this place but I will never go back. Ordered the dumplings as an appetizer, $6 for 4 ""dumpling cups"", (see picture), a mouthful of dumpling dough with a scant amount of filling.On to the entree of Orange Chicken Lo Mein, maybe 5 small pieces of chicken in a thick, cloyingly sweet/ heavy sauce with a few veggies, AWFUL!  Waitress never asked how the food was even though I left 3/4 of it. Then I get my bill for $26 , hand her my card, when I get the copy to sign it is a bill for $96. Supposedly she corrected this mistake( with NO apology), I'll wait for my statement to see. Maybe a bad nite, it happens, but won't be back. Should've gone to PF Chang's, and I abhor chains."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Maddie B.,"TN, TN",3/22/2022,5.0,One of my favorite places in Knoxville! It's super tiny but the food is so delicious. You absolutely need to order a few of the buns. I also enjoy their fried rice & dumplings. My friends and I normally get a couple things and split it. I also feel like the cost is reasonable for all that you get.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Julie H.,"Charlotte, NC",6/3/2021,5.0,"So glad we had a chance to check this place out in the beautiful Old City of Knoxville! Atmosphere is so cute and I wish we sat outside but were not prepared weather-wise haha. The food was so so so soooo good. Pictured is the mapo tofu, pork belly bun, and pork dumplings. All a hit! The mapo tofu was less saucy than I'm used to but it definitely still packed a flavorful punch. My only critique is that the rice was slightly dry :/ However, the pork belly bun was delicious. My partner got the pork belly fried rice bowl (not pictured) and he RAVED ABOUT IT all day. I ended up having some too and it was truly so delicious. The rice was crispy yet not dry. Our friend got the Dan Dan noodles and honestly this was the best, I think they needed more flavor and spice. They were still good but for Dan Dan noodles out there, there's definitely better. Overall still a great experience. Great staff and service would definitely recommend and go again! Also very fair prices!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Patrick C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4/17/2022,5.0,This place is amazing. We had a few buns and the pork belly fried rice. My wife is still talking about how delicious the food was a few weeks later. We will definitely be going back!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jalissa C.,"Collierville, TN",6/26/2021,1.0,"My friend and I came to Kaizen simply because I love trying Asian food in every city I visit . However our experience was very unpleasant , our server was beyond rude , even asking question about certain entrees her reply was very DRY , and when I told her in advance that I would like my egg OM it came out OH ( pork belly fried rice ) not to mention she put my order in wrong and I waited an extra 15 minutes for my entree which was no big deal , mistakes happen. BUT WHEN I ASKED IF I COULD GET MY EGG RECOOKED SHE HUFF AND PUFF AND YELLED OMG YES !!! I would never visit this place again , not to mention the food was very bland . Egg roll- tasted like a sausage wrapped in a deep fried pancake , I enjoyed it Pork belly fried rice - not my favorite , the rice was bland but the pork was cool Bang bang shrimp w Lo mein - the shrimp was good Lo mein needed more sauce . The host was awesome as well as the manager on duty !!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Camaryn S.,"Havelock, NC",1/4/2022,4.0,"I would say i was pretty satisfied but not blown out of the water. We had pork belly dumplings, Fried Shrimp bun, pork belly bun, hot miso-mustard chicken bun and kimchi-bbq bun, Thai chicken noodles and pork belly fried rice. The Thai chicken noodles was my favorite dish. I am in LOVE with the broth. The buns would come in 2nd as the fried shrimp and kimchi bun was my fave! The Pork belly and egg in my fried rice was delish, but the actual rice was not super tasty for me!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Chad S.,"Chicago, IL",11/12/2021,5.0,"It was a whole vibe. Delicious food, outstanding and exotic menu, well-priced, and properly portioned. My stirfry was a spicy green coconut curry sauce and my wife's lamb dish had soft udon noodles, a great broth, very tender duck, and bell peppers."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Cassidy L.,"Southside, Fort Worth, TX",6/1/2022,5.0,"Was SO impressed! The rice was extremely flavorful, the egg was cooked perfectly, and the kimchi was crunchy and spicy. Definitely recommend."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Adam C.,"Plano, TX",5/9/2022,5.0,"Great food, good spice, nice patio out back.  If the menu looks like something you're into, you'll enjoy it."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Ed H.,"New York, NY",4/17/2022,3.0,"Interesting Asian-fusion place in the old city part of Knoxville.  I'd suggest they back off the Japanese and Izakaya references however as this place doesn't have much to do with an Izakaya other then they have a bar with a strong Japanese whisky selection and some of the decor items.   We started with the pork belly buns.  The bun was ok and the pork belly seemed good too.  However the coleslaw and then spicy horseradish dressing slathered on pretty much overwhelmed the whole pork belly bun.  And definitely not how these are typically prepared.  Could have been better, a miss.I had the stir fry beef and basil noodles, a Thai dish.  Flavors didn't seem to come together.  Unremarkable.The lady had the peanut noodles.  Very forward peanut flavor.  Ok.We had a side of the dry fry eggplant and it was by far the best thing we had.   Nice taste and crunch.This place is cute and will probably do alright given the location and its relative uniqueness.  However it could be much more.  I'd suggest either going real Izakaya or backing off on it and embracing the Asian-fusion more.  Some of these dishes need work too."
kaizen-knoxville-2,John L.,"Columbus, OH",3/26/2022,5.0,Exceptional service and cocktails preceded scrumptious crispy pork belly fried rice and lamb with crystal noodles.  The staff here was so friendly we came back day after day during our visit.  Delicious. Gyoza and sticky buns ... magnifique.
kaizen-knoxville-2,T T.,"Seymour, TN",10/9/2021,4.0,"First time here. Ordered steamed buns, pork belly fried rice and the special. Everything was outstanding and overflowing with flavor! Wish they had more hand crafted cocktails and the patio could use some sprucing up, missed opportunity here. Inside was modern and clean. Service was friendly and food was fast. Will absolutely be back to try more items."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Andrew A.,"Indianapolis city (balance), IN",10/8/2021,3.0,"We've been here several times now. Decent selection of Asian fusion dishes. The steamed buns are the best thing on the menu, many options, all made fresh. They have a huge sake selection with many good options, one of the few places in town. Most of the main dishes are underwhelming. We've never had anything that's been amazing. Nothing we would crave or go back for a second time. We also went with two vegetarians, and the waitress was rude when they asked about the vegetarian options. Their food was also bland and tasteless. We keep trying to give it a chance, but at this point I think we've given up."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Martin H.,"Maryville, TN",9/2/2021,4.0,"Five of us had dinner a few nights ago. All of us enjoyed it. Service was friendly and helpful. This was our first time in the new location and it is a good looking room and much more comfortable than the previous location. We started with dumplings and egg rolls. The dumplings were a bit doughy/raw tasting but still enjoyable and the egg rolls were excellent.  We had a few different bun sandwiches and all were tasty, especially the pork belly. For our meals we had Lamb noodles, Hot and sour duck noodles, Dan Dan noodles, dry fried egg plant, coconut rice, Pork Belly fried rice and Bang Bang shrimp friend rice. Everything was very good if a little tame. Their spicy is on the mild side but the flavors are nice. I'm looking forward to our next meal there."
kaizen-knoxville-2,A S.,"San Francisco, CA",4/7/2022,2.0,"We visited in December on our Anniversary. Our seating wasn't great and our service was a kin to a cafeteria experience and a bit subpar for such a special evening. Added to all of this, the food wasn't as good as we remembered from our last visit as well. We got a $95 bill and didnt feel like we had a $95 experience at this restaurant, we may not be back for while. Bummer!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,A S.,"San Francisco, CA",1/4/2022,3.0,"We've been there a few times. The last time was on our anniversary in December. It was OK, I think our seating was not that great even though we'd made reservations.  The food seemed better the 1st time we had it. The food is very, very good you can definitely taste the time and care that they take to make it exquisite and that effort is very appreciated.  The food was good, but it wasn't $90 good. If done again I would probably go somewhere else for that price. But it's still very good!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Claire S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2022,5.0,This place is amazing. Make sure you follow their insta for their daily specials. Those are typically my favorite meals! Their patio is such a cool spot as well!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jared M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/26/2021,5.0,This place is phenomenal! Loved the pork belly friend rice. The fried egg is a really nice touch and pork is very tender. Very limited seating inside the restaurant. There is a back patio but it was too told to use in winter. They do offer take out curbside.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Natalie M.,"Henrietta, NY",4/9/2021,4.0,"Great lunch spot! During lunch time all the rice bowls are half off. My favorite dish to get is the pork belly fried rice bowls. It's got such a variety of flavors. The pork belly is savory, the rice has a sour notes, and the egg provides a nice creaminess. They recently relocated and the new location has a great outdoor seating area. It is the perfect date or hang out place. And also bonus, the food looks so picture esk. The boa buns are also fire! I would recommend the pork belly or the Nashville got a chicken. I also recommend asking the waited what dumplings they have today because each day they have a new dumpling."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jenn W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2021,4.0,"My husband and I ate here recently on a weeknight.  We've heard a lot about Kaizen over the past year or so, and finally made a point of trying it out.  We started with a couple of appetizers, the Nashville Man Bun and dumplings.  I loved the Nashville Man Bun, and the dumplings were pretty good as well.For our entrees, I chose the Orange Tamarind Chicken Lo Mein.  I enjoyed it, but it was heavily drenched in the orange glaze.  My husband had the Golden Curry Shrimp and Pork Noodles, which he really liked.We were glad to finally check out Kaizen.  They have a good bit of outdoor seating, so that's a nice option.  Service was also excellent!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Adrian C.,"Nashville, TN",7/17/2021,1.0,"If you want an authentic Asian food, don't go here. The worst ever!!!We ordered pork belly bun, I couldn't believe the bun is coldAlso the Dan Dan Noodle, the wrong noodles, wrong taste and no sauce at all. I think the chef downloaded wrong recipe fro google The dry fried eggplants looked so good yet no taste.Very disappointed"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Mary Lou C.,"Maryville, TN",6/4/2022,3.0,We ate here last night . Were disappointed with the meal . The gyoza was bland .. basically fried pork with green onione on top . Maybe put the onion in the pork. The pork belly bowl was dry and not as good as It has been before . Nice outdoor seating in back and good service though.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Dylan S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/4/2020,4.0,"If I could give 4.5 stars to Kaizen I would.... This is one of my main go to Asian spots in Knoxville.  Usually it's a 5 star experience from service to food.  Every once in a while the food seems a little inconsistent as far as flavors of some of their mainstay dishes. The dumplings and bao buns are ALWAYS amazing, can't go wrong there.  9 times out of 10 their specials and rotating menu options are also amazing with the exception of the ramen. Their ramen dishes always leave me a little disappointed. The broth usually lacks in depth/ flavor, and the noodles make me sad (taste like college cuisine)."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Ravi S.,"Tucson, AZ",1/18/2020,4.0,"So I was in Knoxville for a couple days to take an Exxon and of course I had to celebrate by eating at a dope restaurant. After much research I settled on Kaizen. They do take reservations so plus, but I went with my parents and I kind of blanked so we had to wait about an hour for bar seating so not the end of the world, but less than ideal. The restaurant itself is cute, but a bit small. Which is a pro and con? I love small restaurants because I think generally it's a better atmosphere, more intimate, and I think they can put more thought into things, but don't prefer the small areas sometimes. Anyway, onto the main event: the food. Appetizers:Started out with some bao buns, eggplant and the Thai sausage which were both good. My parents never had bao buns before and they enjoyed them too. Dinner:I couldn't decide between the curry and the buffalo shrimp fried rice so I had the waiter surprise me and he got me the fried rice which I was pretty thankful for because I am extremely guilty of always getting a ramen at every restaurant I go to The fried rice was served similarly to a korean rice bowl in my opinion. Rice on the bottom, toppings, meat, and fried egg over. It was delicious. It wasn't all that spicy or anything, but the flavor of the ""buffalo sauce"" mixed with everything was different than what i anticipated. My dad got the fish and he really loved the way the halibut was prepared. My mom got the peanut noodles and she also enjoyed it. They can both be hard to please at times so that's a good sign for the place. Dessert:Got the creme Brûlée and the lychee ice cream. The creme brûlée was coffee flavored was interesting, but I thought well made. Lychee is one of my favorite fruit so when they said they had an ice cream i ordered one right away. I didn't love it and I didn't not like it. Tbh I didn't really understand how I felt about it. I think I just prefer the fruit over the ice cream version. Overall:Highly recommend this place, but I would make a reservation first!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Mary T.,"Knoxville, TN",11/27/2019,5.0,"This place is one of my favorite Asian restaurants in Knoxville.  It's located on Clinch Ave in downtown Knox on a one-way street.  It's small, cute, and has a fun atmosphere. They have a patio and a full bar (large selection of Asian bevs). Follow them on Facebook or Instagram to see their daily specials.  The stay open later than a lot of places on the weekends. I absolutely love their steamed buns!! The Nashville man bun, the chicken katsu bun, the fried eggplant bun, the pork belly bun & the Thai sausage bun are my favs!! Other dishes I really enjoy are Pork Belly Fried Rice, Dry Fry Eggplant, dumplings (they change daily), Dan Dan Noodles, and the Hot & Sour Duck Noodles.  The specials they run are usually delicious.  So, if you are downtown and craving Asian food, go check this place out.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed as it's one of my favorites in town and I crave it on the regular!! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!  Cheers & Enjoy!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kelly F.,"TN, TN",5/21/2021,3.0,"We tried the new location and sorry to say, left disappointed. Location and outside courtyard are fine; service was good and I still love their drinks collection....but we realized we could have had better food by going to just about any decent Chinese restaurant.Buns-- didn't seem steamed as much as just taking the bun annd using it as a taco- filling holder. And the fillings we had were tasty, but the buns were just   too doughy and not with the steamed quality that softens them (and also often imparts the flavor/juices of the filling onto the bun).We had one noodle dish and the sauce was just too thick, coating the noodles too much. I know this sounds picky but the noodles weren't nearly as tasty as noodles can be when LIGHTLY touched/coated by a tasty sauce or broth.Not a bad meal but really, we could have had about the same at any Chinese restaurant for a lot lower cost or with a lot more variety of dishes."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kelly F.,"TN, TN",7/2/2018,4.0,"So, others have made a point which I'll repeat-- this is not really Japanese food, although the spirit of ""kaizen"" can sure be seen, in taking Asian mainstays (but mostly from other Asian cuisines) and improving on them, or giving them a new twist. We've been twice and enjoyed both times-- the buns are great, the variety of tastes overall when sharing several small plates is wonderful, the drink menu is varied and well-priced. Service was ok; not great but no problem. You can have a very tasty meal with lots of different items at a decent price.We did find that the mapo-dofu (sp?) was quite different from any version we ever had in Asia. Again, an American fusion take on the common Chinese dish, and not bad at all, but not close enough to the original to really merit bearing the name.Still, a great addition to Knoxville. Just don't go expecting to eat real/authentic Japanese food. I think EAST in Farragut is still about the only place for that."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Josh B.,"Knoxville, TN",10/3/2021,5.0,"Probably my favorite Knoxville restaurant. Unbelievably good sticky buns. Would recommend trying them all. Also, they typically have a special that changes daily. That is usually my choice over the regularly menu because they always knock it out of the park with the specials. That said, the regularly menu is great too. The dumplings change on almost a daily basis. A must get. The octopus ball is a must have. The fried rices are perfect for someone is isn't quite as adventurous. The new Old City location is great too. A lot more space. Their prices have increased a little recently, but so has just about everyone. Still would highly recommend."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jessica L.,"Knoxville, TN",10/20/2021,5.0,"Easily one of the best restaurants we now regularly go to in Knoxville. Not only is the food excellent every time (we love to try the special each time we go) BUT the servers are always incredibly friendly, kind, attentive. The food comes out fast and they are always accomodating and helpful when we need to make a food substitution for a medical reason (most restaurants give us a hard time or charge extra). We always sit outside on their cool patio, you can't beat the vibe under the lights at night."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Laura S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/7/2020,5.0,"Had the Pork Belly Fried Rice and Dumpling of the Day (Pork + Watercress). I've been wanting to try Kaizen for a few years now, and was so excited to finally get to go last night!The atmosphere is great. Their outdoor patio was perfect and made me feel more at ease during pandemic times. The dumplings were a great starter and the pork belly fried rice was SO delicious! It was like comfort food. But, disclaimer: be prepared to eat with chopsticks here PS - For more photos like these and reviews, follow @lauraplatesfood on Instagram!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kathleen P.,"Knoxville, TN",9/21/2021,2.0,"Nothing is traditional, which is fine, I like inventions. The bang bang shrimp bun was great. The hot and sour udon was alright, flavors were pretty good and it was heavy with meats and the bonito fish flakes. I think it could've used something fresh on top besides the scallions, or maybe tempura flakes to add texture. The orange chicken lo mein was difficult to eat. Not the orange chicken of American Chinese places, and not lo mein flavored with anything like soy sauce or garlic or onion, this entire dish was completely overwhelmed by a single flavor: ground up orange rind. It would have been better to put the orange just on the chicken or balance it out with garlic, and stir fry the lo mein with its own sauces. Overall, entrees were edible but not great. Bun was good. Servers didn't seem excited about the food, asking about the menu they each said what they have is written down on the menu instead of describing the dishes. Didn't get offered dessert and didn't get offered the special until I asked about it, the servers are too casual for my taste or not educated about the menu and more just exist to run your order to the kitchen. The backyard patio is cute at first glance, string lights are busted, no plants on the planter hooks, dying trees, mosquitos and gnats at night, mediocre ambiance."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Stephanie D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2/25/2022,5.0,"Hot miso-mustard chicken steam buns, Dan-dan noodles, and takoyaki are top notch. Will go again and order 1 million of those steam buns."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Emily C.,"Ridott, IL",11/6/2021,5.0,AMAZING FOOD!!! Great service! The Bang Bang fried rice with shrimp will get me back every time!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Ian D.,"Charlotte, NC",7/25/2021,5.0,"Our first time in Knoxville and this was the first place we decided to go to for a meal. The location is great (in the Old City), they have a nice outdoor area around the back, and the aesthetic inside is excellent too. And the food was incredible. We will definitely be back the next time we visit!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Zachary A.,"Tallahassee, FL",4/17/2021,5.0,Great kimchi and noodles! Cozy spot in the old city offering a variety of Asian dishes. Would definitely recommend
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lisa L.,"Westerville, OH",4/24/2022,5.0,Fantastic place! Don't be fooled by the modest door front. They have a lovely back patio that is a must visit in the good weather. The food was amazing! I tried the eggplant dumpling and wished I had more. I had the mushroom fried rice-- huge portion and crispy rice well seasoned with lots of mushrooms. We also got the beef and curry with glass noodles. Add a side of kimchi and you'll be very happy. Highly recommend!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kelly L.,"Knoxville, TN",7/19/2019,3.0,"My friend had been recommended this place by multiple people and I had just come back knoxville, so we came to try this place out. Overall I would say the vibe is interesting and they definitely have a large selection of Japanese beer, sake, and whiskey. Food was average though for the price. We got the the oyster fried rice, which at $15 is a bit steep for the quantity and the amount of meat. We got two katsu buns (2 for $5) which were pretty good, but the chicken didn't quite taste like chicken. I also got an order of the dumplings as the special of the day was chicken/duck dumplings ($4). I couldn't taste the duck at all and one order is four very small dumplings that were a bit undercooked as the wrappers were a bit hard. I tried and I guess I'll mark it off my list."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Meghan W.,"Saint Paul, MN",4/8/2021,2.0,"We got delivery from Kaizen tonight. We were so looking forward to this meal. The pork steamed buns were good, however, we ordered 3 tofu dishes and all were void of any taste or texture. The tofu steamed bun had no flavor. But The stir fry beef and basil with tofu instead of beef was where the real trouble began.1) we were charged $22 for the tofu version- this was a major overcharge without the beef2) the tofu version had no sauce, no basil, no flavor- it was weird- considering we also ordered the beef version, there was a major difference between the two.I wonder if Kaizen is really able to make high quality tofu options? That is my concern. Bummed at my overcharged and under seasoned dinner"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Garry C.,"Farmington Hills, MI",4/2/2022,1.0,Worst noodle I had. Good app but the noodle was so salty. I don't know if it's a southern thing but couldn't understand how anyone could give it 4 and half star
kaizen-knoxville-2,Buck S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",8/4/2021,5.0,"Great location, indoor/outdoor seating, decor is nice. Food was delicious, piping hot, decent sized portion. You can tell a lot of technique was put into making and perfecting the food here. Flavors mesh well, colors are there, food is very pretty to look at. I'd highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Shane S.,"Knoxville, TN",8/15/2021,5.0,"Time and again my favorite place in Knoxville. I can be a picky eater, but it seems like every dumpling they have on special is perfect for me. Their main dishes are wonderful whether cold to hot. And the fried eggplant is ridiculous. Just make sure you're eating eggplant and not a pepper that looks suspiciously eggplant like (it can happen easier than you think)."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Madison M.,"Atlanta, GA",2/5/2022,2.0,"Food is amazing, but service is horrible :( We love the food at Kaizen & usually just get it to go but we wanted to eat in the restaurant for a change. It was very busy & we would not have minded waiting, but there is literally nowhere in the restaurant to wait & it was freezing outside. The staff was so rude to us when we tried to sit at the bar & after being told the bar was open seating. Also, we waited a while to talk to someone after there were 3 servers/ bartenders standing there staring at us doing nothing else at the time. I have never felt so stressed out & unwelcome trying to go eat at a restaurant before. I guess we will just have to plan on placing our order for pickup from now on!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Alexandra A.,"Riverview, FL",10/30/2020,5.0,"Excellent service, delicious food and margarita was on point! We will be back for more!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Nell S.,"Knoxville, TN",8/9/2021,5.0,"With everyone griping very chance they get about how customer service has tanked during the pandemic I honestly have to say I just have not seen it. Possibly because I stick to places like Kaizen. They have remained good, fast, pleasant, and nimble throughout this entire pandemic. They quickly adjusted their business to work with regulations and limitations, maintaining an efficient to go business when they could not have the dining room open. They even managed to open in a new, wonderful location with ample outdoor dining, without missing a beat. The food is consistently good, inventive, and comes out fast. Service is top notch. Hats off to Kaizen for doing it right - you are a gem!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Nell S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/20/2018,5.0,My favorite place to eat lately -- great for vegetarians. The buns never disappoint! The fried rice is fantastic. The specials are always inventive and tasty. Kaizen like grown up food in a city full of kids menu menu cuisine!!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kathryn H.,"Greenville, SC",3/21/2019,5.0,"My friend and I stopped here on a long road trip for lunch. We came in around 5pm right when it opened on a Friday afternoon and was immediately seated since there were only 2 other tables seated. The space is reallllly small, but the bar is pretty impressive given the space. It's a little grunge-looking restaurant and definitely errs on the side of hipster-esque, so it's not somewhere you'd go with someone on a fancy date or anything.The waiter was pretty patient given that we were so indecisive, however, we ended up ordering the Dan Dan Noodles, Takoyaki, and 2 buns. Now the buns and takoyaki were pretty good but the real star of the show was the Dan Dan noodles. I keep thinking about these noodles cause they were soooo freaking good!  The noodles are served cold in a spicy oil sauce with schezuan peppercorn. It also has super seasoned and super flavorful ground pork on top, garnished with a mix slaw of cabbage and other greens. Man, these noodles were some of the best I've had. The cold noodles contrasted with the spicy sauce and then you get the crunch from the cabbage slaw and the flavor from the pork just punches your tongue. My taste buds were dancing.  5 stars, would make the drive up here just for the noodles. By the time we left and got dessert and circled back, the whole place was packed. Guess we got lucky and came at the right time or else we would be waiting forever! Also, we split everything up and it was the perfect amount of food for around $20 bucks plus tip."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Laura B.,"Oak Ridge, TN",12/6/2021,3.0,"I'm giving a 3 star rating due to our first visit at Kaizen. We were not super impressed with our first order, and did not return for awhile. The fried rice was okay; however, the pork belly was undercooked, and the steamed buns were especially bland. Recently, we gave Kaizen another try and were happy with our order. We ordered the pork belly fried rice and asked for the pork to be cooked well done. The fried rice was flavorful and the pork belly was much better."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lettie F.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2021,5.0,"A gem in the Old City. Great good, service, atmosphere, and now a lovely patio! Mapo doufu, dry-fried eggplant, tamari potatoes, lots of sake...the list of deliciosity goes on."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Bluestone B.,"Framingham, MA",9/24/2021,5.0,"Amazing place. Good vibes. We had sake,  Bang bang shrimp fried rice and eggplant bun."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Amy L.,"Knoxville, TN",6/18/2021,5.0,Landed here for dinner unexpectedly in June 2021.  What a happy day!  My friend and I shared both the bang bang shrimp & fried rice as well as the beef lo mein.  Differing flavor and texture combinations in each - both spot on for the dish.  Will absolutely visit this spot again!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Trinity E.,"Knoxville, TN",11/16/2020,5.0,"I loved loved this place! They have an amazing patio, and i didn't mind the wait! I felt they were taking very good covid precautions. The server even knew the menu well enough to make sure i really enjoyed my food. I look forward to visiting again. Great addition to the old city."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Andrea C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/20/2020,5.0,"I miss the old Japanese dark alley feel of the last location. There is ambiance that can be improved with the new location. But the food and service is excellent as always. Love the jalapeño cocktail, steamed buns, and Dan Dan noodles. Hope this place continues to thrive in Knoxville because it continues to be a favorite."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Andrea C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/15/2018,4.0,"Kaizen is one of my favorites downtown. I love the atmosphere and the staff is friendly. It's quaint so I recommend making a reservation. There is also a small bar for first come first serve seating. The Katsu and Eggplant steamed buns are awesome. Wasn't a huge fan of the Nashville man bun steamed bun but it's a matter of personal preference (flavors not as interesting as the others). I also love the lumpia. Presentation is beautiful. I prefer to go for appetizers and drinks as they outshine the noodle dishes I have tried (though still very good), but I hope to try the fried rice soon."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Joshua L.,"Powell, TN",5/29/2021,5.0,"The food was out of this world good. You can tell everything is made in house with the most attention to detail possible. We had the Katsu and Nashville hot buns and they were to die for. I could eat a dozen of the katsu with ease. Layers of flavor in ever bite. A little sweetness, spicy, umami, salty, just outstanding. The dumplings were fantastic with their house-made dumpling sauce. Finally, the pork belly fried rice is my new favorite Asian dish in Knox. They layered the flavor so perfectly as opposed to just mixing everything together half-hazardously. The kimchi was outstanding, pork belly cooked to perfection, perfectly cooked rice with an outstanding flavor in its own right, the egg to bring the richness and creamy texture from the yoke. The cilantro and green onions for the freshness. I added a little chili oil to add spice to the mix. Like I said, absolutely to die for. This is now a staple in our rotation and we will be back time and time again."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Faith B.,"Milwaukee, WI",12/17/2019,4.0,"This has been on my ""to-try"" list since i moved to Knoxville, but somehow I never made it until last week. I finally wandered over for lunch with a group, going early to ensure we could snag seats for 6.We were seated immediately and the bartender delivered menus. We had lots of questions, since just one of us had eaten there before.I had the crispy eggplant bun, a cold Asahi, and the mushroom fried rice. I didn't expect much from the rice, even though I love mushrooms, but it as fantastic! There were layers of nuanced flavor - mushrooms, spice, a fried egg, fresh cilantro, etc.It wasn't the least bit bland, but it was still comforting on a cold, wet day. The bun was a tasty little treat as well.My friends mainly had the peanut noodles with various protein options and enjoyed them very much.One colleague had a fish dumpling of the day and pronounced it amazing. They looked great, but were on the petite side.My other friend had a duck soup and it smelled amazing. She said it's on her regular rotation. The atmosphere is warm and charming, although I hear they are moving to Old City soon.I'll be back soon to try more."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lauren C.,"Knoxville, TN",3/29/2021,3.0,"Every time I go to Kaizen, I am hopeful. Whenever I get my food, whether dine-in or take-out, I find I am disappointed. The steamed buns are delicious. Every single one of them- but eggplant is the best. Some issues I have with Kaizen, all tofu is barley cooked or flavored. It seems as if the chef doesn't understand how to make tofu taste like food. The shrimp at kaizen tastes very fishy and not fresh at all, thought it is clean and we have never had a shell issue. Finally, all the specials look good but seem to be inundated with bell peppers. Sometimes these peppers are not listed on the menu and you get home with a take-out container full of peppers and not able to eat your dinner. I love how hard this place is trying, and I love how local they are. But, I am having a very hard time finding a go-to dish, or even a dish that isn't underwhelming."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Nora G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/9/2020,5.0,"Just tried this place for the first time and WOW!!! My friend and I each got the pork belly fried rice, a pork belly bun, a katsu bun, and the takoyaki!!!AH-MAZING!!!  Literally one of the best Asian meals I've had in Knoxville period!! The pork belly melted in my mouth and the buns were soft and moist!! I absolutely recommend trying this place!! Will be going there again for sure"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kevin F.,"Tallahassee, FL",8/10/2019,4.0,"Good experience and good food. On a biz trip and I typically have a colleague to eat with, but this night, I did not. I was greeted at the door and offered a seat outside or at the bar. Being too hot for comfort outside, I chose the bar. It wasn't very crowded inside and I was met by a bartender fairly quickly. She was prompt with her checking on me, but not very engaging otherwise. I ordered a beer and then Takiyaki and Dan Dan Noodles. Both were good, but not mind-blowing. I'd come back to try more of the menu. Try to come with someone so you're not sectioned off to the bar."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lyle R.,"Hailey, ID",8/9/2019,2.0,"I had higher hopes for Kaizen based on the reviews.  The egg rolls were pencil thin, which resulted in more of a taquito. So the taste was mainlyJust the flour based skin.  The Dumpling we had wasn't bad, but nothing about it really stood out. We had the Yakisoba. Besides the spiciness there really wasn't much to it, besides a lot of noodles.  Not a lot of chicken and minimal vegetables, and now that I think about it the price for that dish was kind of high at $14. You can tell the quality of ingredients was good and they are trying to make good food they just need to do a better job of putting it together."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Nash B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/15/2021,5.0,Best place for steamed buns in Knoxville! Amazing vegetarian options also. Great place to hang out and grab a bite!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Caitlin C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/26/2019,5.0,"My favorite restaurant in Knoxville. I recommend it to everyone. It is VERY small and although they don't take reservations online, you can call and make one. Highly recommend this since space is so limited. They always have specials that are incredible but I can never pass up their steamed buns. I know eggplant doesn't sound like an obvious choice, but it has an amazing sauce. I could eat 5 of them. Pictured is the oyster fried rice (huge portion) and a ramen special. My friend and I got a special chocolate dessert one day and it was delicious as well although I am not sure if they have a regular dessert menu. I can't say anything particularly positive about the ambience or customer service (but not negative either!) but that's how great the food is. Still my favorite restaurant. They are closed sundays and mondays which always leaves me with that ""craving-chickfilA-on-a-Sunday"" feeling."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Anna M.,"Maryville, TN",5/6/2021,5.0,"This is our favorite restaurant in knoxville! Our go to date night place. Specials are always inventive, and the regular menu options like Dan Dan noodles and the fried rice (definitely not your typical fried rice) are amazing too."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Rachel W.,"Little Rock, AR",7/6/2019,5.0,A wonderful foodie experience. I'm having to follow a gluten free diet which is crushing for a foodie such as myself. This place was a delight! We sat outside on the patio to enjoy a summer meal of Asian fare and cold sake. The Dry Fry Eggplant really inspired awe. The chili is subtle but before you realize it - as you've been digging into the delicious crispy eggplant spears covered with scallions and cilantro - you realize your lips and tongue are tingling.... and you like it!I had the Pork Belly Fried rice with Kimchee and my tastebuds sang. I was so happy to bring home leftovers. They won't last long. My husband ordered several different buns and ate in silent wonder. I wish I could have had a bite!Our service was excellent. Quickly served and by a knowledgeable staff who were obviously proud of their craft and their food. Prices we found were delightfully reasonable for the excellent quality. We can't wait to go back.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lareesa T.,"Knoxville, TN",5/29/2021,5.0,"the shrimp fried rice, steamed buns, and egg rolls were great! Service was great, and the patio is nice in the summer weather"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",4/16/2017,3.0,"Umm. Here we go again? Again I'm here to check out the favorites of Knoxville and I finally got to try it out. And to be honest, it's just okay. I know there are better Asian places around Knoxville for a cheaper price... I get it, I get it. The location is downtown and yeah, the price of rent is higher. Still... Pad Thai for $17? Fried rice for $14? I mean damn, if only great Chinese/Asian restaurants could charge these prices. If they did charge these prices it wouldn't be the amount for one person, rather a whole family. Okay. Done with my rant, onto the review. Walking in it's a cute place right around the corner of market square and a block down from Falafel. The walls hang all these artworks, one caught the attention of the GF. She was reminded of it and how she used to make them when she was a child and now it's hanging on the wall for $100. They have a full bar, but limited seating. So the menu. First off, it's not a ""bun"" it's a ""bao"". I think it sort of irks me because I have Taiwan heritage in my blood. I don't care if you change it and try something else and mix it, but don't change the name It's a Bao. It's not a Bun. I really hate it when food is rebranded and it doesn't respect where it originated from. However, being said the baos were good. We ordered the Katsu and the Pork Belly. We also ordered the dumplings from the menu. It was alright. I mean it was not anything special, the sauce was a little bit weird to go with the dumplings. For the entree I ordered the only thing on the menu that was eye catching. This was the Dan Dan noodles. This originates from Sichuan, and it wasn't bad. It had good flavor, but wasn't as spicy as the usual when I have it and that's good. The GF ordered the pork belly hot and sour noodles. She enjoyed it, and the name fit the dish pretty well. If you've ever had hot and sour soup, add some pork belly and noodles and there you have it. The prices are up to the restaurant. If they can make money and serve whatever they serve then more power to them. But for me, and my jaded tastes in Asian food, this place is just okay at best."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Pim K.,"Raleigh, NC",5/5/2019,5.0,"We loved it so much we picked this place for our last dinner in Knoxville, TN! We're both a fan of Asian food/flavors and this place is definitely worth the price if you're looking to satisfy your tastebuds. It's not easy to craft a good balance between two very different cuisines (French and Japanese) but Kaizen did a great job. They also switch up the menu once in a while, which I love.The place is rather small but if you don't mind sitting at the bar or having a drink while waiting for a table to open up, you won't be disappointed.Would I go back?Yes, next time we visit Knoxville, we are definitely going here!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Sandra D.,"Katy, TX",2/19/2021,5.0,"Great Asian flair!!!  Followed reviews and got the 2/$5 Buns, the fried rice and dumplings. All were very good. What I enjoyed the most was the Asian beer selection!!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jonathan G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/8/2020,4.0,"Wow! Such a great place! I see why it's rated so highly. The bao buns were spectacular! And the fried rice, delicious! The only thing I'd say is that they barely put any meat in their dishes which is a bummer. But they do know how to season a good pork belly."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Erika M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/12/2017,5.0,"Yep.  I pretty much love this place.  I could eat here breakfast, lunch, and dinner if my wallet and pants would allow for it.  This small space has been transitioned into something intimate and inviting.  Which seems to have been a challenge for the last couple of occupants.  I have had great service each time I have eaten here.  The servers know the menu well, including the specials.  And they are quick to make any sort of adjustments and substitutions painless.  The food is freaking fantastic.  Like OMG fantastic.  The menu is a constantly changing and evolving to be the best that it can be.   I appreciate that.  It keeps it fresh and never gets stale.  The Asian fusion food is delicious is and pulls its influence heavily from Japanese cuisine, but there are definitely notes of Korean and Thai mixed in.  The steam buns are heaven, each and every one.  I can't pick a favorite.  The shareable vegetable side dishes are so flavorful and always a table favorite.  You can't go wrong with a single thing on the menu, but the nightly specials always knock my socks off. I love that the priced points are scattered.  You can eat well here for under $10 (Steam bun and a half order of fried rice, that is pretty big), or you can step into a higher price point and have something a little more extravagant.  Either way, you will go home with a happy belly that doesn't cramp your budget's style."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Vanessa C.,"Chico, CA",2/23/2021,5.0,When I moved from Las Vegas to Knoxville I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find an authentic and legit delicious Asian restaurant but then I found Kaizen and I was so happy. Every time I eat there I get the dumpling special and a new item on the menu and I haven't had one thing I didn't like. It is all delicious. And the staff is really great too. This restaurant meets the caliber of the best of Vegas and I love eating there.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Alex F.,"Leesburg, VA",11/20/2019,5.0,"Best restaurant of the year for me.  Every time I travel for work, I check in Yelp for Chinese or Asian restaurants.  It's the best combination of tasty and healthy.  Usually, I am led to a place with 3 or 4 stars and it turns out to be a buffet or a hole in the wall kitchen that dishes out chinese food in molded styrofoam trays.  Often turns out okay but does not send me home with a raving review like I have for Kaizen.  This a truly eclectic and fine place.  The descriptor of fusion really fits.  The store front looks like a street side sandwich cafe.  The interior looks like a cozy bar.  The music is retro seventies and eighties.  Bad Company music (yes!) with Asian food; it doesn't get more eclectic than that!  The first time I came, I had the shrimp fried rice.  But that name does not do it justice!  It had shrimp, Kim chi, a fried egg and much, much more!  Reminded me more of Bim and Bap than fried rice.  It was delicious and generously portioned.  I also sampled the duck dumplings (who could pass that up?!), these were small finger bites and quite good.  Tempting fate and my great experience the first day, I came back for lunch on the second day.  When I asked the waiter for a suggestion for something different than fried rice, he recommended a duck udon noodle soup, and ""warned"" me that it was spicy. --Dude, you said the magic word!  In Tennessee, I was tempted to ask him to bring me hot sauce on the side (glad I didn't).  When it arrived, it smelled fantastic and I was shocked when I looked down and saw IT WAS MOVING!  There were these little small ribbon things that were waving in the air like ribbons on a fan.  Seriously.  I asked about it and he said it was some kind of fish preparation.  Way cool!  When I tasted it I entered into a form of duck and noodle nirvana.  Spicy, yes, but not indulgently so.  And filled with a complex mix of flavors that left me compelled to sit down and write this review.  Cool and fun spot if you like Asian food, duck, and good restaurant vibes."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Ashley K.,"Jeffersonville, IN",3/20/2021,5.0,"Place was amazing! Beer selection great. Server recommendations, knowledge of menu,  and service was outstanding. I sat by the host stand and they acknowledged every person coming in! Food flavor on point! I have all good things to say about this place. Smaller menu, those are the best places."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Stephen S.,"Knoxville, TN",9/21/2018,3.0,"So, I'm going to be unfairly critical of Kaizen... I'm sorry in advance...  though they're going in the right direction in Knoxville,  they can be so much better.  We had the Crows Nest noodles and the Market Noodles.   Also had two steamed buns.The steamed buns were very good, both the chicken and the Thai sausage.   We felt the soy reduction sauce for the Crows Nest really weighed down the dish, its a bit overly soy-saucy for us.  The Market Noodles were ok. I liked the tangy aftertaste,  but generally its not a must have dish.  I'll try Kaizen once again because I love oysters and they have several oyster dishes.   The staff was excellent,  going beyond the call to assist us with some special requests.   We very much appreciated that.I could envision having a dinner if steamed buns here, but thus far I don't love the entrees.  My next visit I will tell them what I didn't like, and ask for a recommendation that is different.   I want to give them another shot."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/21/2016,3.0,"Came here for lunch and the service was pretty fast. My water was bottomless so that's a plus. Don't be afraid to ask to customize your dish - they are good with accommodating. Okonomiyaki: Japanese pancake. Not as great as Korean pancakes. It seems like it tried to be a Korean pancake but failed. Great for first timers. Don Don noodle: Tasted better a few hours later. Maybe I was too full? I wasn't impressed with this at all. It was just noodles with black bean sauce. I could've made this and added in protein. It has a hint of spice. Curry veggie with tofu: the curry was very watery. I ordered this because I wanted protein and they didn't have veggie dumplings. Eggplant bun: must order! The bun was so warm and soft and chewy and oh the eggplant..the eggplant was so flavorful! You must order this!!!Fried eggplant: Not comparable to the eggplant bun. I was hoping the taste would be similar but it wasn't. I appreciated the crispy edges on some of the eggplants but there wasn't much flavor to this. My friend had ramen and loved it. It sure did smell good! Overall, I'm not sure why my yelper amiga loves this restaurant. I ordered a large amount to judge this joint and I won't be coming back. Maybe it's better for meat eaters?"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Joanna V.,"Columbus, OH",7/21/2021,5.0,"This place is amazing! We loved everything we got including the bang bang shrimp bun, the katsu bun, Dan dan noodles, pork belly fried rice, and the shrimp curry. The staff were also friendly and the patio is lovely."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Alexis B.,"Baltimore, MD",11/18/2016,4.0,"We stopped in Knoxville for a few hours as we were driving back to Nashville from the Smokies. Around 1 pm on a weekday, the Market Square restaurants were packed, but I had found Kaizen on Yelp when I was researching where to eat in Knoxville, and I'm very glad I did! We walked a block over to Clinch, and the lunch rush of Market Square disappeared! Kaizen was not busy at all - which was surprising, given the quality of the food and the service! Kaizen is Asian fusion. Everything on the menu, from steamed buns to fried rice to noodles, looked amazing, and I had a hard time deciding what to eat! Luckily, our wonderful actress recommended one of the daily specials, and that saved me from re-reading the menu for another twenty minutes! The special was a very spicy noodle dish with Gulf shrimp, and it was good! Spicy, delicious, super simple. I enjoyed it. My fiance got the pork fried rice, which he loved. They had great beers on tap as well. And the service was really good! They also have a few tables on a front patio, where we enjoyed our meal (the weather was gorgeous and it was so quiet outside)!All in all, Kaizen was a great lunch spot. Good food, reasonable prices, charming cafe, good service!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kara G.,"Anderson, SC",8/1/2021,5.0,I honestly love this place. I just don't think it's possible for them to make something that isn't absolutely delicious--I have had several of the dishes here and enjoyed them very much every time. Highly recommend.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Callie G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/29/2018,5.0,"Kaizen is currently my favorite restaurant in K-Town! Everything on the menu is so inspired, and you can tell that the recipes are crafted with such pride and care. The cuisine is a fusion of both Japanese and French, and the taste is indescribable. The restaurant is small and does not take reservations, so there can be up to a 2-hour wait during peak hours. I have waited for two hours, however. Yes - the food is that worth the wait!My recommendations: any of the steamed buns (but the oyster or pork belly buns for sure), the takoyaki, and the ""jelly"" sake."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Greg K.,"Mobile, AL",3/1/2020,4.0,"Very impressed with Kaizen. The food is excellent the steamed buns slap! Especially the Nashville bun. The golden curry is bomb shrimp is killer too. Only thing holding me back from five stars is the seating. Very small restaurant, but worth the wait. Make a reservation before hand and you'll be golden."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Charles D.,"Chattanooga, TN",6/22/2018,4.0,"OooOOOoooh!Bon and I liked this place a lot!After checking out some of the reviews for Kaizen, I decided we had to eat here. Then I looked at the photos other reviewers had taken of the entrees and I knew we had to try the Pork Belly fried rice.Oh, it was very, very good. We also ordered some of the bun appetizers and found them to be equally wonderful. I got the Nashville Man Bun and Bon got the Oyster Bun.Our waiter was on top of things and his salesmanship was impeccable. At his suggestion, we ordered the Creme Brule for dessert and it was delightful.As good as the items we ordered were, we really look forward to coming back and trying All The Things."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Myriah L.,"Alpharetta, GA",4/3/2021,4.0,The food is wonderful and the patio is so relaxing. They did use an extreme amount of herbs though on EVERYTHING
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jessie E.,"Knoxville, TN",10/15/2020,3.0,Great fried shrimp & Nashville man bun. Excellent old fashioned drinks. Friendly service.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Donna S.,"Austin, TX",10/26/2018,5.0,"Wanted to try a new place for dinner. Only in town a few nights so wanted something GOOD.The reviews drew me in. SO GLAD! Small cozy space. Friendly, helpful staff. We had Hot & Sour Duck Noodles, Chicken & Mushroom Yakisoba & Oyster Fried Rice. Everyone raved about all the dishes. Yakisoba was very generous serving (enough for 2...so had for lunch next day).Will DEFINITELY come back when in town & have already told lots of local friends about it."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Mallory L.,"Las Vegas, NV",11/16/2019,4.0,"We've enjoyed everything we've had here so far. Love their pork belly fried rice. The pork belly texture definitely needs improvement (very tough/chewy), but otherwise it's fantastic. All the buns we've had have been great. Customer service was just okay. Definitely recommend checking them out."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Allen T.,"Knoxville, TN",9/14/2021,2.0,"Not a fan, first warning sign was the decor and name suggesting a Japanese restaurant but basically their entire menu is Chinese or Chinese fusion. Other than the takoyaki  and sake you'll struggle to find a Japanese dish on the entire menu. Takoyaki were good with bonito, scallions, and a Japanese style Mayo, But somehow their bonito flakes were bland. It's cured, dried fish but somehow they had very little flavor. You'd think that would be impossible. Bland is the theme here. Next Dan Dan noodles that came with no sauce on it and only a tiny to go cup of what they call ""chili oil"" which did not have even a slight hint of spicy to it. And for the giant portion of noodles I was only give maybe 2 tablespoons, this couldn't be less authentic. It's a Sichuan dish, it should be spicy and oily and further I doubt there was even a bit of Szechuan pepper in the whole dish. Seriously  they need to google Dan Dan noodles. I'm not sure they have any idea how they are supposed to taste or they just decided white people wouldn't eat real Chinese or something. So I got cold sauceless noodles instead, they were fine and quite bland.  Finally their steam buns are lazy knock offs, instead of actually making the whole filled dumpling they just serve it taco style with ingredients stuffed in at the last second unlike real Bao where they get to cook together and let the flavors mix. Forgettable knock off asian food with all the flavor taken out. Skip it. Unless you just want to try takoyaki because I don't think anyone else in East Tennessee even sells them."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Sara K.,"Charlotte, NC",7/22/2018,5.0,"I personally love everything about this place. The atmosphere, staff and food are top notch. Menu isn't huge, picky eaters may struggle, but if you want a taste explosion this is your place. Daily specials make it very reasonable and the sparkling sake on draft is delicious and a nice little beer selection. Definitely seek this place out!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Eun-Jin C.,"Farragut, TN",6/28/2020,5.0,"I have been searching for a good Asian eats since moving to Knoxville and this one so far is the best I've found!  Ordered Thai sausage buns, pork bun, Katzu bun, and Balinese shrimp.  You can't go wrong with any of the buns!  Thai sausage had a really good flavor.  Balinese shrimp comes with rich curry flavor and sautéed vegetables.  I highly recommend this place!!!  Currently, they have parking for curbside pick up only.  If they open the dining room, you would need to find parking."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Alexa H.,"Manhattan, NY",9/19/2020,2.0,"We ordered takeout two weeks ago from here. Our order included chicken dumplings, the chicken katsu bun, the Nashville hot bun, and the shrimp bun. We also ordered the Dan Dan noodles.The Dan Dan was so dry and we could not eat more than a few bites. There was no chili sauce or any sauce and there was no flavor to the noodles. We ended up having to throw this away.The dumplings were so wet and cold, it was a huge disappointment. I'm not sure if this had to do with takeout as we live less than 15 minutes away so there wasn't more than 20-30 minutes from picking up the food to eating. The texture was so off and it seemed that they had given us frozen dumplings that turned to mush.The chicken katsu and shrimp bun were largely bun with a small piece of shrimp or a small piece of chewy chicken inside. It was also a disappointment.I'm beyond confused at the reviews for this restaurant because our experience was very poor."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Nicole S.,"Nashville, TN",9/11/2018,4.0,"Ambience: This is a small, local owned Asian-Fusion restaurant in downtown Knoxville. Friendly staff that helped explain some menu items. Quiet atmosphere. Has take out.    Parking: a few metered spots out front & a garage across the street. Food: I ordered the Crows Nest & Takoyaki. The Crows Nest had a heavy soy taste. I know black soy is the sauce they use, but I eat soy flavored things often & this one was just very salty & strong. It was still good & a large portion that had plenty of duck meat in it. The Takoyaki is more an an appetizer that comes with 4 fritters for $6. It was delicious! It was almost similar to a fried risotto ball, but much creamier & had octopus chunks inside. Also covered with pickled ginger, yum yum sauce & eel sauce.I will definitely come back to try the ""buns."""
kaizen-knoxville-2,Diana B.,"Ambler, PA",4/25/2019,5.0,"Good God I love this place. It may be my favorite in Knoxville. This time, I had the crispy eggplant and DAYUM. The bartender was super helpful and friendly; he helped me choose my IPA and it was fantastic (Hotline FTW). Continues to be 5 stars."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Diana B.,"Ambler, PA",4/9/2019,5.0,"Simply incredible. The drinks, the food, the atmosphere. WOW! The Moonshake has an herbal frothy deliciousness, the Lumpia (spring rolls filled with all sorts of awesome) was a perfect start, followed by spicy, golden curry noodles. I'm a fan! Can't wait to get back to Knoxville to eat through the whole menu."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kathleen K.,"New Haven, CT",4/1/2020,5.0,"Don't let COVID get you down! This place is still up and running for carry-out. They have a good system - you order via phone or online and then they bring it out to you after you park in front of their establishment. Safe, easy, and fast! We ordered the pork belly friend rice and lamb belly noods, plus two thai sausage steamed buns. The steamed buns were very small - I actually wasn't expecting them to be that size at all, so I'm glad that I ordered two. However, they were not at all lacking for flavor! Wow, what a unique little snack - my only regret is that the portion was so tiny!The lamb belly noods was just okay. It was very heavily lamb flavored - so if you're all about lamb, this dish would probably be more suited for you! We do like lamb, but this one was just - whew... hello, Lambchop! But it came in a very reasonable portion. However, stop the presses because the pork belly fried rice was absolutely outstanding. It came with a perfectly-cooked egg, a dollop of kim chi (I wish they gave us a little more!) with a little lineup of pork belly (yuuummm!) over a delightful bed of fried rice. It was beautifully well-cooked and crafted. Thanks guys, we will definitely be back!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Brett S.,"Iowa City, IA",5/25/2019,5.0,"The food was amazing!  Everything I tried was really delicious!  So much so, that I went back the next day.  Tried some hot and sour duck soup, steamed buns with different meats in them and some dumplings.  The place is small but they can get you in and out during a business lunch.  The employees were very busy and working very hard."
kaizen-knoxville-2,ashley s.,"Knoxville, TN",10/4/2017,4.0,"Had a few minutes of time before I needed to get back to work so I decided to check out this little gem for lunch.I ordered the Nashville Chicken bun as well as a half order of the pork belly fried rice. Much to my delight, when I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my much anticipated to go order, they had a lunch special for half off the rice!! The Nashville bun was delish! I'm super interested in trying the other options. The pork fried rice.... ohhh my! They certainly hit a home run with that one. The green onions piled to the side, along with the cabbage and fried egg, sensory overload for your tastebuds. A thrill you want again and again. Can't wait to try this place again. Hope to see some soups make it to the winter menu rounds!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Ernie C.,"Portland, OR",5/21/2017,4.0,"I end up at the Hilton once a year for the past 15 or so years, and seeing how this part of town has been gentrifying up has been interesting.  I don't get out too far as I'm usually busy, but then it's been the tried and true standards around here - Pete's Coffee Shop, Chesapeake's, Soccer Taco, etc.  Solid places, but definitely feeling a bit long in the legs.Walked past Kaizen the first day I was in town, making a mental note to check it out later.  The Japanese lanterns out front and the Japanese name made me think it'd be a Japanese restaurant.   A quick look at their website showed they were describing themselves as an izakaya, so I'm thinking small plates, Japanese bar style.  Definitely a bit surprised when I walked in, and the menu is made up of steam buns, kimchi fried rice, mapo doufu, dan dan noodles, pad thai, etc.  The only item that actually looked Japanese on the menu was the takoyaki and the special that day, an oknomiyaki.  Definitely more fusion than Japanese.I ended up ordering two steamed buns (Nashville which was fried chicken based and the Thai sausage), as well as their dan dan noodles (which was chilled lo mein topped with ground pork, soy/vinegar, etc).  I had ordered the buns with a beer, and then ordered the dan dan noodles a little later, so was a little surprised when the noodles came out before the buns.  Not a huge deal, but unexpected and a bit disjointed.  I think the young lady I ordered from was new, since I was asking about the various beer cans they had on display to show their beers, and she had to pull the can down and read it to figure out what it was.  Again, not a big deal in my opinion, especially when I'm not in a hurry and eating alone, but little misses that definitely could add up in forming one's impression of a space.The noodles were good, though could have used some kick.  I did ask for some chili paste and got a little thing of what looked/tasted like some Huy Fong chili garlic sauce.  A nice fermented chili sauce/doubanjiang would probably have been a better fit.The steamed buns were decent - bao could have been a little fluffier, but the Nashville bun was a nice mix of East and West.  Nothing particularly noteworthy nor complaint-worthy about the Thai sausage.I did see the other guy at the bar get the oknomiyaki, and it looked good - generous toppings of bonito flakes and mayo (which I'm assuming was Japanese).  Definitely made me wish I had ordered that.In any case, total damage for the 2 beers I had (draft Sapporo and a can of Bearded Iris Homestyle), buns, and noodles was $25 before tip.In any case, a nice change of pace from the spots I'm used to seeing, and one that I'll likely stop in again next time I'm in town."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Rebecca A.,"Florence, KY",7/12/2019,5.0,"We found this Hideout while at a convention. It's a short walk, for lots of flavors. We will be back."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Caroline L.,"Iowa City, IA",1/18/2020,5.0,"I visited Kaizen on a busy Friday night and was impressed from start to finish. We didn't make reservations, but put our name on the list wandered around downtown. I like when restaurants text when they are ready and we were seated after about 30 minutes. First we each ordered a cocktail. Mine had ginger and yuzu and was so fresh and delicious. My date's had chamomile, thai tea and rum and both were awesome. We split 2 buns for $5. I can't recommend the pork belly bun more. The pork was so flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth. The shrimp was also good, but almost couldn't compare to the pork. The crunchy red peanut noodles were also great. They came with a good amount of shrimp and pork belly, and had a perfect hint of spice. The Balinese fish curry was good, but quite sweet and could have used a little more saltiness in my opinion. Even though we were seated at the bar, it was a very cozy and inviting environment. I would definitely recommend this place, and would encourage everyone to make a reservation and don't miss the pork belly!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Sharon C.,"Tulsa, OK",5/17/2019,5.0,I love the steamed buns!  We got fried rice which was half price that day. It was delicious. It included curry paste.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Brandon W.,"Morehead City, NC",1/21/2019,3.0,"The food wasn't bad, never tried a fusion place. Went here around a year ago with my wife for a ""date.""I prefer traditional Asian foods, but it was good. Kinda small place, we apparently asked too much when we asked the waitress to seat us in the corner away from a large group (loud). Apparently it was not an easy task for her as she rolled her eyes, but reseated us anyway. My wife was kinda agitated with her for it...well yeah it was rude so.Then she did something else I think reached over my wife's food...don't recall exactly so, but my wife isn't too picky with wait staff usually.But yeah. Turns out I believe she was an assistant manager or something like that and so it was useless to even try and comment on the situation at the time. Overall, wasn't impressed enough to go back again. Think it's mostly for urban folks who enjoy fusion type menus and college kids who just want fancy Ramen noodles.Definitely not anything close to what I was really looking for, but the 3 stars were for decent food, took one off for bad service and one off for not being able to talk to a manager/only one there at the time didn't care about their clientel aka business."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Regan A.,"Knoxville, TN",3/2/2020,5.0,"I love the fusion of this restaurant. I find myself craving it often the steamed buns are what I come for usually though their other menu items are great as well. Haven't tried all of them yet but the takoyaki, ramen, and daily chart gong dumplings are great go to's. I love that the steamed buns have a few not so intimidating options of America flair."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kristin W.,"Savannah, GA",1/28/2019,4.0,"Had a great dinner here!  The place is small, so make sure to get their before the crowd.  The food is really good!  I had takoyaki for the first time, which is octopus in fried balls.  Brand new food for me and I loved it.  The steamed buns were beautifully cooked. The only letdown is the service.  Not as friendly or attentive as I prefer- especially for a space as small as this is.  If they improved upon this aspect, it could easily be a 5 star review place."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kristin W.,"Burlington, NC",12/5/2019,5.0,Really impressive place. This was our first time here and would definitely come back. Eclectic menu and everything is delicious.  Balinese fish curry... WOW. All time favorite fish.  And this coming from someone who doesn't usually love fish.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Andrew S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/8/2019,5.0,Kaizen is a true local treasure. Really fantastic and creative Asian fusion dishes served up in a simple and elegant fashion. The flavors are phenomenal and the menu seems to be updated at least every season. The steamed buns are some of the best I've had. Always down for dinner here.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Chance K.,"Knoxville, TN",9/18/2018,5.0,"I've been kicking myself for the past two weeks for waiting so long to eat at Kaizen. I had heard since the month they opened that it was amazing, but for one reason or another never made it in. Now I see the error of my ways.The noodle dishes are fantastic, but the best bang for your buck has got to be the steamed buns. At two for $5, I easily can make a lunch out of two to three, and they come in seven flavors so you can mix and match."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Allen H.,"Mountain View, CA",7/6/2019,5.0,"We are from NorCal.  After one week of great fat boy southern food, we were ready for some lighter Asian fairs.  Kaizen is the best Asian Fusion since Asian Fusion is a thing.  The chef is a genius with pork belly.  It's absolutely amazing in the Pork Belly bun, fried rice and the yakisoba special we had.  The server was polite and attentive without the snotty attitude we get in NorCal.  The appetizer buns are great, only thing missing was the pickled veg in the bun.  Absolutely will visit Kaizen again if we are in this part of country again."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lynda H.,"Castle Rock, CO",6/27/2019,5.0,"Server recommended the cashew chicken. I'm glad I tried it. The perfect blend of spicy chicken with sweet roasted cashews with a craft brew to boot, delicious"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Brian A.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/19/2019,4.0,"Nice place. Small, reservations are a good idea. Dumplings and buns are good. Japanese fried chicken was very good pickles were warm and kinda soggy though , but that might be traditional ‍Chicken mushroom Thai noodles were goodGood service"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Crystal S.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/2/2019,5.0,"We checked this place out with a group of friends. Food was phenomenal! We tried the special spring rolls, a variety of buns, the jungle curry and pork belly fried rice."

kaizen-knoxville-2,Emily L.,"Metropolitan Hill / Beech Street, Boston, MA",5/7/2019,2.0,"The food was delicious. The service was terrible. At first it was great - we were sat right away and service was great during the drinks and food ordering stage. Once we got our food, we were forgotten several times. My water glass was empty for a long time because the bun I got was very spicy. I was told I would get more water several times but had to eventually flag down a server with a water pitcher who was filling the table next to us. We asked for one or two other things - including a side of vegetables- and they took forever or were just forgotten about completely. I'm not swearing off the restaurant but I hope that service in the future won't be as disjointed and unconcerned. It seemed like everyone on the floor was serving everyone and that hurt service because no one had reference for the last time we were checked on or maybe they were trying to keep up with too many different things. I hope my next visit will be better as I intend to try it again."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Pim K.,"Raleigh, NC",5/5/2019,5.0,"We loved it so much we picked this place for our last dinner in Knoxville, TN! We're both a fan of Asian food/flavors and this place is definitely worth the price if you're looking to satisfy your tastebuds. It's not easy to craft a good balance between two very different cuisines (French and Japanese) but Kaizen did a great job. They also switch up the menu once in a while, which I love.The place is rather small but if you don't mind sitting at the bar or having a drink while waiting for a table to open up, you won't be disappointed.Would I go back?Yes, next time we visit Knoxville, we are definitely going here!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Caitlin C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/26/2019,5.0,"My favorite restaurant in Knoxville. I recommend it to everyone. It is VERY small and although they don't take reservations online, you can call and make one. Highly recommend this since space is so limited. They always have specials that are incredible but I can never pass up their steamed buns. I know eggplant doesn't sound like an obvious choice, but it has an amazing sauce. I could eat 5 of them. Pictured is the oyster fried rice (huge portion) and a ramen special. My friend and I got a special chocolate dessert one day and it was delicious as well although I am not sure if they have a regular dessert menu. I can't say anything particularly positive about the ambience or customer service (but not negative either!) but that's how great the food is. Still my favorite restaurant. They are closed sundays and mondays which always leaves me with that ""craving-chickfilA-on-a-Sunday"" feeling."

kaizen-knoxville-2,Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",1/14/2019,4.0,"You definitely want to make a reservation for dinner or you'll be up for the bar if there is a seat available. To my surprise, it does get busy and it should be. A small little establishment with booked out tables and not a seat available at the bar is a good sign.Dinning with a 10month old requires some planning and making a reservation. They are very accommodating to our party that included a baby and a 5 year old. No kids menu but that's no problem. The menu does feature a few GF options and that is always a plus for me. However, the variety of options lack but I'm sure you could ask for some sort of protein to top your fried rice. I ordered the hot and sour duck noodles. Hot? yes. Sour? maybe. Overall flavor was really good and you can definitely taste the umami. The duck confit special with rice and curry was also very good. The bit of kimchi or whatever pickled veg they had garnished on there was a nice touch of acidity. This was ordered specially onionless and it turned out perfect. Not even a single green onion appeared. The nashville and cats bun were too similar in taste for me. Same deep fried chicken but different sauce and garnish. I couldn't speak for the rest of the party but my overall experience was very good and I would definitely go back to check out what is on special."
kaizen-knoxville-2,S. K.,"Bayside, NY",2/29/2020,5.0,Great service and staff. Food was great - good combination of authentic Japanese and fusion.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Natalie V.,"New York, NY",2/19/2019,5.0,"I went to go get one of their buns because I was CRAVING a bao. This was the first time I've even been, and I was pleasantly surprised!! The restaurant is very small, but has a cozy and unique feel. The wait was a little long for the nuns, but they were delicious. We got the pork belly, the Katsu, Thai sausage and the fried oyster. They were all amazing!! My favorite was either the pork belly or the Thai sausage. This is a must try!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",8/12/2018,4.0,This place is so small that you could walk past it and not even notice its there but it's so good! I love the decor with the Asian inspired tattoos on the wall. The variety of Japanese whiskeys is awesome and is def a rarity in Knox. The steamed buns with the pork belly were the best thing I've tried in a while. The crows nest noodle bowl had just the right amount of spice and we also got the daily special noodle bowl which had prime rib and pork belly. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! There are between 10 and 15 tables at the whole place both inside and out and we had really good service. If you're craving something a little different you should give this place a try.
kaizen-knoxville-2,David C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/21/2018,5.0,I could eat here everyday!  If you're familiar with Asia Kitchen on West Knox this place is comparable.  REALLY powerful flavors and super clean feel to the plates.  We came in with a party of 7 and all got different plates.  Everything that I saw looked absolutely amazing.  They also have an insane whiskey and Japanese whiskey selection.  This is not your run of the mill Japanese joint.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Samantha N.,"Knoxville, TN",1/3/2018,5.0,"Perfection, in every form. I was so torn on writing about Kaizen because a very selfish part of me wants nobody to know about this place. After having a fist fight with myself about it, I know the right thing to do when you have a good thing is, to share! So here it is folks, the best place in Knoxville for Crow's Nest Noodles. It being a charmingly small restaurant, get ready to wait for a table. Trust me, its worth it. Whether you are in the mood for a noodle bowl or fried rice, you cannot go wrong. Also make sure you get a couple buns for appetizers too. If I could sleep on them, I would. Once you see them, you'll understand why."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Laura H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/16/2018,3.0,Pros: the steak stir-fry was yummy and I liked the steamed buns we ordered for our appetizer. Also I liked that patio. Cons: Service was lacking. Our waitress forgot a few things and never asked how our food tasted. Kind standard I think. Generally I was underwhelmed.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Garima C.,"Vancouver, Canada",11/8/2016,3.0,"We stopped in Knoxville on a very wrong day, it was weekend and all the restaurants had at least 1 hour of waiting. We finally ended up coming to this place. Even though we appreciate small menus but we wanted more options.We had okonomiyaki , chicken liver gyoza and two kind of buns. The quantity was very small for the money we paid,almost tapas size. But the worst part was the long wait for the food.Almost an hour. The flavors were really  bland, clearly made for American palate, Asian food that Asians won't like."
kaizen-knoxville-2,William M.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",4/20/2018,5.0,"A co-worker recommended Kaizen and they were right! I've been twice now, once for buns and fried eggplant and a second visit for pork belly fried rice. All have been excellent!I love eggplant prepared most anyway and I have found the spicy fried eggplant appetizer here very much to my liking. I get it with a bun or two and it's a big, but enjoyable, lunch.Pork belly fried rice was outstanding too and though I'm not a big kimchi fan I went ahead and got it with my order and even it was good.The lunch special here on Tuesday is half price fried rice so if you are on a budget like I am this is definitely the day to go. Better be there early though because Kaizen fills up fast that day!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jennifer E.,"Knoxville, TN",7/25/2018,5.0,"Love the atmosphere, the staff is always nice, and the food is always amazing. The steamed buns are my absolute favorite! I highly recommend checking this place out."

kaizen-knoxville-2,Christopher C.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",12/27/2019,5.0,"What's not to like about this place!? I keep coming back because the food is good, the atmosphere is cozy and small, & they have good cocktails. The signage out front is small and subtle so you might miss it if you're driving by. My favorite is the pork belly fried rice, but I've tried other items and have enjoyed them all."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Mary K.,"Cardiff, CA",7/31/2018,2.0,"Positives: This restaurant has a great ambience. The steamed buns were fun, and my Market Noodles had just the right amount of spice and amazingly fresh shrimp. Negatives: The servers were not very friendly and could seemingly hardly be bothered with our questions. The Tuesday lamb special was inedible."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lily F.,"Hialeah, FL",11/3/2017,4.0,"Came here for drinks and dinner.  This spot is intimate, cozy and welcoming.  To start we ordered some beers and cold sake.  We took our time and was in no rush.  Eventually we ordered the Nashville Man Bun and the fried oyster bun.  These were so delicious.  The bao buns were fluffy and light.  The fried oyster was my favorite!   We then ordered the dry fried eggplant, dan dan noodles and the daily special dumpling.  The dumplings were filled with pork and lamb.  They were steamed and quite delightful.  The dan dan noodles were tasty.  The ground pork meat mixture was bursting w flavor and the lo mein noodles were great.  The eggplant was the star of the show. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  That dish was outstanding and is a must try!  The service here is also excellent.  They are very knowledgeable about their dishes and make you feel welcome."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Allen H.,"Mountain View, CA",7/6/2019,5.0,"We are from NorCal.  After one week of great fat boy southern food, we were ready for some lighter Asian fairs.  Kaizen is the best Asian Fusion since Asian Fusion is a thing.  The chef is a genius with pork belly.  It's absolutely amazing in the Pork Belly bun, fried rice and the yakisoba special we had.  The server was polite and attentive without the snotty attitude we get in NorCal.  The appetizer buns are great, only thing missing was the pickled veg in the bun.  Absolutely will visit Kaizen again if we are in this part of country again."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Erin W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/5/2019,5.0,"Fantastic spot in downtown Knoxville. The menu is unique and every dish is adventurous and delicious. With the small, quirky atmosphere this place would fit right in among the sought after restaurants in New York or San Francisco, making it the perfect place to impress out of town guests with how cool you are."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Saurabh M.,"Haverhill, MA",4/10/2018,5.0,"UPDATE: Third time here now, still incredible every time - great staff & incredible food. Still working my way through both the food and drink menus, yet to have anything that's not been absolutely heavenly!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Saurabh M.,"Haverhill, MA",2/8/2018,5.0,"Thank you thank you thank you. This has to be one of the best meals I have ever eaten, and I cannot wait to come back to KNX just to come back to Kaizen. Good selection of Japanese whisky and some interesting cocktails to get you in the mood for dinner and oh what a dinner. Had the Knoxville man bun and the pork belly and both were delightfully complex mouthfuls of utter deliciousness. The special of the day was a lamb noodle concoction in a Thai coconut curry and that was just heavenly. How is that not on the regular menu? How does it taste so incredible? What voodoo is this place?I left with another few steamed buns to go for a midnight snack, but I'll be back!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Tom C.,"Mountain View, CA",10/18/2019,5.0,Absolutely delicious. Went with the pork belly fried rice and the Nashville steamed buns.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Greg M.,"Knoxville, TN",7/21/2016,5.0,Thoroughly enjoyed lunch at Kaizen. Don't be intimidated by the menu. The helpful waitress made an excellent recommendation. Food came very quickly. Very good for those with limited time for lunch.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Merrilee G.,"Atlanta, GA",12/18/2019,5.0,Haven't come across something I don't like. The dumplings are amazing and the spring rolls are the perfect ratio.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Thomas W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/8/2019,5.0,"Great quality food in a fantastic location. It gets rather busy so try to hit it at an odd time. The portions are small, and the service is good. Highly recommend for a unique small plate meal."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jake D.,"Metairie, LA",12/21/2017,5.0,"This is the ONLY Dim Sum place I have found in Knoxville. The food is excellent, really coolAtmosphere for a younger crowd and a date night. It's Is very small and tightly packed when it's busy so if you are claustrophobic I would not recommend coming when it's busy. There is outside seating but don't risk it if it's raining I watched everyone get soaked during the rain on my last visit. Although it says kid friendly it is really too small for any car seats or any kid stuff (strollers, bags, etc.) so older kids maybe but not under 4. All in all it is a bomb restaurant. My advice would be make reservation before you go as that's the first thing they ask when you walk In the door due to limited seating!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Alex W.,"Atlanta, GA",4/23/2019,5.0,I come to Knoxville for work twice a year and this is must stop every time.  Really great vibe here and great Asian menu. The food is amazing and the staff has always been very friendly!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Catherine M.,"Dayton, OH",4/20/2019,5.0,"Amazing food and an excellent patio. I had a strawberry and sake cocktail, a katsu bun, the dumpling special (chicken hoisin), and the chicken and mushroom yakisoba. Overall, more than two meals worth of food for me. The bun was amazing, and my cocktail was out of this world. The staff were so kind and helpful. I sat on the patio, which was beautiful. I almost came back, despite only being in town for 5 days."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Stacey L.,"Knoxville, TN",3/16/2019,3.0,All I can say is it was worth a try but I was underwhelmed. The sauces were just a little off. Too gingery and garlicky so that it overwhelmed the rest of the dish. The pork belly steam bun left us both with the aftertaste of sweaty sock.  Eh.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Aek H.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",3/15/2017,4.0,"Great non- sushi Japanese/Asian food.  We were lucky to be here for half priced fried rice so my husband got the pork belly fired rice.  It had big chunks for marinated pork belly, fried egg, kimchi on a bowl of flavorful fried rice.  He loved it.  I got the takoyaki which was ok.  It was not as light on the inside and it was not very hot.  We both got buns too.  His were Katsu and Nashville.  Both with fried chicken.  Mine were pork belly and Thai sausage.  All 4 were delicious.  Will come again."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Christina B.,"Knoxville, TN",3/7/2019,5.0,"This has easily become my favorite date night spot. Make a reservation as the inside is tight and can become busy easily.  The drinks are all amazing. Plenty of vegetarian and seafood options for myself.  The steamed buns are what I dream of, I always get the fried oyster steam bun and my boyfriend loves the pork belly bun.  My favorite dish so far has been the oyster fried rice. drooling now."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Andrew B.,"Soddy-Daisy, TN",6/29/2018,5.0,Food was excellent  loved the dumplings. The waiter was kind antitive and on 5The ball.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Whitney C.,"San Francisco, CA",8/26/2020,4.0,"I have not been here since before the lock downs, but this place was always great! the staff was friendly and the food was always perfect !"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jason L.,"Louisville, KY",12/20/2016,5.0,"Wow, don't be deceived by the simple menu. The portions are good prices are great and quality is unmatched. I recommend the Steamed sandwiches, and either a half fried rice or a bowl of soup. Can't wait to come back and try something new. Don't leave without having the passion fruit tart, think I'll just order 4 of those when I return//"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Mengya L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/7/2019,5.0,"Always wanted to check out this place but never get chance until recently. We went on a Sat evening without reservation, and the waiting time for us is 25 min, which is fine. It's very hard to find parking nearby on weekend, but some free parking garages within 10 min walk are very accessible. We got a Nashville Man Bun and a Thai Sausage Bun, both are fantastic! One thing to warn is if you can't handle spicy ness, be really careful ordering the Nashville Man Bun. It's super good but it is really spicy! I got the Dan Dan Noodles and my friend got their Instagram famous soba noodles with scallops. My Dan Dan noodles is really good, tasty, and spicy, and it's cold noodles made perfectly for summer season. Again, if you can't handle spicyness, you can ask them to put the chili oil as a side as an option. My friend's soba noodles is also great! The scallops are huge, juicy, and super tender! Our service is really sweet. The ambience level is slightly high, but eating outside at the patio can also be a good choice. Overall loved everything here!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Evetty S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/24/2016,5.0,"AMAZING!!!! Chef Jesse does a lot of community work for Austin East Magnet High School Culinary Arts program so I had to support his restaurant. I brought 2 friends with me and it was delicious. The drinks were tasty, the STEAMED BUNS ARE TO DIE FOR! We all had fried rice which tasted like it came straight from Asia! The ambiance was great and service was lovely!My new favorite restaurant in Knoxville!  I want to go everyday!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Danny N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",9/24/2017,5.0,Kaizen was above and beyond what I expected.  I went with my wife and father and ordered several apps and main courses for everyone to share.  To begin I ordered the dumping special which was a pork belly with oyster sauce and 4 of the different bao options.  Both were on par with a big city offering.  For main courses I ordered an udon noodle duck dish which has the perfect level of spice.  Also the kimchi pork belly fried rice was money.  The cold dan dan noodles are what were the easiest to eat for an American pallet.  I thought everything was amazing. This was the best Asian fusion food I've had in Tennessee.  I live in Nashville and everything would have been 50% more expensive and probably not as good.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Michael M.,"Fayetteville, NC",1/31/2019,5.0,This place was extremely tasty.   The steamed buns were not what I expected but surprisingly delicious.  For the main course I had the golden curry shrimp and pork noodles which was bursting with flavor. I especially liked the pieces of pork belly in this dish. I will return.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lynda H.,"Castle Rock, CO",6/27/2019,5.0,"Server recommended the cashew chicken. I'm glad I tried it. The perfect blend of spicy chicken with sweet roasted cashews with a craft brew to boot, delicious"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Solyanaa G.,"Mount Juliet, TN",3/12/2017,4.0,"Kaizen never disappoints, the menu is very easy to read for vegetarians and gluten free dieters. The red curry squash is sooo delicious (vegan friendly)"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Vanessa N.,"Norcross, GA",5/1/2017,2.0,"I don't understand the hype.  I normally have an open mind when it comes to Asian Fusion food, especially when the chefs are creative. However, it almost just fell completely flat. The only good thing from this place are the baos (not buns! Get it right!). Since when does Pad Thai warrant a $17 price tag?  We left very underwhelmed and disappointed."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Tiffany W.,"Henrico, VA",7/20/2016,5.0,New place with great service. Decor was nice and met expectations of an Asian restaurant. Beer selection was minimal but the prices were much cheaper than back home (DC/VA). My colleagues had Okonomiyaki which he absolutely loved and said he would definitely order again. I had the glass noodle soup which was tasty but I left still hungry - wish I had a bit more. Overall a solid place to eat with some different menu options that you won't find most places. They are doing a great job to only have been open 1 month
kaizen-knoxville-2,Ian G.,"Knoxville, TN",8/13/2016,3.0,"We had the okinomayaka, variety of steamed buns, bokchoy, eggplant, fried rice, noodles with vegetable,... in a nutshell interesting flavors at times overwhelming...i liked the eggplant appetizer and the steamed buns were also tasty and interesting. Fried rice well i grew up in a large northern metropolitan area and am used to great fried rice theirs was just ok, the okinomayaka was a good dish, bok choy very heavy on the tumeric and i didn't like it...The dishes at this restaurant are basically rice or noodles, not much veggies, and little or no animal protein. If you're not a vegetarian you'll be hungry a couple of hours later. I think in order for a restaurant in the downtown area to survive and be competitive they can't charge too much for a dish, and to afford the rent  they must keep the food  ingredients on the cheap. Probably not a restaurant i will return anytime soon."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Alison H.,"Saint Paul, MN",1/12/2017,5.0,"Oh my.  Clearly the most delicious meal I have had in long, long while!  The pork belly fried rice was the perfect savory treat.  Can't wait to return to Knoxville for another selection from their brief and intriguing menu."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Mike D.,"Knoxville, TN",9/20/2017,5.0,"Outstanding.Great food. This is probably some of the best food I've seen in Knoxville.Super fresh. Everything here is created with care. If Anthony Bourdain were visiting Knoxville, I'd send him here."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Ben C.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7/29/2017,5.0,"Very good food. Service was delightful.I bit loud for me.Can sit outside would be quieter.We had 4 delicious meals and shared them. Seats were not very comfortable for me, wife sat on the soft seats along the wall.Will come back"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Joshua K.,"San Francisco, CA",11/26/2016,5.0,"Everything here was absolutely phenomenal. Service, food, unique sake and HOUSE MADE HOT SAUCE!! Can't believe this place exists in Knoxville! So in love  Kampai!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Becky B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/14/2017,5.0,Dan dan noodles! Fried fish rice...must I go on??? Its legit Korean food. Must try if you are in the downtown area..I hear the lunch menu is a little bit on the cheaper side. We took friends here for a double date dinner and they loved it. Menu has great vegetarian choices too.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kristen W.,"Knoxville, TN",3/6/2020,5.0,What dreams are made of. The buns are heavenly. Get the Dan Dan's. They're chilled. Super gluten friendly.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kate G.,"Knoxville, TN",2/29/2020,5.0,"I am a local and this is one of my favorite places to eat. If you have no taste buds and only want great service this isn't the place for you. If you value food good more than good service then this is the place for you. Basically, the food is incredible but the service is pretty bad. I've tried a lot of the menu and loved everything."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Erika E.,"Knoxville, TN",3/16/2017,5.0,Kaizen is fantastic. The food is so well made and delicious. Love the kaiju themed cocktails and the wooden chopsticks. The kind of place I will relish revisiting and trying multiple items on the menu when I do make it in to Knoxville and downtown. Highly recommended the Mapo Doufu. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options.  Had a blast here and want to return!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Thao T.,"Hendersonville, TN",12/4/2017,4.0,"Buns and beer!! This sweet, little izakaya (Japanese drinking house) was something I did not expect to ever find in Knoxville. It really is *little* so large parties.. consider making a reservation. They also have a patio! The intimate environment is really set off by the full, but particular bar. I noticed quite a few Japanese whiskeys and a ton of other uncommon items. Service overall was also on point.The mixed drinks menu was extensive and really creative. I had a Sapporo on draft and it was only $2.50! I suppose it might have been happy hour or something because the menu said $3.50, which is still an awesome price.We ordered 3 buns, the Nashville Man Bun, the Thai Sausage Bun, and the Pork Belly Bun. They were all sO good! Each flavor was well developed and they were not scared to add the authentic heat in the Thai Sausage bun. The actual bun was bouncy, just how I remember steamed buns should be. They are 2 for $6 or $3 each. Very affordable and filling if you get a couple.As far as the entrees, I was less than impressed. The Dan Dan noodles were not very flavorful, just oily. The Cheesy ramen was fun, but it is a cheese flavored broth instead of the gooey-cheesiness often depicted in trendy Asian foods. I also tried a little of the Twice Cooked Lamb Belly.. I'm not sure I like lamb in the first place, but the flavor was okay. They do offer vegan and vegetarian options for food as well!As I said in the beginning, buns and beer!! The main entrees are typical for market square (a tad overpriced and underwhelming) but that wasn't enough to bring this rating down. Kaizen would be a really fun spot to bring friends and family or a date to experience something new."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Morgan F.,"Knoxville, TN",7/2/2016,5.0,"I tried lunch to-go earlier this week and just came back from sit down lunch today. Great, very attentive service. The food is fantastic. As a vegetarian, I love that there are tons of options to choose from. I can't wait to bring a bunch of friends here and just order one of each from the menu. The Vietnamese coffee is also delicious. I also love the renovations to the space. When the location was prior restaurants,  this felt dark and cramped with uncomfortable seating. This is now light and open. The Japanese movie posters surrounding the space are also fun. Kaizen has quickly become one of my favorites downtown and I wish them tons of success. Looking forward many future visits."
kaizen-knoxville-2,SmarieinTN B.,"San Francisco, CA",2/23/2020,2.0,"I never do this but since these reviews are what drove me to the rest. in the first place, I felt obligated. My house cocktail was served in a champagne glass. There were like six ingredients but all I tasted or saw was the pear puree. Not a lot of room in the glass for anything else I suppose so I drank a 9$ jar of baby food. Not even a garnish on this glass? Just a little champagne glass filled with bland puree. The lady who is raving about air fried egg plant needs to get out more I suppose. It was literally a bowl of French fry looking crispy flavorless eggplant with no dipping sauce. wow. The buns or whatever is 2 for 5 is a small doughy snack smaller and less tasty than a slider at Chilis. We ordered the special because well its the special. I wish I had taken photos. It was like panang curry from stir fry café but watered down, twice the price, and only two stark white rubbery flavorless shrimp in the giant dilute bowl. Only Not Watsons has ever given me cause to smile in Market Square but regardless of these reviews, there is a plethora of fantastic Asian food to be had in Knoxville.  Have you had the beef satay or the duck at Surin of Thailand. Go have the spicy noodles at Stir Fry café. Ive been eating it for over 20 years and it is craveable awesome. For that matter the twice cooked pork and hot and sour soup and shrimp with snowpeas dishes at Szechaun Garden in South Knox blow anything you are going to overpay to eat here out of the water.Further the cocktails at Surin are really something special. Like this place claims to make. They actually deliver. There are at least two other rest. I cant remember their name in west knox alone that put this food to shame. I want to say little Bangkok and lemongrass thai. Surin grows a lot of their herbs on site if you need to know more about how kickass they are. Please don't judge Knoxville by this place it is so far from the yummy stuff you could be eating. And you could actually hear the conversation at your table too as an added bonus. Youll wait in the cold to eat here but not because its so dang great but rather it has a tiny dining area. Sorry but it could have been so much more."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Susan P.,"San Diego, CA",9/1/2016,4.0,"How to eat here is a great question, start with a steamed bun each and share bites. Between nibbles, pick at least 1 cold dish for 1 to 2 people, double for more, and drink Sapporo while you wait. It won't take to long, but just long enough. Then revel in the chilled Dan Dan or chilled soft tofu squares. I went full Japanese, picked up the plate, and slid the last little fermented black beans in my mouth properly. Whew are they salty, but in the summer they remind me of an ocean wave hitting full blast. Cool, tangy, sweaty bullets of black suns.Muse over two hot dishes to round it out, satiated from the edge of hunger you won't find yourself rushing at this point. Laugh, talk, debate, pick the ones you want. Slow down into an experience. Order a second Sapporo if there's any conflict to stall the decision.I had the best time here, and can't find anything to say that is a real problem. I do want to see the little basket of hot chili oil, siracha, and soy sauce. I found my usual eating habits at asain restaurants getting the better of me, wanting a little more spice here or extending a sauce further there. It's so common I didn't realize it was missing until halfway through.The menu has changed since the last few reviews I saw, and I felt that was good, yet a tease. We wanted the soba noodles that were on yelp, but they were gone already. I should have gone more often! The individual plates are also very small, square, and have a small ridge, where I am used to an individual small soup bowl for anything where you share rice. Found it fairly awkward to deal with some dishes without a serving spoon too. You get your chopsticks all up in each other's business. I eat the food though, not the dishes. Give little tweeks, proper family-style serving-ware, a spicy tray of fun sauces to sample, and it will kick this to 5 with no question. Dim Sum brunch... please?"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Naomi C.,"Denver, CO",7/18/2018,4.0,"This is a small, high end place tucked away in the downtown area. Very delicious , authentic food, although a bit high prices for my wallet more than once a month. The service was excellent and the food unique. Take a chance and see for yourself."
kaizen-knoxville-2,S G.,"Knoxville, TN",8/31/2019,5.0,Amazing flavors and great service. Will definitely return again. Everything was over the top. Best Asian food this side of Asia
kaizen-knoxville-2,Nandini S.,"San Francisco, CA",7/23/2019,1.0,"I ordered the dry fry eggplant here as the starter. It was so salty that it was simply inedible and I thought it could have been just a simple mistake. So I called the server and mentioned to her that I did try to eat it but the salt was simply beyond acceptable for anybody. She refused to agree and tried to convince me that it is supposed to be  - ""savory' and tried to explain to me what savory meant.  However I told her that I would order something else and still pay for this. So she mentioned the buns and said that the eggplant buns are great. I went with her suggestions and guess what she brought me out the same but fewer (4-5 pieces) of ""dry fry eggplants"" stuffed in a bun. I figured they either didnt like me being there or the place simply serves salty and bad food.I would seriously suggest that the owner put a poster out if they dont like people of certain color or ethnicity to eat at their restaurant. The servers clearly didnt want me to be around from the moment I entered the restaurant. Bad food and bad service!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lindy Y.,"Brentwood, TN",10/28/2016,4.0,"It's different from the places I've been, not a lot of options. The food was good, nothing really stood out to me. The buns that had were pretty good. I got the Dandan noodles and my friend got the mapo Dofu. We enjoy both dishes, but it wasn't anything that stood out to us. The service was kind of slow, but we didn't mind too much"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Dylan P.,"Knoxville, TN",5/18/2017,4.0,A really interesting restaurant that sells good portioned food with good tasse. A must try.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Leroy S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/1/2020,5.0,Absolutely one of my favorite places to eat in Knoxville. It's a very small place but that doesn't concern me. The food is amazing. I find myself ordering the special of the day quite a bit but I have never been disappointed by anything on the menu. My wife and I enjoy the fact that they aren't on market square. This place is a can't miss spot!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jamie L.,"Ferndale, MI",9/22/2018,4.0,"The food has a lot of flavor in the best way possible. There is a lot of variety and it's a very good menu. Everything was cooked well, the noodles the right texture, sauces on point, squishy baos. Our waiter was nice and gave good recommendations. Their cocktails were good but honestly the food pairs better with beer. Not my favorite for ordering a bunch of food and sharing but doable. The baos were easy to split and the dumplings too. The place really stands out in downtown Knoxville for its unique flavors. It's also cute inside. It seems like they do rotate things in and out as specials so I would definitely come back to see what they come up with."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Chelsea B.,"Knoxville, TN",11/8/2019,5.0,"Mom and pop place so sometimes the service is a little slow, but the food is great! Give this place a try!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jeana H.,"Providence, RI",8/17/2018,5.0,"Kaizen never disappoints! The atmosphere is a break from traditional restaurants. When I stopped in last night, I told myself I would try something new, but I always end up with my standard order- the dan dan noodles and two Nashville man buns. Every dish I have tried here is spectacular."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Andrea G.,"Frederica, DE",1/27/2018,5.0,"Absolutely wonderful food. I got the lemongrass noodleswhich has pork belly and shrimp. It was one of the best meals I've had in the seven years that I've lived here. It was spicy but complex, with curry, Thai chili and cashews. We also had two of the Japanese sticky buns- the Nashville & the pork belly."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Nicky L.,"Lexington, KY",10/19/2019,5.0,"My husband said, ""it's damn good!"" We came in here after a recommendation from a friend and we were so impressed! I got the spicy thai cashew chicken and I was blown away - there was so much flavor! My husband got the Shrimp and pork belly curry and both were amazing - the broth was so tasty. My only complaint is the music.. it was kind of ""gangster rap"" and just didn't fit the scene well. We ignored it and enjoyed our meal though!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Alex H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/22/2017,5.0,"We started with the Thai sausage, Nashville, and pork belly steamed buns, they were all delicious but the Thai really hit the spot. If you're looking for something fantastic and different, this is your spot. I had the shrimp fried rice with kimchi and it was amazing. My girlfriend had the lemongrass noodle and it was also dank. They have a good selection of wine and sake as well. Highly recommend!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Misty B.,"Lorton, VA",7/12/2018,5.0,"Excellent ! Steamed buns are perfect. I always compare the ones I eat to the ones I ate in Las Vegas and they never surpass the ones I have had - these are close! Yum and worth the stop in just for those. I had the special - a potato cake with pineapple, egg, green onions and bacon. It was very good. Hubby had the crows nest - it was full of flavor and lots of great vegetables. I would recommend that for sure. Son had the dumplings - listed as an entree I wished I would have known there were only 4 small ones. He was good as he ordered the steamed pork bun! Yes ... I think I could live off those things! So, in short - stop and get a variety of flavors of pork buns and you won't be disappointed."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Keith L.,"Knoxville, TN",7/11/2018,5.0,"Have been following them on Instagram for months finally stopped in, so happy we did. Like a place you'd find in San Francisco. Price was great. The flavors amazing. Dessert was perfect. Dined outside, perfect night thank you!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,David T.,"Regency At Palisades, Charlotte, NC",10/1/2019,5.0,The food was excellent. I had the jungle curry. This is a spot that locals frequent but was great for an out of town visitor staying nearby at the Hilton. Highly recommended.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Joanne L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/28/2018,5.0,"Really interesting Asian fusion menu. I had the dry fry eggplant and it was terrific.  Hubby had the duck and noodle special - scrumptious. Sitting out in the patio on such a lovely day on Union St....couldn't ask for more. Service was exceptional, too. Nicest waitress ever!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kurlan B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/24/2018,5.0,"This place is amazing. Can't believe it took me so long to find it, but I'm so glad I did! Their food is great and every plate I try I'm surprised as to how good their whole menu is. 10/10"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Janine A.,"Knoxville, TN",2/9/2018,5.0,"This place is worth a visit. The food is reasonably priced, delicious, and the service is always impeccable. You'll probably need a reservation for dinner service!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kathryn C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/30/2017,4.0,"The place is really small, however, when we went, it wasn't too busy. The jazz music was a little loud and intrusive but after a few minutes you don't really notice. It has a bar and a wide variety of American and Japanese alcohol, so if you're looking for a buzz it's a good place to go. The food is pretty good, but the serving sizes are pretty big. Also, if you get anything with duck, you will fill up quickly. Service is really quick and the servers are very polite. You will get chopsticks by default, but the servers understand if you want a fork or spoon. The atmosphere is a little dark, but it sets a nice mood. Really good for a romantic date. We got Crowsnest Noodles, Lemongrass Noodles, Nashville Buns, Porkbelly Buns, some dumplings, and takoyaki. It was all great food, and we had plenty of left overs and it was all pretty cheap. We spent about $74 (we are a family of 4) and thats pretty good for a fancy restaurant. We plan on going back soon, but maybe order a little less food"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Eddie W.,"Farragut, TN",8/24/2018,5.0,Awesomeness on a plate.  Great atmosphere in the small restaurant.  The food is top notch. Great flavors using high quality food. The steamed buns are some of the best I have ever had I recommend the Thai sausage.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Katey G.,"Old Sevier, Knoxville, TN",8/7/2019,5.0,"One of our favorite places in town! Amazing staff, quality food, and great drinks. I can't say enough about how amazing the people who work here are. Kitchen staff included."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Robert P.,"Alcoa, TN",8/10/2017,5.0,"My son picked me up and said he wanted to treat me to lunch, so how could I complain about any free lunch? Had no idea what I was ordering, but waiter was helpful. I wanted to try everything. Started with steamed buns, shares some dumplings and I went with the Don don noodles (didnt see the extra spicey label) because its served cold and because I knew I could take anything home for leftovers. Loved everything. Definitely did not need that much food. Recommend sharing some steamed buns or dumplings with someone and ordering one of the amazing bowls or plates. Highly recommended and will return."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Joan M.,"Louisville, KY",3/28/2017,3.0,"Really lovely looking menu and nice drinks. Portions small and grainy stuff in the Bok Choy made my teeth hurt. They were busy so they'd run out of the squash that was supposed to go in the dish, the waitress was nice. My companions got food that looked good but could have used better/fresher vegetables."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Emily D.,"Knoxville, TN",4/28/2017,2.0,"I had heard great things about Kaizen and was super excited when my husband chose it for dinner. Unfortunately, we both walked away underwhelmed. As others have mentioned, the buns were pretty good. The Thai sausage bun was our favorite.The downfall was with our entrees. My husband ordered the Pad Thai but the only resemblance it held to pad thai was that it contained noodles. There was zero flavor to this dish. Very disappointing especially considering the $17 price tag. I understand that this is fusion cuisine, but I expected the ""fusion"" to enhance the dish not make it worse. I ordered the daily special which contained cheesy ramen, duck, quail eggs, and tomatoes. This was much better than the Pad Thai in terms of flavor, however it was so rich that I could only eat a handful of bites before I was done. The service was fine and the atmosphere was okay (I appreciate that they have a patio), but we walked away disappointed and regretting having spent so much money on food we didn't even really like. There are much better Asian restaurants in Knoxville."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jessica C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/31/2017,5.0,We've been here three times and are huge fans! The food is unique and delicious. I've been craving the Tom Yum soup everyday since I had it. We will definitely be back - each time with friends in tow.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Silvana P.,"Knoxville, TN",11/10/2018,5.0,"This might be my favorite restaurant in Knoxville. Service is good (and I have a kid), and the food is fucking awesome. My partner and I are kind of snobs when it comes to food, coming from Chicago, and the first time I took him here, he told me after ""this might be the best Asian fusion"". Maybe it was just an in the moment comment, because their food is actually delicious, but still thought I should add. All of the servers seem to be down to earth, not over the top (thank fucking god), and they know their shit. 10/10 would recommend and return"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Tara S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/8/2016,5.0,"So happy about this place. I really loved the curried bok choy and Thai fried rice. for two people, 3 dishes is just about right; if you are really hungry or want a larger dinner, make it 4. There's a nice little bar and this building features one of my all-time favorite downtown patios. All of the food was so fresh and prices are really excellent. I will be back many times."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Raz A.,"Sewell, NJ",9/23/2017,5.0,Had good food & the price was pretty reasonable & we went on a weekday so it was very quiet the are. But they have a patio where we all sat & enjoyed the food.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Pam R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/28/2017,5.0,"Kaizen is my favorite place downtown to eat lunch by myself. Love their little bar. Servers are extremely helpful and nice. They offered suggestions for menu items that are lower in carbs. Excellent and beautiful presentation. Thank you, Kaizen for a great experience every time."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Ross M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/19/2016,2.0,"High prices for the l small portions, and not particularly good food. I don't quite understand why the ratings are so high. The food was good but it wasn't good enough to justify the pricing."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Crystal S.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/2/2019,5.0,"We checked this place out with a group of friends. Food was phenomenal! We tried the special spring rolls, a variety of buns, the jungle curry and pork belly fried rice."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jennie B.,"Lone Tree, CO",2/12/2018,5.0,This place is incredible!! One of a kind!!! Great mix of Japanese and Korean and the waiters all know what they are talking about and are able to recommend great things! I had a ginger grapefruit sake beer which went well with the eggplant buns - a must have!! I am vegetarian so the fried rice was an easy choice. Spicy and delicious with plenty of flavor. Would definitely go back!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jay E.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2016,4.0,"On my first visit, I brought my Constant Dining Companion and Bestie. Here's how our feast played out--  Sapporo on draft: slurrrrrrp! AAHHHHHHHHH! Steamed buns: one with crispy chicken, another with seared eggplant- yum! Dry-fried Eggplant: perfectly fiery and crisp outside, creamy and delicate inside, nothing else could ever compare! Dan Dan noodles: cold and spicy and bold and savory and tender (and just a bit too greasy). General Tso's Octopus (sounds like a lost Beatles song) fairly average, too-sweet sauce saved by the presence of baby octopi, though the portion is terribly small for the price. Veggie Gyoza with a miso-tofu dipping sauce-- the pickled veg coupled with the miso left a distinctly funky aftertaste (unfortunately reminiscent of dirty socks in old dishwater), and this was the one dish that wasn't top-notch in our bounty of Asian delights. Did I mention the Coconut Rice Pudding? A complete revelation in dessert experiences: not the traditional bowl of glop, this beauty is an Asian mise-en-plate dream: a thick square of dense-but-buttery rice pudding topped with a layer of coconut cream reduction and a gorgeous purple dollop of (what I think is) bean paste, all resting on a smudge of dark caramel. AAAWWWW-- the textures and flavors are subtle, sumptuous, and combine to make the perfect ending to an almost-perfect meal... our server almost caught me licking the plate.The only major problem at KI is the overwhelming, overpowering smell of the over-heated deep fryer. The former occupant (or several of the former occupants) had this exact problem, and better ventilation must be the answer. I would only go back when it's cooler outside to dine on the patio or to order take-out. My eyes and lungs can't tolerate the fog of greasy air, and I had to immediately throw everything I was wearing into the washer when I got home. But I'm still dreaming of that Dry-fried Eggplant and the heavenly Rice Pudding..."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Joseph D.,"Floyd, VA",11/16/2017,5.0,"SO GREAT!!! I've been here twice and everything about this little place is fabulous.   We had the lemongrass noodles, steam buns, dumplings, potatoes and the pickled bean tofu dish, all of which were outstanding.   Just when I thought it couldn't get any better I got a bite of tamari soaked ginger at the bottom of the potato dish.   Nice atmosphere... sat outside the first time and inside the second time.  The music is not too loud and The wait staff was friendly and super accommodating, picking up that my older dinner guests might not be hip to superspicey and placing the fresh hot sauce to the side of the lemongrass dish.   And the Creme brûlée with Vietnamese coffee and lemon topping was the perfect finish."
kaizen-knoxville-2,John C.,"Atlanta, GA",12/8/2016,5.0,"This place is amazing. Dan Dan Noodles are the best item on the menu, but I would recommend asking about any specials they might have. I have had several of their specials, and they have always had amazing flavor. If you want Asian cuisine downtown, this is the place to go."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jesse M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/9/2018,5.0,New to Knoxville. Came here because some friends told me about it. I got the Crows Nest. It was unbelievable. Super tasty
kaizen-knoxville-2,Siva K.,"Jackson, MS",8/13/2017,5.0,A great Asian fusion restaurant. Best in Knoxville so far.  Try the eggplant bun or any bun as a starter! All of their entree's are great. You should definitely try their ginger mixed cocktail!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kelsey H.,"Newark, CA",3/8/2019,5.0,"The eggplant steam bun and oyster steam bun were delicious! The mushroom fried rice was also really good, and I got it during half price fried rice, which was a bonus!! The restaurant itself was small, but very cute."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Martin H.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",6/22/2017,5.0,We only tried the buns but they were fantastic. Eggplant bun is incredible. Everything on the menu looks delicious. We'll be back!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Michelle C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/20/2016,4.0,"Very unique but tasty selections of Asian cuisine. Some dishes are definitely more spicy than others. The ""buns"" selections were good especially the rib eye. The eggplant appetizer was different--a touch salty but good. The pancake dish with the fried egg was an excellent combination of flavors."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Margaret H.,"Richmond, VA",3/23/2019,5.0,Noodle dishes are amazing. I have no idea what the spices were but I loved them. Definitely Japanese with a twist! Atmosphere was good. Will definitely go back.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Rebecca L.,"Irving, TX",11/7/2018,1.0,"Terrible service ruined our dining experience.   Food was average to good, but we won't return due to the rude, poor service."
kaizen-knoxville-2,John L.,"Kimberton, PA",9/6/2017,2.0,"The service was very good. We waited for a table due to a crowd, which was no problem at all. We tried the dumpling special of the day. It was pretty good. I had 4 steamed buns, 1 of each meat variety. I did not enjoy them. I felt the sauces clashed with the meat flavors. The rest of our group felt the Dan Dan noodles were too spicy, the fried rice was OK, and the desserts were good, minus the citrus topping which clashed with the vietnamese coffee creme brulee. Also, one person asked for a spoon to eat the rice with, but they only had Chinese soup/duck spoons, so it was funny watching them eat. OK selection of vegetarian and vegan dishes for those that need it."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Brooke J.,"Alexandria, VA",3/3/2017,4.0,"I was attending a conference just a block away and wandered in here for lunch after spotting the lanterns on the walk back to my hotel the night before. This is a tiny restaurant, so be prepared to wait for a table. The ambiance and size reminded me a bit of Papa Giovanni in Rome. If you sat any closer to the kitchen, you'd be in it.This definitely has a Southern twist to Asian dishes. The service is as knowledgeable and as quirky as the decor. Two words: Nashville Bun. The bun is made in house. The meat oozes juice and flavour over your plate. If you're wearing a nice shirt, proceed with caution. I only ordered one, you'll want to order two. They are small, like they should be. They pack a wallop for their size. It's a party on your tongue, and pretty much everything on their well tended drinks menu will pair nicely. I also got the takoyaki. One of mine was just right. I've been the person on squid on the fryer. It can only be controlled so well. I feel like if they dice theirs just a wee bit smaller, you can still get the telltale gum of the octopus without it overwhelming the tempura shell.With the showing on both of these small plates, it wouldn't have been right to pass up on dessert. They had lost quite a bit of business on an unlucky customer rotation, so I felt like I owed them one. Yeah, that's the ticket. It definitely wasn't because the chocolate pie was a delicious option. Just like any Southern BBQ pie shell, this thing busted into a million pieces the second you looked at it sideways. If these aren't homemade, they're bought in from someplace that's home baking them."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Aubrey M.,"Gainesville, FL",2/3/2017,5.0,"Solid A. Flavorful, unique food options, fast service. I was really surprised at the variety of flavors in the 4 things that we ordered."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Linda M.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",8/16/2017,5.0,This is my go to place! Me and my friends try to meet here at least once a month. I actually found this place by accident but it was a blessing in disguise . Great food and drinks along with a great time!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Melanie R.,"Cincinnati, OH",5/21/2017,5.0,"Everything was WONDERFUL...food, service, atmosphere.  This was our first visit (my husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary) and we could not have picked a better place to celebrate.  We will definitely be repeat customers."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Morgan G.,"Gulf Shores, AL",8/5/2016,5.0,"Great, affordable lunch menu. Great recommendations from staff! Will definitely be coming back."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Raul L.,"Powell, TN",5/18/2017,3.0,"Let me start by saying, I wanted to give Kaizen 4 stars. The place is perfectly sized, cozy and edgy. The food had great flavors all around and we enjoyed it. It was a good birthday dinner for my wife... BUT, if I'm going to pay $17 DOLLARS for Pad Thai.. the noodles better not me over cooked to the point I couldn't use chopsticks to eat it.. I ended up using the spoon that came with the soup. That was such a letdown.. I'll go back but I'll not have the Pad Thai (which is a shame because the cheeks were delicious). Only reason I didn't bring it up was because it was a birthday dinner and I'm just not ""THAT GUY""."
kaizen-knoxville-2,mandy v.,"Louisville, TN",9/20/2016,5.0,So much fun! Great menu for all diets including vegan . A new Knoxville cool spot.Small and intimate.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Edward G.,"Knoxville, TN",8/24/2018,5.0,"Fantastic place, fresh, flavorful, authentic. I always try to stop in for lunch when in BH."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Karlie L.,"Knoxville, TN",1/28/2017,5.0,"LOVE Kaizen! Everything on the menu is very unique- there's nothing like it in Knoxville! Definitely start out with a variety of the steamed buns! All of the entrees are made with fresh, local ingredients. The chef goes to the Market Square farmer's market to get fresh vegetables. The flavors are incredible and extremely different in each entree. There are daily specials and they change the menu about every month! The restaurant is very small, but they do take reservations! A must try!!!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lesley S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/9/2016,5.0,"Really wonderful dinner! Delicious menu. Really good service. The restaurant looks great - inside and out. We sat outside on the porch. Ordered dry fried eggplant, soba okonomiyaki, and the ribs. Everything was delicious & it all looked beautiful. The eggplant had a great slow heat. The okonomiyaki had yummy pickled vegetables and sausage and a perfectly fried egg, and the ribs were crispy and had a fantastic sauce. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. Really reasonable price points. Very excited about this addition to downtown."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Chris M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/4/2016,5.0,We've been here a few times now and it consistently impressed us.  The menu is evolving and specials are slowly making their way to the regular menu.  The waiter informed us about how they are considering developing a shochu cocktail (menu?) which is exciting.  This place will be a regular for us.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Chris M.,"Knoxville, TN",8/20/2016,5.0,"Hopefully this place can break the curse of the location, because it's excellent and deserves to become a Knoxville staple.  We had the Nashville hot chicken steam bun, Thai fried rice, dry fry eggplant and chicken liver gyoza all for 26 dollars.  If you are looking for something different and exciting, this is the place for you."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Sandie J.,"Orange County, CA",7/15/2018,5.0,"My family and I really enjoyed our lunch at Kaizen yesterday.  My husband and daughter both enjoyed their Okonomiyaki.  We really liked our steamed buns that we decided to bring them to eat on our flight back to CA (much better than the airport selections).  We have very good Asian fusion restaurants here in CA and Kaizen is just as good or better.My son cannot eat spicy food and our server AM (sorry, I didn't ask for your name) recommended the eggplant steamed bun and he had the pork belly fried rice minus the kimchi and he was very happy (when my son is happy, it has to be good!). AM was such an awesome server! She was right on with her recommendations and made sure that the steamed buns were wrapped individually and marked so we know the ones each one ordered (to be honest, I didn't really care if they get all mixed up 'coz the buns we ordered were all good. Thai, pork belly, the fried oyster were all delicious!).  From my experience, the people who work there including Paulie (I think he is one of the chefs) seem to be very caring and are concerned with providing a high level of customer service.  I would definitely return if I am in Knoxville."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Tony L.,"Clinton, TN",9/15/2018,5.0,"Excellent experience and food (September 2018). Really well-constructed menu with something for everyone. some spicy, some mild, some veggie, some meat. The dry eggplant was very tasty and a unique dish. Server was helpful in explaining unusual dishes and drinks. Small place, but unhurried. Not cheap. I plan to make it one of my go-to places in Knoxville for gourmet dining."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jason W.,"Knoxville, TN",9/17/2016,5.0,"The food is creative, super fresh, fast and affordable. Love the location and atmosphere."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Michelle F.,"Knoxville, TN",10/8/2018,5.0,"Really good food. I thought it would be Japanese good, but it's not really. It's more a mix of several Asian cuisines. If you're looking for strictly Japanese food, you'll be disappointed maybe. The food is really tasty. Atmosphere is nice."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Teresa W.,"Key West, FL",8/9/2016,4.0,"Kaizen offers a unique experience for this area. It has an intimate atmosphere with attentive and knowledgeable waitstaff. We tried the curry bok choy, the octopus, and both the Thai sausage and fried eggplant buns. All of the food was great. The buns were our favorite! I will dream about those buns tonight. I recommend trying a variety  of dishes."
kaizen-knoxville-2,John B.,"Monroe Township, NJ",6/14/2018,1.0,Just not very good.  Had pork belly fried rice and was average. Dumplings just terrible.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jason A.,"Chicago, IL",11/30/2017,4.0,"Great stuff. I'm eating gluten free these days and the pork belly fried rice was out of this world.  Didn't love the fried eggplant, apparently I'm the only one.  Whole chilis bad.  Anyway, my sake was awesome and everyone there was super friendly.  Thanks!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Shalini M.,"Metairie, LA",4/28/2018,5.0,Make a reservation! Definitely worth every penny! Innovative and delicious. The pork belly fried rice is so unique and flavorful... so many creative dishes... wish I could have tried everything!
kaizen-knoxville-2,Joy R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/8/2018,5.0,"One of the best restaurants in Knoxville, hands down! Always delicious food, amazing staff, and great atmosphere."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kent C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/14/2017,5.0,Had the Dan Dan noodles for lunch and they heated them up for me. Pleasantly spicy. Excellent Restaurant.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Kent C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/13/2017,5.0,"Had the tai sausage and Nashville steamed buns, they were excellent. I also had the pork belly fried rice and it was excellent as well. Cant wait to go back."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Izaak S.,"Charleston, SC",7/1/2016,4.0,"Loved the potatoes, mushrooms with tofu, and Thai stir fry; says the guy who is very skeptical about Asian Fusion. Can't wait to go back."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Sarah K.,"Knoxville, TN",7/1/2017,5.0,"I went to eat here Saturday night with my girlfriend. We walked in about 820pm. The tables were full but there was space at the bar. We grabbed seats and were welcomed by basically the entire staff. We were promptly given menus, and waters, and then offered to order our bar drinks. Our drinks literally were served that moment. Delicious and abundant drink options. I had a grapefruit beer (maybe sake?) drink and my gf had a pineapple IPA. We were left alone for a moment to look over the menu. We had almost decided on our options when another young lady came and asked us if we had any questions and if anyone had told us about their specials. We said no on the specials, so she informed us. In which the appetiser sounded delicious and we both ordered one. We also decided on an eggplant dish that was delicious (it was a tad bit too spicy for my gf, but the menu did note this,  as well as the waiter noted it a second time when the food was dropped off). Once we finished dinner, we were offered dessert options (chocolate mango tartlet pictured below, plated beautifully!) which again was suburb. The app we got we were told contained local veggies picked that day from the local farmers market. Everything was seasoned perfectly. The staff was inviting from the get go, and presented immaculate service up to the very end, when were bid a good night as we walked out the door. I am a restaurant manager at a separate local restaurant, so I know the struggle to ensure an all around great experience for a customer.  I was pleasantly impressed and I would definitely recommend this as a great place to try something new. Great job guys!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lauren B.,"Knoxville, TN",5/29/2018,5.0,"This is my favorite place to eat in Knoxville. I love that the menu changes seasonally and they always have a special so it never gets old. The steamed buns are fantastic, the dumplings are always delicious and the cocktails are great!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Sharon D.,"Knoxville, TN",3/3/2018,3.0,"I was very excited to try this place as my nephew had recommended it. We didn't have reservations so we had to sit outside, which was ok but it was cold. Our waitress was not burdened with a personality which is very rare in eateries in town. We told her we had never been there before and she really had no suggestions. My husband tried to ask her about the different beers and she acted as though she was bored with the whole thing. The steamed buns were delicious. I had eggplant and fried oysters. My main entree was pork belly fried rice. Both items arrived at the same time, so by the time I got to the fried rice it was cold.  The pork belly was very good but the rice was a blob of paste. I ordered a cocktail and my husband ordered a beer when we sat down. The server never returned to ask us if we would like another drink or to refill our water. The young man that brought us our dinner from the kitchen was very nice. We don't plan on returning."

kaizen-knoxville-2,Jamie M.,"Columbus, OH",7/27/2016,4.0,"Kaizen is a great change of pace for Knoxville. Its' menu is Japanese based. I went for dinner with a few others and got to try a few different dishes. I tried the general tso octopus, Okonomiyaki, dan dan noodles, potato starter, chicken steamed bun, and marshmallow dessert tart. My favorite was the Okonomiyaki; it was a Japanese pancake with vegetables, Chinese sausage, and egg on top. The general tso octopus comes in second. The octopus was similar to calamari but less chewy. It was fried very lightly with lite sauce as well. The steamed bun was a great filler for the lighter dish that was the dan dan noodles. The potatoes were alright. The marshmallow tart was also good. It was made with coconut milk and was not as heavy as it sounds. The portions aren't huge, but you should walk away happy,  not bloated. I am happy that a restaurant like this is here. Knoxville has too much of the same in restaurants like: Aubreys, Tupelo Honey, Blue coast grill, and many more american grill eateries. Do not be intimidated by the menu, just go!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Greg M.,"Knoxville, TN",7/21/2016,5.0,Thoroughly enjoyed lunch at Kaizen. Don't be intimidated by the menu. The helpful waitress made an excellent recommendation. Food came very quickly. Very good for those with limited time for lunch.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Tiffany W.,"Henrico, VA",7/20/2016,5.0,New place with great service. Decor was nice and met expectations of an Asian restaurant. Beer selection was minimal but the prices were much cheaper than back home (DC/VA). My colleagues had Okonomiyaki which he absolutely loved and said he would definitely order again. I had the glass noodle soup which was tasty but I left still hungry - wish I had a bit more. Overall a solid place to eat with some different menu options that you won't find most places. They are doing a great job to only have been open 1 month
kaizen-knoxville-2,Wayne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",7/20/2016,4.0,"LET'S TALK ABOUT CHICKEN SKINBut before we do, let me say I think this restaurant is very, very good and I surely hope it has a bright, long-lasting future. From the top, the dry fry eggplant for lunch was special. The diminutive eggplant was cooked with Sichuan peppers, chili oil, sesame oil and topped with fresh parsley and sliced green onions after cooking. Believe I'll order this every time I come here.Next, okonomiyaki was also a real treat. Japanese noodles were made into a pancake with pickled vegetables and Chinese sausage and topped with a fried egg. It had something of a sweet taste which I couldn't trace to its source.Last, the chicken skin noodles were irresistible. Warm Udon noodles were topped with citrus, rice wine vinegar, mushrooms, chicken fat and what was supposed to be ""crispy"" chicken skin. I really love chicken skin as I understand some number of top chefs do since they may say toss the chicken but feast on the skin. Thomas Keller, of The French Laundry & Per Se fame, has a perfect approach to elevating chicken skin to unimagined heights, not to mention numerous other dishes as well. He pats his chicken dry and very thoroughly salts it, puts it in a 450 degree oven for an hour, and out pops ultra crispy, lusciously browned skin wrapped around a moist bird. I don't know how Kaizen's chef cooks his skin, but it was pale gray and on the soft side.But I'm surely returning for stir fried long beans, soba noodle soup with shaved foie gras and pan fried dumplings with chicken liver for lunch. As for dinner, there's an octopus dish I've got my eyes on."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jared B.,"Greencastle, IN",7/16/2016,5.0,"Oh....my....goodness!This place offers more than just amazing food. The ambience, service,  and atmosphere blew me away.  Warm, inviting,  and fitting for the space they have.  They have a small 6 person bar that offer great craft beer on draft, in cans, and bottles.  I suggest a Yee Haw Pale Ale or Dunkel. The food: I had the Dry Fry Eggplant for an appetizer and I was glad I did. Everything was fresh and tasty.  A great starter. (split with my wife)I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles and I fell in love with the first bite. Perfect amount of spice and flavor,  balanced taste with every bite. Good portion but left me wanting more!I then ordered the Yellow Curry Bok Choy with chicken.  The flavor profile was incredible. Never overwhelming, but made me relish the different flavors in every bite. I cannot wait to come back. The service is perfect and they also have a really nice outdoor covered patio to enjoy the downtown feel of Knoxville. This place will continue to amaze its patrons."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Olga N.,"Knoxville, TN",7/13/2016,5.0,"Kaizen is delicious.  The staff is amiable, knowledgeable and driven to create a great experience for their customers.  First visit:  We had the Dry Fry Eggplant, Dan Dan Noodles and General Tso's Octopus.  The boyfriend and I each had a Vietnamese Coffee as well, which packed an appropriate punch.  Given the owner's credentials, I expected our meal to be good, but everything was exceptional.  Second visit:  More of the same!  Great service and great food.  It was really difficult not to reorder the Dan Dan Noodles and Dry Fry Eggplant, but we opted to try all new dishes.  We had the Mapo Doufu, Thai Fried Rice and Chicken Liver Gyoza.  Everything delicious.  We fought over the Thai Fried Rice.  Was so freakin' good.  We stayed and drank a bit this visit-- Lagunitas for $4.50/pint. All the dishes are very creative, and they deliver the perfect amount of heat.  Flavors are clean and unique from any other Asian fare you'll find in Knoxville.  I can't recommend enough, and I can't wait to return.  With prices so affordable, it may very well just become a weekend ritual."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Lesley S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/9/2016,5.0,"Really wonderful dinner! Delicious menu. Really good service. The restaurant looks great - inside and out. We sat outside on the porch. Ordered dry fried eggplant, soba okonomiyaki, and the ribs. Everything was delicious & it all looked beautiful. The eggplant had a great slow heat. The okonomiyaki had yummy pickled vegetables and sausage and a perfectly fried egg, and the ribs were crispy and had a fantastic sauce. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. Really reasonable price points. Very excited about this addition to downtown."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Tara S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/8/2016,5.0,"So happy about this place. I really loved the curried bok choy and Thai fried rice. for two people, 3 dishes is just about right; if you are really hungry or want a larger dinner, make it 4. There's a nice little bar and this building features one of my all-time favorite downtown patios. All of the food was so fresh and prices are really excellent. I will be back many times."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Morgan F.,"Knoxville, TN",7/2/2016,5.0,"I tried lunch to-go earlier this week and just came back from sit down lunch today. Great, very attentive service. The food is fantastic. As a vegetarian, I love that there are tons of options to choose from. I can't wait to bring a bunch of friends here and just order one of each from the menu. The Vietnamese coffee is also delicious. I also love the renovations to the space. When the location was prior restaurants,  this felt dark and cramped with uncomfortable seating. This is now light and open. The Japanese movie posters surrounding the space are also fun. Kaizen has quickly become one of my favorites downtown and I wish them tons of success. Looking forward many future visits."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Izaak S.,"Charleston, SC",7/1/2016,4.0,"Loved the potatoes, mushrooms with tofu, and Thai stir fry; says the guy who is very skeptical about Asian Fusion. Can't wait to go back."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Dee O.,"Knoxville, TN",6/29/2016,4.0,"Most definitely a fan. I loved the menu for its diversity and wanted to try everything on it. Ended up with the dry fry eggplant which was delicious. It had the right amount of heat and loved the texture provided by the breading, cilantro and another green (and tasty) herb I could not identify. The portion was a tad small but I didn't feel like I needed to take a nap after eating. So perhaps one could argue that the lunch portion was ideal. The price was very reasonable. Like for real? $7 for an entree downtown. That will definitely keep me coming back, combined with the fact that the food was delicious. Service was friendly, the ambience was nice. I thought they made good use of the space. I have long been waiting for an Asian restaurant downtown and Kaizen does not disappoint. Highly recommended and I will be back."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kenneth S.,"TN, TN",8/7/2022,5.0,I love fried chicken but until you taste Gus's we'll they take it to a whole other place!! Highly recommend if you love fried chicken!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Joran F.,"Findlay, OH",4/14/2022,5.0,"If you want great fried chicken and a laid back atmosphere Gus's is exactly what you're looking for. The chicken itself is phenomenal, and the sides more than do their part. The slaw and sweet tea in particular are some of the best I've had. Make sure you get there relatively early, they pack the place out pretty quick. Can't wait to visit again!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Sarah M.,"Memphis, TN",8/18/2022,4.0,Delicious meal - options for everyone. Some of the best fries & baked beans I've ever had!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Todd L.,"Crossville, TN",8/26/2022,5.0,"Well, we were a part of a group of about 13 of us from a local Corvette club. One of the members was a fan of Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken in Memphis,  but had never been to the Knoxville store. So he put together a cruise so a bunch of us could give their chicken a try. Id say Gus's lived up to the hype and put out some world famous fried chicken. I loved the taste, the slight spicy heat, the very (perfectly)well done, very light breading, and super moist and tasty meat inside. The sides were all top notch as well. I got bbq beans, and slaw, my wife got collard greens and slaw and I  ordered fried green tomatoes as an appetizer,  and all were super tasty and good size portions.  My 2 piece meal with sides was $10.95........... cant beat that!!!!!! Cant wait to take friends and family there!!...... BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,James R.,"Charleston, SC",9/1/2022,5.0,Stopped in a couple days ago while traveling through Knoxville area. This is my new go to Chicken spot when Im in town. Tender and juicy fried chicken with a perfect blend of spices!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ryan W.,"Clovis, CA",7/29/2022,5.0,"Ok, we are from California and this was my family's first time in Tennessee. We were looking for a good Southern fried chicken place and boy did we find one! This place served the absolute best fried chicken I have ever eaten. It was amazing. The fried pickles were great too and my son loved the Mac N Cheese!! Highly recommend!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Marcia W.,"Knoxville, TN",9/1/2022,5.0,"The chicken speaks for itself. It reminds you of homemade put that little tickle on your tongue from the hidden space sets it apart from anywhere else. Since we always have cool sides at home, we usually just order the meat, and it totally makes our meal special. Can't go wrong here because they really know that bird!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Alexis B.,"Lebanon, OH",7/19/2022,4.0,"Pretty good, chicken tenders had a great flavor with a little spice. LOVED the slaw, and the sweet tea and souvenir cup. Great little place, nice atmosphere, and kind staff. Beans were beans. Mac and cheese was just okay, noodles tasted a little overcooked, but still good. Overall, would recommend!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Lea G.,"Camas, WA",5/6/2022,5.0,"There are so many great reviews for this place. The reason is it's terrific! From the very extra crunchy flavorful chicken, to the side dishes like collards and Fried okra to the delicious mac & cheese. Among many others. This is serve the old-fashioned way on white  bread. I loved that. Also I can't say enough about their pies -So delicious. There are so many wonderful reviews and pictures of this Place. Check them out. There are several locations I'm sure there's one near you."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Harry A.,"Kodak, TN",1/1/2022,5.0,"My wife and I have heat great things about Gus' for years and finally stopped in for lunch.We started with fried green tomatoes.  They were tender with a crunchy breading.  Nothing to write home about, but quite tasty!We both had the 2 piece friend chicken (white meat).I had fried okra and greens as sides.Angie had greens and Mac-n-cheese.The chicken was spectacular!  Moist, tender, flavorful, and a crispy breading.  The sides were good, but the chicken absolutely stole the show!The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was darling!  We are excited to be back soon!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tracey H.,"OH, OH",9/8/2022,5.0,Good food! Great place to eat dinner out with family and or friends. Ate here on vacation and it was a great choice outside then norm.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Marissa M.,"San Diego, CA",3/26/2022,5.0,"Amy was just as sweet and can be! Great recommendations on food, everything was so good and I can say I left Knoxville on a wonderful note. Thanks for yummy Southern hospitality:)"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Peggy D.,"Lancaster, CA",8/31/2022,5.0,"Excellent chicken. Baked beans and coleslaw were delicious. We were a group of six, and ordered everything on the menu. Fast service and awesome food."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Eric C.,"Fairfax, VA",2/18/2022,5.0,What a great welcome to Tennessee Gus' chicken is top notch in terms of flavor and juciness.At the first bite you get crispy skin with tender and juicy chicken. The batter has such a satisfying crunch that can't be beat and leaves you wanting more. The sides were great too. Beans are homemade and flavorful. The only gripe was that the Mac was a little cold but still tasted good.Lastly the pie was absolutely delicious. Warm homemade pie with ice cream was the perfect end.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Justin S.,"Signal Mountain, TN",6/1/2022,5.0,"Quite possibly the best fried chicken anywhere.  It has a light breading and the perfect amount of spice.  Both the white and dark meat is juicy and served hot.  I did not really pay attention to the sides because the chicken was so good.  The bone-in chicken is better than the tenders.  Also, my son really liked his pie after the meal."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Joan B.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",1/23/2022,5.0,"Yum and yum. Chicken is well seasoned and fried to where the skin stays on the chicken making every bite crunchy. I was impressed. Oh..  the Mac and cheese, I couldn't stop eating it. Everyone was so welcoming and wanted us to dine in. We took our meal to go, A 2 hr drive.Well worth the stop. Keep it up Gus"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Christina L.,"Boston, MA",5/13/2022,5.0,Amazing. We stopped here for lunch on our way to Asheville. Best fried chicken I've ever had. Fried okra was also delicious. Greens and Mac and cheese were tasty (although I've had better). Service and speed were impeccable and my husband loved the pecan pie. 10/10 recommend. Very glad I don't live close by...dangerous.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Bill W.,"Loudon, TN",6/18/2021,5.0,"""They Do The Cluck Right!"" Wow if your never had chicken done right then you've never been to Gus's.What to order .............Well go on a limb and order the chicken. Off the hook and better than your Grandma's chicken.Plan accordingly as we showed around lunch time and found the place packed. Packed place equals something being done right. I've been to Gus's in Memphis and found Knoxville to be equally as good.Bottom line your not going wrong to try Gus's."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Expected C.,"Brown Deer, WI",8/30/2022,4.0,Breading is flavorful with a spicy kick. Chicken is a bit overcooked but still good. Sides are forgettable.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Josh C.,"Olympia, WA",7/23/2022,1.0,"Food was good but the waitress was an absolute buffoon. Felt entitled to a bigger tip, followed me outside to confront me. Then went back inside to confront my grandma (regarding me). Absolutely unhinged behavior lol. Do not reccomend.Gus needs to pay his workers reasonable rates or get better staff. Aside from this one woman, the rest of the staff were great."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Brian H.,"Lithonia, GA",7/5/2022,1.0,"I travel for a living and have had Gus's chicken in several different cites and this had to be one of if not the worst. I ordered a 3 piece dark (3 thighs) plate with slaw and beans via DoorDash. As usual the slaw and beans were on great but this had to be the driest chicken I've ever had in my life. I get dark meat because it's naturally juicer that white meat, but either they forgot it was in the grease or it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. I've only had (2) bad experiences with Gus's and I apologize for not listing all the good ones, but this experience was horrible!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kristen S.,"Third Lake, IL",11/2/2021,4.0,"I was visiting my son at the University of Tennessee and he suggested Gus's for lunch.  I was game since I had been wanting to try ""hot chicken"".  The chicken was good, not too hot but the kind of heat that slowly builds.  But what I liked best were the fried pickles.  I was a bit hesitant at first since I usually like chips much more than spears.  The waitress convinced me to give them a try saying that they were the best and super crispy.  She was right.  They were the highlight. I will visit again when back in town."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Darrell O.,"Johnson City, TN",7/20/2022,5.0,Beat fried chicken I've ever had.  Sides were great.  Service was absolutely AMAZING!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,w. W.,"TN, TN",6/13/2022,5.0,Haven't been here for awhileThis place has changed! Drive thru service was fast & friendly! Think they changed the fries I don't remember them being this good. Maybe with all the competition on the block they stepped it up - good job!!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Anissa W.,"Raleigh, NC",3/21/2021,3.0,"We visited this place on 3/20/21 for the first time. We have never been to TN before and were visiting the area for a basketball tournament. I used Yelp because we were in the mood for some good chicken/chicken liver. First, we went to Burger Boys, but they were closed. So, we went across town to this place. The service was good. They were friendly and quick. The food was hot and fresh, BUT the friend chicken was a bit too spicy for my friend. I guess that's how they like it in TN, but he said it was too spicy to truly enjoy. I didn't have an issue with it personally, but my beans were not very tasty. They tasted like Bush's baked beans with a bunch of ketchup in it. It wasn't good in my opinion. Also, the drink tops didn't fit, so our drinks were spilling everywhere. The sweet potato pie was cold but good. I wish that we could've tried the first restaurant we went to because they had more of a selection to choose from. AllIn all, this place was ok."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Mike W.,"Murrieta, CA",7/8/2022,4.0,"Really good service and tasty chicken. Since it's so well known, it can get busy. Sides dishes are okay, but the chicken, of course, is where it's at! Super crispy and worth the trip. They serve some of the best sweet tea you'll ever have...ahhh, the nectar of the South ;)"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ginger L.,"Charleston, SC",2/26/2022,5.0,"My colleagues and I stopped in for lunch during a recent volunteer day event at Young Williams Animal Center. The food and the service were exceptional!  We tried the hush puppies and fried green tomatoes as appetizers. They were so good. My lunch was 3 big chicken tenders, Mac n Cheese and baked beans. Everything was top notch. Our server was the fabulous Ms Amy. She took great care of us and kept our drinks filled to the top. I can't wait for a return visit. Check this place out if you haven't already. You will be coming back for more."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,lani s.,"El Paso, TX",6/24/2021,5.0,"Though gus' is a chain you can't tell.  They really know how to fry some chicken.  A menu that shows they know what they're good at.  They have just a few things they do really well.  The coating on their chicken was light and crispy and just a hint of spice.   All the great sides each holding their own.  And omg that chess pie! Was so freaking fresh I could've eaten mine and my table mates.   It's a small place, get there early to avoid a wait. Service is basic but good.  And  for the price it's a great deal."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tai I.,"Knoxville, TN",1/27/2022,5.0,"Revisited, and this place really cares about making customers happy. I reviewed a few months back about the undercooked chicken. Contacted by the owner shortly after. Decide to give it another try today. Very friendly service.  Guy in the back with a thermometer to make sure the chicken is cooked. Everything was perfect: service, friendliness, portions, and speed. Thank you.."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tai I.,"Knoxville, TN",9/17/2021,1.0,"Third time, visiting around lunch and chicken under cooked. I remember the first time it opened and was so good. Now they ramp up the heat, burnt outside and raw inside. A place that is all about their chicken need to put a bit more lovin into it. I been holding off on the review thinking it was just every now and then. But third time the charm. No more gus for me, feeling disgusted and still have an after taste of the raw."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Bari H.,"Bellevue, KY",5/27/2022,5.0,Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had!  Service was amazing and we were able to bring my German shepherd great grandson onto the patio with us!  It will be a stop every time I'm in Knoxville!!  So good!!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jennifer W.,"South Dallas, Dallas, TX",8/6/2022,5.0,"Great food, great service!  The tenders were spicier than the bone in chicken. So yummy. Fried okra was perfect."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jimmy W.,"Tampa, FL",12/11/2021,5.0,Food was amazing. Home cooking with a friendly staff.I got a half chicken with collard greens plus some Mac and cheese. I would do it again.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Allen H.,"Sparta, TN",11/7/2021,4.0,"It is a chain, so not thrilled about that, but it does a good job trying not to be. The outside even looks a bit dive'ish. Here is what matters... The chicken is solid. Flavorful, very moist and plenty of it. The sides are average but good. Pair it all with one of their beverage offerings, adult or otherwise. I have found that when I have a chicken itch, Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken satiates it."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,JoAnn M.,"Rosenberg, TX",5/26/2022,4.0,"Good food, not as good as Hattie B's in Nashville, but hot and fresh. I loved the coleslaw and baked beans, but my friend didn't. I like sweet; she likes less sweet and more vinegar. My sweet potato pie was good, but not outstanding--I should have asked for it warmed. Another friend got chocolate chess (warmed) and it was yummy. I liked that this was pretty much as fast as a fast food place, but it had table service. Our waiter was young and very nice. He said he was new and in training. He was a terrific waiter. I wanted to hug him, he was so sweet."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Heather J.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",6/9/2022,5.0,"Date I say, best fried chicken from a restaurant? Certainly. Wonderful flavor with a kick at the end. The sides are also SOO good. Don't pass up on the baked beans, fried okra, and DEFINITELY don't miss the Mac n cheese."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ben W.,"Knoxville, TN",10/28/2020,4.0,"Super casual chicken joint. The service was really great. I ordered the 2 piece meal with a chicken breast and wing. Both the breast and wing were moist and crispy with a touch of spice. Some of the best fried chicken I've had.The meal also came with two side items. I had the French and the beans, but neither of those were up to the level of the chicken. The person at the table next to me had Mac and cheese which looked really good, so I'll give it a try next time."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ken A.,"Zelienople, PA",10/3/2021,5.0,"Excellent chicken and sides. The Chess pie is a must. Only thing better than the food was the service. Even better than folks say.Portions are not massive, so order accordingly."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Porter A.,"Knoxville, TN",10/28/2021,5.0,Fried Chicken and Comfort food at its finest ina relaxed atmosphere that is as fun as the food is good.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Erik R.,"West Yellowstone, MT",1/23/2022,5.0,I have been going to Gus's since it opened. They have the World Famous and Ultimately Delicious Fried Chicken.

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tony P.,"Washington, TN",3/5/2022,5.0,"Love this place. Just wish it was closer to home so we could visit more often. My wife and I have visited three times. Each time they were very busy but the service was prompt and the food was exceptional. Without a doubt the most flavorful, most consistent fried chicken I've gotten from a restaurant. The sides were great as well. Highly recommend!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Natalee H.,"Gainesville, FL",5/2/2022,5.0,"Fried chicken was delicious with light breading, very crispy and not not greasy. The restaurant was packed but easy to seat ourselves during lunch time. Ordered a drink and got a free suvonyier cup. Sides recommended were coleslaw and baked beans, both of which were good. Server and wait staff were all very friendly and efficient."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Marianne O.,"Knoxville, TN",1/27/2022,5.0,"Great food, great staff! The only problem is they cook with peanut oil and one in my family has to miss out due to a peanut allergy."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Marcus W.,"Enid, OK",4/16/2022,5.0,"We absolutely LOVE Gus's!  We drive from Morristown, TN (which is 40 miles one way) at least once a week to eat their fried chicken.  The staff is very friendly and always makes sure you are taken care of.  I get the chicken tenders, fried okra and beans while my wife gets the dark pieces, okra and slaw.  I wish we had one in Morristown."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Shantel M.,"New York, NY",7/14/2021,5.0,Yummy yummy chicken.   Spicy-- even the kid's meal chicken tenders were spicy.   Chicken was moist and crunchy.  I'd go back and highly recommend this joint.  Mac and cheese side was ok but collards were well done.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Conner W.,"Temecula, CA",1/3/2022,5.0,"All their chicken had come out delicious. I love their chicken strips, Mac and cheese and potato salad."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Sigrit S.,"Wichita, KS",6/1/2021,5.0,"Love the laid back bustling atmosphere. You can talk as loud as you want.  Great sides, best collard greens I've tasted. I'd get the Mac and cheese again. Baked beans are solid too. Chocolate chess pie tastes like brownies. Yum."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Reema P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12/4/2020,5.0,This place is amazing! Got here one afternoon when it opened the fried chicken is full of so much flavor!!! I seriously can't wait until the next time I am back! The fries were also really goood and they kept our drinks refilled and gave us a ton of sauces to eat with.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,John C.,"FL, FL",6/11/2022,5.0,Amazing service. Treated my wife and I like family. Chicken was fantastic and all the sides were delicious. 10/10 highly recommend. Will be back again.

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Katie Z.,"Naples, FL",9/4/2020,4.0,"This was our first stop after landing in Knoxville, TN. It is worth a stop for lunch! Chicken was crispy and juicy and tender on the inside. Mac and cheese was extra cheesy and the slaw was pretty good. Free plastic cups when ordering a drink. It was nice to take it to go. The only thing I wished for was a toasted bread with some butter but the slices bread it comes with is not toasted and no butter with it. The service was good and had that southern charm! It is worth a stop if you're in town!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jewell M.,"Knoxville, TN",4/15/2021,5.0,Best fried chicken (and fried pickles) in Knoxville!! Amy is an awesome manager and has kept us coming back for years now!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Matt J.,"Pensacola, FL",9/5/2021,5.0,"I'm not sure if it's truly world famous but it damn well should be!  Truly delicious fried chicken, I had a breast and wing and my wife had tenders, killer sides and the best sweet tea I've had in a long time.  We took some leftovers home because the portions were large and it was just as good the next day.  Really enjoyed our meal at Gus's, had great service and we will absolutely be back next time we are in Knoxville!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jeff B.,"Raleigh, NC",8/24/2019,5.0,"My first experience with Gus's was years ago at the downtown location in Memphis, TN. It has become one of my all time favorite fried chicken restaurants. The Knoxville location did not disappoint. The place had the southern joint vibe like you would expect from a good Gus's restaurant. It was very clean and the staff was excellent.We had 3 newcomers to Gus's in our party of 5. I had hyped them all about the fried chicken. Gus's exceeded the hype during our visit. Everything was great! The spice in the chicken was perfect. The sides were good with the fried okra and cold slaw being the favorites overall.If fried chicken is your thing then Gus's will make you sing! I strongly recommend this Gus's Fried Chicken."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Lina S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",10/28/2019,5.0,"Hands down, this is some of the best fried chicken I have ever had!!  I have been to Gus's at least 6 times and when I drove to Virginia on Sunday, I knew where I was stopping off for a meal!!Not too far from the UT campus, Gus's is a college student favourite.  It doesn't look like much on the exterior, but inside is some serious cooking!!  They do one thing and they do it well - fried chicken!!I like to get the half chicken plate which comes with two sides.  This time I chose baked beans and potato salad.  The chicken is served piping hot fresh always.  It has a bit of kick of cayenne to it, but the taste is out of this world great!!  The meat is fall off the bone and moist.Baked beans are a good pick and have a sweet bbq essence.  Nice compliment to the chicken's mild spiciness.  The potato salad is definitely made in house - nice chunks of potato with relish and mayo.  Plus, the iced tea is very good!  No watered down stuff here!!They have pie...  Oh my goodness, they have pie!  The pecan pie was a must for me.  They will ask you if you want it warmed and ala mode.  I like it warmed.  It is so perfectly gooey and full of pecans through and through.  That's MY definition of pecan pie for sure!!The vibe is fun with oldies playing (especially 70's R&B)!  They have TV's for sport viewing pleasure, too!  Best of all, the staff is friendly and fun!  They make you feel welcomed and sing with the music as they provide you excellent service!!  Love, love, love coming here!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Max K.,"SoHo, Manhattan, NY",8/21/2020,5.0,"By far the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life. Cooked to perfection with a nice crunchy skin. The dessert was phenomenal too! Definitely get the Sweet Potato Pie if you're stuck. Rachael was amazing! Very sweet, courteous, and hospitable. I would return just to have her take care of me again. 10/10 would recommend!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ruth J.,"Knoxville, TN",3/6/2021,5.0,"Open for business! This charming eatery is tucked in behind the hills of Knoxville on an obscure corner but don't be surprised when you enter this homespun restaurant. The warm welcome will grab your heart. The attentive service is excellent and the food... OMG! The COVID protocols are in place and it's clear the place is clean and sanitized. The food is so delicious. You want chicken? This is moist, tender, delicious fried chicken with just the right amount of spice to take it to the next level and it's clearly made with TLC. The coleslaw is the best I've ever tasted. We love the food so much we order it for delivery and the tastes are consistent. I highly recommend Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken. I'm glad we found this place."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kyleigh W.,"Downtown, Austin, TX",11/2/2020,5.0,This place was incredible. Best fried chicken I have ever eaten in my entire life. But what was even better was the Mac and cheese - it was deliciously creamy and the noodles were obviously made with care. Goodness I would go back everyday for that Mac and Cheese. You MUST also try the sweet tea. THIS IS AS SOUTHERN AS IT GETS. 10/10 would recommend!!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Katherine W.,"New York, NY",6/6/2021,5.0,Pretty good fried chicken and all the sides were great. It's not fancy but all the food was cooked perfectly and it came out fast. BEWARE however that their chicken is a bit spicy. We liked it but our young kids had a hard time finishing the chicken pieces so they filled up on Mac n cheese instead. Parking was adequate.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Volodia C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/21/2021,4.0,"Wow!  We have been to Gus's several times.  Chicken has always been good, but, this time, absolutely outstanding!!  Probably the best Fried Chicken I have ever had!!!  SUPER CRISPY AND SUPER JUICY.  Amazing.  Mac & Cheese is usually pretty solid.  Unfortunately, it was very dry tonight.  Service was a bit lacking this evening also.  But, I am already craving the Chicken and ready to go back next week!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,George L.,"Knoxville, TN",3/3/2021,5.0,Love the food the chicken is excellent always fresh and crispy the sides are excellent. Not much I can say outside of great fried chicken Lexington has a lot to offer for fried chicken in Kentucky and this place definitely can compete with the chicken from Kentucky love coming here have good beer options as well.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Mejong A.,"Carmichael, CA",3/29/2021,5.0,"Great fried chicken! Outstanding customer service! We decided to get the 3 piece dark with Mac n cheese, greens, beans and slaw. My husband loved the slaw and beans. Son loved the creamy Mac n cheese. I loved the chicken hot and moist and the seasoning was perfect. We started with fried pickles and okra. The pickles were amazing.Would definitely recommend Gus's when you are in Knoxville!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Emily D.,"Heiskell, TN",11/5/2021,5.0,"I got fried chicken, Mac n cheese, fried okra. Everything was fresh, cooked just so. The chicken was crispy crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and the seasonings to match it. Best restaurant fried chicken I've had by far. The sides I got were exactly on point too, the Mac n cheese was thick and creamy, fried okra had just the right about if crunch for me, so not too hard but not soggy either. Highly recommend if you're looking for some good fried chicken, or really just comfort food at all. I will be trying the desserts on my next run through. Thank you Gus's!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Gyamfua G.,"Indianapolis, IN",3/25/2019,4.0,"Are you driving home from Gatlinburg and get the hankering for some hot chicken but Nashville is much to far off the route home? Well definitely stop in Knoxville for some Gus Hot and Spicy friend chicken. It's not as spicy as the two hot chicken spots in Nashville, however it is seasoned with a bit of a kick. The chicken is crispy and definitely juicy. The sides were well proportioned. The greens are cooked with bacon and can be accompanied with a a side of vinegar. The Mac and cheese is good and creamy. The baked beans were well seasoned and matched well with the Cole slaw. Their sweet tea is to die for.. definitely some southern sweet tea made with real sugar! Service was fast, precise and really nice."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Steven I.,"Chicago, IL",12/15/2020,5.0,Always clutch and consistent. Can't go wrong with the food. Tried the pie and ice cream. Home made pie and wonderful ice cream. If your in Knox this is a must try. Service is always phenomenal as usual. Hard to been the small town fell and good food.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Steven I.,"Chicago, IL",10/22/2020,5.0,"If they served fried chicken in Heaven... It would be Gus's. Enough said, if your in knoxville you have to check out Gus's. I ordered the 2 Piece pate with slaw and beans. Everything was good. No complaints. The fried green tomatoes are perfect. The chicken is so crispy and juicy. Will return."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Steven I.,"Chicago, IL",9/14/2020,5.0,I'm a chicken Snob and this is the best fried chicken I have ever had. My mouth is watering just thinking about the food. The place was packed and the service is great. I'm going back as soon as I can. You will not be disappointed. I don't hand out 5 stars to just anywhere.

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tonya K.,"Ooltewah, TN",10/5/2020,4.0,On our visit they had outdoor seating for tailgating. The servers were very attentive and food came out quickly. The chicken had a nice flavor. The sides were ok. My potato salad had a sweet taste that was too much for my liking.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Angie H.,"Knoxville, TN",1/18/2020,4.0,The inside isn't much but the service and food more than made up for decor.  I did feel it was a little pricey but not enough to not go back. The chicken was tasty and all of the sides we tried were good.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Susan S.,"Oak Ridge, TN",12/16/2021,5.0,It was the best spicy chicken I have ever eaten. Service was awesome. Besides we're all homemade and tasted excellent.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,JemuelnleAnne M.,"Santa Fe, NM",12/26/2019,3.0,Staff was amazing.   Wings were ok!  It was priced average.  I'd recommend the strips rather than wings.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Taylor W.,"TN, TN",1/23/2022,5.0,Chicken is spectacular. Some of the best chicken I've had. It's always a treat to go in. The Mac N Cheese is also on a totally different level of goodness. Don't get me started on Kim. She's a very entertaining server. She's so energetic and she's always on her toes. I'd definitely recommend coming to this place if you haven't!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Wyatt B.,"Knoxville, TN",1/3/2020,4.0,"Gus's serves some pretty delicious chicken. A friend and I ate here for lunch and definitely recommend giving it a try. The service was extremely fast and friendly. I had legs and tenders. The legs were absolutely delectable. Spicy and perfectly cooked for my taste. Will definitely be coming back for more fried chicken legs. The tenders were good but, they weren't amazing... good flavor but, a little one note. All the sides were very tasty. I recommend trying the potato salad. It's definitely not what you'd get at a chain deli. It has a unique homemade taste and texture to it. Overall, definitely a great place I'll eating at again!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Marlaina W.,"Jonesborough, TN",7/17/2020,5.0,"Stop scrolling, and just eat here. Omg. What a beautiful and wholesome experience. The chicken was so tender, juicy, and the skin was perfectly crisp. The sweet tea was so refreshing. Fried okra and baked beans were bomb. Service was fantastic. Everything was clean and sanitized. Masks are required to enter, which is totally fine. But back to that chicken...goddamn. The BEST chicken I've ever had. Has a little kick to it, but it was quite bearable. It was great with their ranch, but just as fabulous without. I saw where they used to offer catfish, so I'm hoping they'll start doing so again soon. I'll gladly drive the 2hrs to get another taste of heaven. Already planning our next visit."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Meagan H.,"Hendersonville, NC",10/8/2019,4.0,"Oops! I posted my original review to the wrong chicken place!! (Sorry owner!) We stopped in here on the way BACK home from Chattanooga for lunch. We were looking for hot chicken but weren't successful. We were the third people in and were greeted upon entering the establishment by the lady's behind the counter and told to sit wherever we wanted. They have a small menu but it's good, I'm not a fan of restaurants trying to do too much. I got a 2 piece chicken plat, greens and potato salad with a sweet tea. Our server was friendly and a little quirky which was funny. She was thoughtful and asked which pepper vinegar I wanted with my greens. He had tenders, fries and greens. My chicken was good, cooked very well, seasoned well with a little spice and the skin was perfect. The potato salad and greens were good. The sweet tea was southern sweet. He also enjoyed his meal but was a little sad the tenders could not have the same spice on them. It was nice to be able to keep the cup as a souvenir! We got there in good time because the place was full when we were leaving."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Akhilesh R.,"Westlake, OH",6/30/2020,5.0,This one is a real winner. The crunchy hot crust of the perfectly seasoned chicken fry can be devoured in no time and the craving that starts immediately after makes one start planning for the next visit here. Good dining arrangement. Friendly and courteous staff. Efficient service. Cant go wrong here. Fries were fresh and mac n cheese was cheesy cant go wrong with either.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Salina F.,"Knoxville, TN",10/15/2020,4.0,"I love Gus's fried chicken, and I won't give a bad review because of this one thing. Their flavor is amazing, and the meat is always juicy. But come on... The size of this meat is SAD. You guys gotta be consistent with the size of the meat. I'm not going to pay $8 for less meat."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Nash B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/15/2021,5.0,Incredible fried chicken that is both crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Fantastic sides of slaw and greens. Great place for lunch with a nice outdoor patio.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kirsten M.,"Dandridge, TN",12/5/2021,5.0,"Went in on a busy Sunday afternoon.  Great food and great service.  Cole slaw and beans were great, Mac m cheese is nothing special but still yummy!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Mike K.,"Sunbury, OH",9/5/2019,5.0,"It is not the greatest fried chicken I've ever had but  I can see why it is ""world famous"". The chicken is really good  - everything you would expect from a chicken place in east Tennessee - moist, tender, good breading. Super simple menu. The beans were really good and the cole slaw was delicious. The decor was really cool - kind of a dinner feel. The service was incredible  - spot on with the timing, friendly and fun. I will stop back by because I enjoyed it"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kathryn S.,"Northridge, CA",4/3/2021,5.0,"Our family LOVESSSSS Gus's!  We first had it in Detroit, and were pleasantly surprised when we found another location here!  This location has catfish, and it is DELICIOUS!  All the chicken is well seasoned and juicy!  Don't miss out!  Grab a bite to eat at Gus's ASAP!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Steve R.,"Newark, NJ",4/9/2021,5.0,"On our road trip, we stopped here, and I am freakin glad we did. Our server was so awesome! We loved the chicken, I would venture to say it was the best fried chicken I have had in quite a few years. I am 162 years old so that means a lot. If it doesn't take a lot of heat to make you sweat, the chicken will be hot to you. If not, you will notice a little heat but it's all delicious. The slaw and beans were great. They did NOT taste like Buschs with ketchup added (another reviewer said this). That would be nasty. We also tried the potato salad and mac n cheese. Both great. These guys do fried chicken right, so try it!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Patricia H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/19/2021,2.0,"First time getting food from Gus's for both my friend and I. We ordered carry out at around 4 pm. She ordered the 8 piece chicken only and I ordered the half chicken meal with two sides.  Omg, what a disappointment after hearing great things about this place's chicken. It was if the chicken had been cooked earlier during the day and heated up in an air fryer.  It was very hard and extremely dry.  The restaurant was almost empty which was surprising because I heard it was always very busy.  Was it the time of day? Can't understand why the chicken was so terrible after the great reviews I read about this place."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jasen P.,"Cleveland, TN",1/29/2021,5.0,"We stopped in before a football game.   Food was great, if you like fried chicken you should give them a try.   We didn't win the game but the meal was good."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Caki A.,"Eads, TN",3/18/2021,5.0,"I am hooked on this chicken.  It's seasoned just right and the sides are very good.  Since we couldn't go out on my birthday due to you know what, this is what I asked for and I wasn't disappointed.  Can't wait to have it again!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Dionne F.,"Knoxville, TN",6/19/2018,5.0,"World Famous, Fried CatfishGus'sI had lunch at Gus's restaurant here in Knoxville on March 5, 2018.My server was Melinda; she made sure my order of catfish was hot and fresh.Melinda brought out my order of catfish with mac and cheese within 10 minutes.She asked me, if I wanted to try fried chicken as well.And I said yes, so I had 2 piece white meat breast and wing fried chicken.The fries chicken on white bread was good.But Gus's Fried Catfish, was the best fried fish I ever had.Each Catfish was $3.00 a piece; I wanted to order a dozen to take home."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ryan B.,"Nashville, TN",4/13/2021,5.0,Love this place. Food and Staff is always perfect. Even ordering to go they make sure the timing is perfect so you can get home and it still be fresh.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tom F.,"Odessa, Tampa Bay, FL",3/21/2020,5.0,In town for a meeting and tripped across Gus's and glad we did!We are heard at the height of the Corona virus pandemic and drive up. They were taking phone orders only which was fast and easy. Very friendly understanding folks and the food was delivered before we even got back to the car!!Chicken is YUMMY!  Just the right amount of heat. Coleslaw and beans were great too. Glad we stopped by and helped a local business during the hard times!!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jamall G.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",1/17/2021,4.0,The chicken was the best I ever had. The sides such as ; the collard greens and the macaroni and cheese needs help.  Very bland and does not match the tasty chicken. However The staff  was VERY KIND ! Very  welcoming ! I will return one day.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tomas T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",8/18/2020,5.0,The picture does not do it justice. A must try! The macaroni is full of cheesy goodness.  The chicken tenders are amazingly delicious. Plump and juicy with a little kick at the end. Great chicken! A must try when in Knoxville.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Heidi M.,"Tampa, FL",6/30/2019,5.0,"Driving through Knoxville, had a yearning for some hot fried chicken.  After some Yelp searches and some online suggestions, I settled on Gus's.  The place is a no frills, casual spot where the food is the main attraction.  I had the 2 piece dark (thigh, leg) platter with the potato salad and mac-n-cheese, and a breast to get the full spectrum.  The chicken, was fresh, crispy, juicy, mildly spicy and very flavorful.  The sides were just enough to complete the meal, without feeling overstuffed.  The potato salad had a hint of sweetness, which I'm a huge fan of, and the mac-n-cheese was perfect."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Dheeman C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1/11/2021,5.0,Excellent service and great food. The restaurant practices all social distancing norms and has half the tables closed. Loved the exceptional service
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",7/17/2017,4.0,"This place has been on a list of things to try with the GF for so long, that after a day of mulling over what to eat and what to do for the night we ended up here. Glad we finally got to try out all the rant and rave about Gus's. Let's talk about the inside, small tables, and a very laid back family environment. Sit down, take your table, and someone will come and ask what you want. Menu is already on the table, simplistic menu and basically you have the option of: just chicken, chicken with sides, or chicken and then add sides. That's it.So as usual, I was indecisive. We finally settled on the 8 piece dark and well since the GF wanted the Mac n Cheese, that's what was also included. The prices are comparable to other fried chicken spots. The chicken came out not so greasy at all, lightly breaded, and the insides were juicy. Sauce wise, there's the classic vinegar type of hot sauce (I believe they used Louisiana's) and also if you ask for something else that is usually served, they would probably have it. The Mac n Cheese was okay. It wasn't bad, but wasn't amazing that was unforgettable. The chicken definitely was a winner.Now, would I go back? Yep. But, is it something that I absolutely crave? Probably not. All said, this place is definitely a place to check out if you're a fried chicken lover and you're tired of going to your usual fast food joints. This is a different experience, a more sit down experience that you can wait for good results from the kitchen.  The wait might be a little longer than what you're used to, but the juices and crunch from the skin will make it worth."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Katie T.,"Middletown, NY",5/23/2019,5.0,"I am from New York, and I had a group of friends who drive to Texas yearly literally never stop talking about this place. Every time we ate chicken, they'd always say ""It's not as good as Gus'"" with a sigh. So when we were driving through Knoxville, and saw one there, we knew we had to stop.That being said, I cannot express how good this chicken was. Everything about it - from the side dishes, to the sweet tea, to the service we received - was honestly amazing. The chicken was so juicy and soft and fall off the bone. I was hoping it wouldn't live up to expectations because my friends would literally annoy me with it, but holy moly it was so good. If you're from out of town or up north and you're looking for great southern fried chicken and hospitality, you should make the stop here. Now I'm going to be one of the friends raving about this place! It was so good!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/25/2017,4.0,Decided to stop by during my cardio study walks. Food is prepared fresh to order so expect to wait a while. I ordered a thigh and a catfish. They were both so perfectly deep fried and moist. I ate both without sauce and loved it! I didn't know chicken could be this moist and flavorful. Not sure what the average price for chicken is but this was worth it. I enjoyed the fish more - probably because meat is still eh to me. The staff was so friendly! We were talking about my tattoos as I waited for my order. They even refilled my water bottle!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Rebecca L.,"Harrison, TN",4/6/2021,3.0,"I would have given more stars but no where on the DoorDash site did it say HOT/Spicy Chicken! I don't like hot! That being said... chicken is nice and crunchy and flavorful! Had okra, fries and a side of fried green tomatoes.. all good. If you like spicy chicken.. you will like this place"

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Norm O.,"Indianapolis, IN",3/26/2019,4.0,"The chicken was surprisingly tender and moist, with the restaurant was full of patrons. There is a light breading which makes it, for me, not hiding the chicken by covering it up and greasy..I was looking for a bit more ""heat"" from the spices, but it is a mild spice and tasted good.. Even a day old, it is good not to have that greasy taste.."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,G C.,"Maryville, TN",6/9/2021,5.0,"Wife and I ate at Gus's on Sutherland Avenue today. Wife had a chicken breast with a leg & greens, I had the three piece dark with Mac & cheese & greens. Awesomeness on a paper plate. OMG, food and service was 5 stars."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,E V.,"San Mateo, CA",5/16/2019,5.0,"The women working at the counter greeted every patron as 'honey' and treated everyone like they were long time friends. We were a bit over ambitious by choosing the 3 piece plates! Gus' was not skimpy on the size of the chicken they gave to us. The chicken was crispy, juicy and tender. (My mouth is watering just thinking about it.) The spicy level was just hot enough to make you wanting more."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Rob G.,"Buchanan, NY",9/20/2019,5.0,This might be the very best fried chicken I have ever eaten! Everything is fresh and home made . The chicken was delicious seasoned to perfection it has a little kick to it but it's perfect! The Service is friendly the place has such a southern charm and great atmosphere! I can't wait to come back here
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Cassi M.,"Knoxville, TN",11/24/2018,4.0,"Came with a friend for lunch, so upset I forgot to take pics of food :-( because I was hangry and just wanted to eat that day.  This was my first time and I have to say I really liked the chicken.  They had a special of 5 wings instead of 3 with 2 sides and a drink that day, so I got that.  I love my wings and I'm picky, but they definitely nailed them.  They were a good size, perfectly seasoned, just the right amount of heat, and nice and crispy.  I got the beans and collard greens as my sides and a medium order of the fried okra.  The baked beans and greens were ok, could of used some more seasonings for me.  The okra was delicious.   I also tried my friends mac and cheese and it was nice and creamy and ok as well.  I can definitely see coming back for the wings, okra and their sweet tea which was good as well."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Amanda S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",5/5/2017,5.0,"I feel like this place doesn't even need a review! I craved fried chicken during my whole pregnancy so I have tried to stay away since I want to have my body back again. HahaBut hot damn!!!! Legit! Hot chicken dannng! I don't know if this is how all ""hot chicken"" is, but I'm sold! It was moist and so crispy! Packed full of flavor and did I mention moist and crispy!? Our server was super nice and very assertive. He had a very large section so to me that means he is a boss at his job. It being Cinco and having a small one... we kept it chill and enjoyed coronas and chicken with a side of mac n cheese with slaw! Got a little fried okra. Mmmm! GOOD! Had so much food we needed a box/ bag Togo! Learned something new. Paper bag keeps your chicken crispy! Remember that!!! Yum! Speaking of. I'm going to go eat some more now! HahaCheck out Gus's!!!! You will not be disappointed...and if you are it because you have had better hot chicken! :D"

The food was pretty good but I must admit that I was disappointed. I had the chicken tenders which I wouldn't say were spicy. They weren't breaded (or didn't seem to be) and so were dry after the fryer. I'd like to try Gus's again for their bone-in chicken. The sides were tasty but not something that I'd go back for unless the chicken is better next time"

I stopped in for a late afternoon lunch and had a great meal at a great price. Two pieces of dark meat and a side of some of the best greens I've had in a long time!The meat was hot, spicy, and extremely juicy. I didn't see anything on the menu about degrees of heat and I was never asked about it so I presume that their version of hot or spicy chicken is take it or leave it, and I would take it any day.The service was very good, I was helped immediately and I was checked often to make sure everything was OK. And it was.If I have any quibble whatsoever, it's that their lunch plate comes with beans and slaw, my two least favorite sides, and they charge for substitutions, but they also had a snack plate and the sides are reasonably priced so all that meant to me was that I had one side instead of two.Delicious, and great service!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Christopher T.,"Birmingham, AL",2/17/2019,5.0,"I was here on a business trip and a friend brought me here.  It was such a great place.  The menu is simple and items they do best.  We ended up going there 3 times during our trip.  They are a busy place at lunch!  The chicken is great and cooked as you order,  no warming lights or pre-cooked items.  So that means the chicken is hot, crisp and fresh.  The spice is nice and The meals are filing as well!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Paisley T.,"Seattle, WA",10/25/2016,4.0,"If we are judging just on chicken here then this place is 4 stars! The chicken here is legit. It's not just fried chicken and it's not quite hot chicken. But man, it's fried perfectly. This is my first stop if I want me some chicken. Save room for dessert because the chocolate chess pie is so good. You can even order it warmed up with some ice cream. Aaaaaand the good stops there. Ugh. The sides are such a joke. Who is seriously going to pay more than $2 for ounces of cole slaw that you could easily get from the deli or make at home for much less?? The fried okra was so smooshy and gooshy and squishy. Where's the crunch? And the macaroni and cheese had no flavor. If I see any more shredded cheese tossed on top of my mac I'm going on strike. I don't do rookie cheesey, Gus' can do better than that."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Sinh N.,"Plano, TX",6/26/2021,4.0,"Got fried 8 pieces chickens and love it, crispy and juicy, even the breast. Batter is light. One of the best chicken I ever have."

The potato salad, the Mac & Cheese, the sweet potato pie.....bland. I'll give some credit to the chicken. It was cooked really well. Very juicy, tender & crunchy but that seasoning wasn't it."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Yvonne H.,"Lacey, WA",12/28/2019,5.0,"You love fried chicken?  You'll love Gus's.  My hubs and i were traveling through Knoxville around dinner time.  We live in Washington and wanted some southern food.  Fried chicken, fried okra, Mac n cheese.  This place had it all.  We didn't realize when decided to eat here that it was a chain restaurant.  It had a hometown feel inside and our server Amy was outstanding.  Very friendly and generous. Our appetizer hush puppies were a tad undercooked.  She noticed right away and immediately took them back to have a new batch fried up for us.  Our order was up and ready to eat before the hush puppies were done.  I ordered the 2 piece leg and thigh and my hubs ordered the three piece leg and thigh.  I ordered a side of fried okra and the hubs a side of Mac n cheese.  The meal came with delicious Cole slaw and baked beans. I'm not huge bean fan but my hubs gobbled his right up.  But I LOVED my Cole slaw.  It also helped cool my mouth cuz the chicken a a mild kick to it. My fried okra was deep fried perfectly and wasn't mushy.  The chicken was so juicy and delicious, I couldn't stop eating it.  We thoroughly enjoyed the dinner.  Bonus, Amy found out we are traveling through and hadn't ever heard of Gus's so she gave us a souvenir cup so that we could reference other locations through our travels.  She even gave us a complimentary piece of pie and 10% discount because of the hush puppy misstep. We are definitely glad we stopped and enjoyed some southern fare with Amy as our server, extra enjoyable.  She was so friendly and helpful."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kevin-Douglas O.,"Baltimore, MD",7/30/2021,5.0,"Let me start by saying OMG WTF do they put illegal substances in that food? It's crack.  I had greens okra and 2 pc dark and expected it to be good, but instead after one bite I entered into a maniacal frenzy.  I was moaning and slurping... u get the idea.  I'm glad i was with my sister who's used to my eating habits and not on a first date!   This is the BEST chicken I've ever had.  The greens were amazing and the okra was done perfectly.    I finished eating in a sweat.   I took my hat off reclined my chair and smiled.  It's. That. Good."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Douglas P.,"New Market, TN",12/24/2018,4.0,Gus's Chicken is good. The dinners come with two side and if you want something besides the standard it is a $.50 increase for each which for me that's a dollar extra each meal.  So lately I have been ordering the snack (chicken and bread only) and then add a side I would like.  Seems more economical to me. Chicken is always stove hot (burn you tongue type of heat) and just a little spicy hot.   Your choice of white or dark and how many pieces.   Catfish is a good choice.  I have been there with people who got the tenders but did not get an opinion   I am a bone in type of chicken eater.  Overall a good place.  Friendly wait staff. Building is loud due to hard floor and metal ceilings.  But overall good choice.  Different from other chains
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Vivienne R.,"Knoxville, TN",6/15/2021,5.0,The food is always good I usually order the catfish which is not on the menu. Each Gus's restaurant has its own specialty and Knoxville's is catfish! It is delicious!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Doug H.,"Islamorada, FL",6/8/2021,5.0,"Damn good chicken, best I have had in the area and the side fixins are excellent too."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kelly C.,"Baldwinsville, NY",7/7/2019,4.0,"We stopped in here for a quick bite as I was hoping to get some hot chicken in Nashville but missed out, so we decided to get Knoxville Hot and spicy. We ordered the 8 piece dark and 2 sides (mac/cheese and potato salad) and 1 drink, it came to 26.98. The chicken was very juicy and flavorful. It has a bit of kick to it but not unbearable. The sides were good as well. It's a typical diner vibe with tables and chairs. Do stop here if you are looking for tasty chicken."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Sam P.,"KIMBERLIN HGT, TN",9/1/2020,5.0,"Seriously love this place. The chocolate pie is delicious, the okras is delicious and the chicken has just enough spice to curl your toes ! Delivery is always hot and fresh and quick as well!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Natalie E.,"Knoxville, TN",3/29/2018,5.0,"I had a coworker tell me they were meh about Gus's, but I love it. It's crispy chicken, with a little bit of spice. My dad loved the Catfish! It's sides are always delicious, from Cole Slaw to Mac & Cheese and friend Okra! Mmmm! The baked beans are fine, but nothing special. And I've had a few friends who say the greens are great. The restaurant is clean, and even when it's packed there's never much of a wait. They turn over tables quick!They have beer and pie if you need it. (I wish they had some better pie options, but it saves me from the extra calories!)The staff is always friendly. This is one of my go-to places for lunch!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Christian B.,"Fort Myers, FL",11/21/2017,5.0,"World famous is correct! First visit to this location, second visit to a Gus's and every time is fantastic. The atmosphere has a nice southern vibe. The service is friendly and kind. And the food is out of sight! They do one thing and one thing right, spicy fried chicken. But now they will be featuring catfish at this location.  Not sure if they all do it.We ordered the fried chicken, OMG! Super crunchy and it says spicy but the spice hits you quick but does not last long. Coleslaw, great flavor and texture. Mac n cheese, very cheesy and great flavor, greens, tender and flavorful and the new item not on the menu yet is the fried spicy catfish. While for me the pieces were a little small, but they made up for it in flavor. Outstanding! To finish we tried the pecan pie and sweet potatoe pie, both ala mode. They were delicious and a nice end to a great meal. If you have never tried this place before it's a must, be careful it's addicting."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Evie C.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",4/20/2020,5.0,LOVE THIS PLACE!! My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week. He likes the 3 piece dark and I like to get the chicken tenders. The macaroni is literally smashing! I always get extra seasoning on top because why not? Lol Definitely recommend this restaurant. It's a family friendly environment and the owner is so sweet! Don't forget to try their sweet tea if you can handle sweet! Delicious.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tina W.,"Buffalo, NY",5/22/2018,5.0,"What can we say about Gus's, every chicken must have fallen from heaven into an angel's fryer because it is all heavenly. So crisp and juicy and tender with just enough spice to remind you that you are alive. I can't speak for everyone but the greens are angel kisses that you eat. And don't forget to leave room for dessert...that Chess Pie son! (Remember to get it warm with ice cream because why not!)The only down side is that it's an 11 hour drive for us to enjoy this little slice of heaven. (So worth it though!)"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kate M.,"Seaford, NY",7/17/2018,4.0,"I was driving to Nashville this weekend when all of a sudden I was struck with a craving for fried chicken (weird, right?) I perused through Yelp and found myself on the way to Gus's.I was treated with such hospitality as soon as I walked through the door - very kind staff who could tell I was from out of town and needed help.The food was great! (I normally do not like hot, spicy fried chicken which burns your mouth and ruins the flavors for the rest of the meal.) I was worried at first, as most southern joints have chicken with a strong kick to it. Gus's chicken has a mild level of spice and was very tolerable for me, with just the right amount of heat and crunch.  The coleslaw was hands down the best I've ever had at any BBQ joint. The slaw combined with the sweetness of the baked beans toned down the spice on the chicken which really made it that much more enjoyable. The Mac and cheese was kind of one note and didn't have too much flavor, which was the only downside. Did I mention the Pecan pie? What's a trip to the south without a slice of pie!? Which by the way, was the perfect level of crunchy and sweet, a great way to end my meal.I'm certainly glad I stopped in on my trip and would recommend Gus's to anyone traveling from out of town."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Katie K.,"Las Vegas, NV",7/13/2018,5.0,"We were spending the night in Knoxville and wanted a place to go for dinner that we couldn't have at home. We got there about an hour before they closed but they were very welcoming.  The atmosphere is casual.We started with the fried green tomatoes which were delicious.  I had the chicken, my husband had the cat fish and our kids had grilled cheese. There was almost nothing left when we were done.  The chess and pecan pie were awesome, too.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Paula B.,"Louisville, KY",6/19/2020,5.0,"They made my order very fast. The chicken is amazing, has a little bit of a hot kick to it but nothing crazy. Good Mac n cheese. The potato salad had a fun surprise of some sort of cinnamon-type flavor. Definitely stop here if you want good soul food."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Mike P.,"Knoxville, TN",5/8/2021,5.0,"The people here are incredibly nice and the food is good. They have really become a neighborhood fixture over the years. Seriously, you won't find nicer people."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Marie L.,"Marietta, GA",8/7/2020,4.0,Yummm! We love Gus's fried chicken..especially the tenders. They have just the right amount of spice and are both crispy and moist. The fries are really good too.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jill H.,"Lake Forest, CA",6/23/2019,5.0,"This is how fried chicken is supposed to taste like. And the sides were amazing too. Not to mention the server, Kim, was awesome. All around a great experience. We will absolutely be coming back. P.S. ask for the hush puppies, not listed on the menu but they're soooo good."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,April N.,"Oak Ridge, TN",6/26/2019,4.0,"Almost as good as home! Crispy tasty hot chicken yum!

I've  been to the one's in Los Angeles, Burbank and Memphis. All were delish, Fresh, hot, employees were great.  We were on our way to Tennessee saw how close we were knew we needed to stop off for some Gus's. Keep up the great work."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kim T.,"Knoxville, TN",10/23/2020,5.0,Best chicken in town (a little spicy to some) and the greens and Mac and cheese are delicious. Their sweet potato pie is great too.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Deann D.,"Knoxville, TN",10/22/2020,5.0,Oh my goodness I don't know why it took us so long to try Gus's. Their chicken is DELICIOUS!! I can't even put into words how flavorful and juicy Gus's chicken is. The sides are a different story. My husband had baked beans and slaw. I had fries and Mac-n-cheese. The sides aren't bad but they definitely aren't at the same level as the chicken.  The chicken was so good I'm already wondering when I can talk my hubby into ordering it again.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Andrea D.,"Hialeah, FL",11/23/2019,4.0,"The most delicious fried chicken in Knoxville! Since planning our trip to Knoxville the only thing my husband has wanted to do was come and eat here. It did not disappoint. It was very very good fried chicken. I had dark meat with Cole slaw and baked beans. The chicken was hot hot hot and a little spicy. The sides were just ok. I expected them to be a little bit better but you come here for the chicken, not the sides. My husband had the tenders with fries. They were hot and juicy and just the way he likes them. We would definitely go back if we are in the area again."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ron G.,"Farragut, TN",9/11/2020,5.0,"What a gem! If you have not tried this place, put it on your short list to do so. Great fried chicken, excellent sides, homey interior, and a great staff and owner. Not to be missed!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Devashis R.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/26/2017,3.0,"I don't want to give Gus' three stars, and I hope to return so it can be amended. Unfortunately it was just ok. Came on Solar Eclipse Day, so perhaps everyone was feeling the effects of less gravity or maybe the best cooks took the day off to see the amazing spectacle.Let's start with the good. A clean, well-kept establishment with a very courteous staff. Service was also quick. They also had an Eclipse Special which consisted of two dark pieces with two sides for a very reasonable price. Fried okra was tasty. All the above was awesome!The fried chicken, however, left a lot to be desired. I felt it was overcooked so the outside of the chicken was wayyy too crispy to the point things were curling (burnt IMO). Maybe the oil was too hot? The interesting thing is, the inside of the chicken was nicely done, so I'm not sure what would've caused this. It was hard to appreciate the taste the hot & spicy seasoning because of the exterior being overcooked. I also found the coleslaw to be a bit too mayonnaise-y.It was a bit disappointing but obviously not the end of the world. We were craving the spicy Nashville chicken so were hoping this would satisfy. Maybe it will the next time around, just not sure when that will be.On a final note, please please please stop using Styrofoam. I can't even begin to fathom how much non-recyclable trash all of the locations generate. :-/"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Chad S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/10/2021,5.0,One of My Favorite Chicken Places. Spice is perfect and not overwhelming. Just don't dive into it. Wait a few for it to cool and enjoy.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Van S.,"Orient, OH",4/5/2017,4.0,"In a nutshell, awesome service and really good chicken.I had the 3 piece dark combo.  Their chicken isn't heavily breaded but has an enjoyable fry skin.  It was nice and juicy too.  It would be awesome if they could vary their heat level though.  It wasn't spicy enough for me, but too spicy for the wife and kids (wimps).  Still, I would rate the chicken between a 4 and 5.  The side of coleslaw was maybe a little too creamy for my taste, the baked beans tasted like an ordinary can of beans, and the mac and cheese was pretty solid.  Sides were probably a 3 star on their own."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Nikki B.,"Brunswick, ME",4/11/2019,5.0,"Came to Knoxville to visit my hometown and obviously had to get fried chicken and catfish. There is no better place in Knoxville for fried chicken. We got an order of catfish, fried chicken, fried okra, and for our sides we tried their Mac and cheese and hush puppies. Omg. So. Good. It's a must for anyone who is looking for honest to goodness southern fried chicken."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ariana S.,"Alpharetta, GA",8/7/2019,5.0,"The food was really good. Atmosphere was really friendly and the food came out quick. The chicken skin has a nice kick to eat, and the meat is so juicy! There was a fly bothering us the whole time (not the restaurants fault) - it was probably jealous it couldn't eat the food. Really good prices! Will be coming back :)"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jessica C.,"Paris, France",4/1/2019,5.0,"This is THE BEST fried chicken I have ever had. Period.Okay, back up: I've been on an extended road trip through North America, and I have just spent the last month and half in the American South. Suffice to say, I have eaten a lot of fried chicken while here! And this place is hands down the best.The chicken was unbelievably juicy, just so tender and moist. The batter was satisfyingly crispy and well seasoned. It had a spicy kick to it that elevated the whole experience. I ordered fried okra as a side and it was perfect as well - tender okra with a tasty crunchy breading. The other sides (slaw and baked beans) were a good complement to the meal but nothing outstanding. Then we had dessert! Warmed up chess pie with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream was the perfect ending to an amazing meal.Our server was very friendly and the food came out fast and piping hot.So how good are they? Well they're a chain and we're already looking ahead to see where we can eat at Gus's again! Must try, and then must return for more!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Scott L.,"Buffalo, NY",1/31/2017,5.0,"Visited Guy's on a raining Monday night, totally worth the trip, best fried chicken I haven't had for a while, different than KFC, but is well cooked and a little salt, so many flavor while enjoying the chicken. I had the 5 or 7 piece combo, end up nearly finishing all of these. I will re-visit if come back to town. I ordered the take out, so didn't have many chance enjoy in the store, staff was very friendly though."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Becky B.,"Knoxville, TN",3/11/2019,4.0,"Mmmmmm.... just writing this review is going to make my mouth water. Fired chicken was out of this world, mac and cheese and potato salad not far behind. Sweet tea was the best I have had, and the pecan pie...well let's just say I gained 5 pounds just in one sitting but worth it. Must come! Laid back environment and super fast service!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Johnnie S.,"Lorient, France",9/2/2019,5.0,"My son and I were traveling through Knoxville looking for a different place to eat.  Something local, reasonably priced and family friendly. Spotted Gus's World Famous chicken and decided to give it a try. Not the easiest place to get to from I40 but well worth the drive. Daniel was our server. Friendly and efficient. Good guy.  Restaurant was clean. Food awesome!   You know the chicken is good when you keep picking at the bone looking for meat. Wow!  Very reasonable on the prices. Not much more to say."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Rhetta A.,"Knoxville, TN",3/24/2017,5.0,I love this spot! The chicken is by far the best fried chicken i've ever put in my face!..sides are on point....sometimes parking is hard to find but that just means its like a treasure hunt with soul food as the prize and im the winner winner chicken dinner! You're greeted with smiling faces that make you feel right at home!Make sure to try the fried pickles and save room for the warm chocolate chess pie and a scoop of ice cream! It is life changing!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Bernard M.,"Knoxville, TN",5/14/2019,5.0,"This place knows how to fry some bird! Wow! White or dark meat is all delicious. Perfect crispness, taste is spicy but not over bearing, meat always cooked to perfection. Oh, and ALL of the sides are incredible. If you have room, desserts are ridiculously good. If you've done it right, you'll go right home and have a nice siesta after lunch at Gus's. Great job y'all!"

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Lori W.,"Knoxville, TN",9/25/2016,2.0,"World Famous? I never heard of Gus's but im fixin' to find out- You can sure smell the chicken fryin' when you step out of your car!! Smells yummy- parking lot is full...very busy here on a Sunday evening--we was seated right away. Waiter took our drink order. Got the 3 piece white (2 chicken breast and a wing) sides include slaw and beans and ordered an extra side of macaroni and cheese-It is VERY loud in here cause of the metal ceiling and opened space. They have big screen tv's on each corner of the dining room. So watching football was good- 70's music playing...can barely hear it cause of the talkin', babies screaching...ughh!One of the waitresses here looks like a gal from Jackies Dream restaurant. (Wonder if this is the same restaurant different name hmmm, fixin' to find out)They have shirts, hats and gift cards for sale in here-Well, not off to a great start- people beside us just got what we ordered and they served it to them and we were here before them...ahhh here comes our waiter. Yes, yes, yes he is trying to find our chicken.....I can tell him where it went. It's been 31 minutes, he said it takes 18 minutes for breasts to cook. Ok. Then, where is our food? He is acting really nervous, he knows what he did with our plates.Ahhh, we have to wait yet another 18 minutes.Finally 38 minutes, chicken is here.Was it worth the wait? No. Certainly not. If this chicken took 18 minutes to cook why is It not steaming hot?? It's just warm.It was even not spicy at all. Needs spice! If your name is Gus's World Famous Hot And SPICY Chicken, you should stand behind your product... It was juicy that was it. Had to add hot sauce to it..The Mac n' cheese was good,  the best part of the meal. A lady behind us ordered the Mac n' cheese after she seen mine and a lady came out and said they were ""out"" of it. HOW can a restaurant be out of Mac n' cheese? Unless it's brought in- ahhh yes.Will NOT be back to this establishment-"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Laurel L.,"American Fork, UT",5/15/2020,5.0,"If I had to say everything I feel about this place, we would be here all day. Southern hospitality at its finest! Wonderful people! Best sweet tea ever! Bought a gallon to take home. Fan freaking tastic Tennessee hot chicken. And tenders were just as good as chicken pieces. Mac & cheese was homemade and creamy yumminess. Potato salad was homemade and ok. I will definitely stop every time I pass through Knoxville."

Our food was SO AWESOME!! we love chicken and had never heard of this place. Hands down will always eat this place whenever we are near it! Thank you the wonderful food and customer service!

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Thao T.,"Hendersonville, TN",10/22/2016,5.0,"O m g, awesome chicken. I've never been to the original Gus's in Memphis, but this extension of the Tennessee chain was on top of it. We came in a little past prime lunch time on a Saturday and it was still packed. The exterior of the building is not pretty... lol but when you walk in, it's bustling with movement. A little too much for me so we got to enjoy the patio on a pretty fall day. Sooo.. the chicken. The paprika colored crust was crispy and flavorful. Seasoned well but not overly salty at all, and the best part.. there was little to no oil on the underlying bread!!! I absolutely hate when I'm finishing my chicken and the bread is dripping with grease. This was definitely a pleasant surprise. The crust held in all the juices and when you bite into it, it's literally dripping. Yum. Even the breast was super moist! No, it's not super spicy but there is Louisiana hot sauce sitting on each table if you want a little more heat. It would be super cool if they'd roll out different spice levels. The sides all tasted good too, but the chicken is definitely proving true to being the star here. Each of the plates come with a slice of white bread, beans, and coleslaw. We got a 3 piece dark plate, 2 piece white plate, and subbed mac n cheese for one side on one plate + 2 waters, it came to like $21 before tip!! Fair price for a super filling meal. Also, Percella was so sweet, great service."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,TN C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/11/2019,4.0,Some great tasting fried chicken here. nice & spicy! Loved the crispy chicken skin.  Their chicken strips are really fresh & good! Good portions too
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,E M.,"Kirkland, WA",9/19/2016,5.0,"Excellent Hot chicken! Just the right amount of heat and juicy. Even the breast was juicy and perfectly cooked. The skin was light and crispy. Do yourself a favor and just get the half chicken.Very clean inside, lots of friendly staff and fast. They have three large flat screens making it the perfect place for Monday night football. Get some ranch to balance out that heat."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Amie D.,"Claxton, GA",12/7/2020,5.0,"What a pleasant surprise! Hubby and I stopped here twice this weekend and were extremely pleased. It is very unusual for me to enjoy a ""fast food"" chicken restaurant. Between our meals together, we tried white meat chicken breast, chicken tenders, fries, slaw, greens, and potato salad. All were way better than expected and complimented each other. The only thing we tried that we didn't enjoy was the chess pie and that was probably just a matter of taste. It is very, very sweet. A really good, dress down experience."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Dee O.,"Knoxville, TN",9/1/2016,3.0,"Actually 3.5 stars. I have eaten at Gus's twice now. Yes I ate there two days in a row. Opening day was busy. I got there around 2 to avoid the crowd and still had to wait about 40 minutes for a take out order. Today's wait  was slightly only better, likely because I went there just before the game started. The sides are actually really good (tried the baked beans and the slaw). Enjoyed both of those. The chicken, though hot with a mild kick, was just average. It is possible that they still need to get their feet on the ground, given they have only been open for 2 days. It is also possible my expectations were very very very high. Given the hype. Jackie's Dream still makes the most fantastic chicken I have ever had. Although I would gladly take the sides here at Gus's. I will give it one more shot in the next couple months :)"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Torrance E.,"Saint Francis, WI",9/21/2018,5.0,This chicken is just ridiculously good!! I was in Knoxville when I found out they had a Gus's fried chicken. Although we had dinner plans already. I quickly canceled them to get my hands on some of this delicious chicken.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Emily G.,"Jonesborough, TN",2/16/2020,2.0,"When you get to the place, it looks like a cookie cutter, freshly minted mid level chain on the outside...odd choice for a Southerland location. It looks to be the same building you'll see on Kingston Pike - for example that pizza place across from West Town. Parking is tight. Even though there are a fair amount of spaces, the limited distance between the building and the spaces mean you will likely have to make multiple passes to get into your spot. Once inside, their theme goes in a totally different direction...almost retro, but not quite. Pandering (?) local sports, etc memorabilia on the walls, even though this is a chain. Makes me wonder if other locations are doing the same thing with whatever their nearest team is (most likely). Not sure why restaurants think this is a good idea, but it seems to be very common around Knoxville on anything above fast food up to mid level places. Very noisy inside. fairly low celling with hard floors, walls, etc. No way to really have any conversation when crowded. This was the case when we were there. Super crowded. Single bathroom (x2). Want to wash your hands? Actually use the bathroom? May not happen when it's busy. Line formed the whole time for men or women's side. We were seated at the only table left (next to bathroom hallway) so we were able to watch people's frustration and awkwardness many times over as people would finally get their chance to go in only to have another person try to rip the door open immediately. Skimping on bathrooms seems to be a way new restaurants are cutting corners these days, but let's be realistic - one bad bathroom related incident means a customer will never return. Penny smart is pound foolish, as they say.Ok...the good part? The waitress was nice...and apologized for the noise. Rather than go back and forth trying to make out what was being said, she leaned in and used the ole' cupping hands like a megaphone trick. Smart. Most will just let you ask ""what"" over and over. Food came fairly quickly. Taste was great, at least the chicken. Sides were just that...sides. Knowing what I know now, I'd pass on the ""meal"" and simply order a piece individually and maybe an order of fries. Would have cut the overall cost down considerably to do it that way too. Summary? Excellent chicken. OK sides. Take note as to how you order Facility not really up to big crowds. Try this place at a slow time of day and you will likely find it excellent. Come around dinner time and it will be totally different experience for you. My two would have easily been a three if I were there at a slower time."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Janine A.,"Knoxville, TN",12/30/2019,4.0,"The hot chicken is well, hot. The greens are good and the staff are always helpful and cheery. Served quickly even when its busy."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Diana G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/2/2019,5.0,"2 years later and still as good as the first time! Today was my first time at here. Everything was awesome. We went at 4:30 and it wasn't busy nor slow. As soon as we arrived, staff asked if we are dinning in or take out. When you dine in, you can seat anywhere. The servers are nice and extremely fast. Waitress always checked on us and refilled drinks. The food was awesome. The chicken skin was so crispy! Delicious! Definitely recommend this place!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Diana G.,"Knoxville, TN",10/11/2016,5.0,"Honestly, I heard so much hype about this place and had my doubts. Yesterday we went in around 4:30 on a Tuesday. As we walked in the staff ask if you're dinning in or taken out, then they direct you once you have answered. We dinned-in, we choice our own sitting, at the moment the place was at a normal pace ( not too busy but not too slow). The server came almost immediately and brought drinks out quickly. The menu is small but perfect! I got 2 piece dark meat, baked beans, & fried okra: The chicken skin was crunchy and delicious ! I honeslty would recommends this place to anyone looking for great fried chicken! Great food and great service!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Lucas M.,"Knoxville, TN",12/2/2018,4.0,"Super tasty food, good service, nice beer selection. I'm going to go against the group here. This is NOT Nashville hot chicken. By comparison, this is nothing. With that out of the way, I would surely recommend this place if you are in the area."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,John B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/20/2018,3.0,"This is about the 10th time I've had Gus' chicken and I would say this visit was not the best. Atypical, the chicken was dry tonight. I can't tell you if it's a new guy on the fryers or just a batch that was not looked after. The sides were good.I had the sweet potato pie, which I never order dessert. It was missing some key ingredients. Lacked sugar and cinnamon, crust was really good.I hope this is a single incident as I can't go back to KY fried which is not bone dry but there is about a quart of oil with each fried breast. I hope the chicken was just not looked after on this batch."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jordan L.,"Manassas, VA",3/13/2020,5.0,"Such good chicken, and great service to boot! If you're going through the area, this is a great place to stop by and have dinner."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Miss G.,"Lawrenceville, GA",4/14/2017,5.0,I would say it's one of the best fried chicken I've ever had!! I had 2 whites plates (breast&wing) the breast was very tender and the meat fell off the bone from the wing! very well seasoned and it's lightly breaded.The staff was friendly and helpful too. Definitely will come back when visit Knoxville again :)
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Stephen S.,"Knoxville, TN",8/18/2018,3.0,"If this place didn't have two outstanding competitors in East Knoxville,  they'd be 4 star at least, but they're just not to that level.  The chicken is good but not WOW good... they could really use a spicy option to perk up the slightly bland chicken offering.  Also. I found the sides to not be that awesome.   I'll go here if I'm in the area, but if its fried chicken I must have, then a trip across town is worth the trip.   Sorry Gus'!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Caitlin O.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/21/2019,5.0,"Was a bit bummed to find out there are Gus' all over the US, but felt like we had to stop In Tennessee, the original home of the chain! The chicken was delicious and well priced and service was efficient and friendly. This location has a small patio which was necessary with our pups! I'll be thinking about this fried chicken for a while!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Mina R.,"Deerwood, Jacksonville, FL",8/3/2020,5.0,"We're visiting from Florida and really wanted to have fried chicken while in Knoxville. Gus's fried chicken did not disappoint! We have the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer (they're good but not worth the cost), I had the 3-tender plate (beans and seasoned fries as sides) and my husband had the 3-piece dark meat plate with Mac-n-cheese and beans for sides. Everything was delicious!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Wanda H.,"Albany, GA",1/23/2020,5.0,"I love Gus's. My co-workers and I eat here frequently for lunch. If you like spicy chicken with all of the fixings, then this is your spot. The staff is very friendly, the service is quick, and the food is good. Give 'em a try!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Chris R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2019,5.0,Great chicken great chicken great chicken! The place is always clean the food is very fresh and I have never had a bad experience here. It is what it is a great chicken place The is no BS the staff has always been friendly and efficient even when really busy. The breading can be a little on the spicy side but nothing that makes you uncomfortable!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Mallory L.,"Las Vegas, NV",11/16/2019,5.0,Chicken is always juicy and delicious--sides are equally as delicious. Everything is always hot and fresh. Customer service is top notch.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Andy M.,"Huntsville, AL",10/21/2019,3.0,"Based on my first visit here, I give them three and a half stars.  This experience was a little above average.  My expectations were too high after seeing the reviews on Yelp."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Cindy P.,"Madera, CA",12/30/2019,5.0,"First time for us. Saw great yelp reviews and thought hey let's give it a shot. Food was so good, the chicken was spicy and crispy skin was melt in your mouth good. Service was great, friendly and attentive. We had the pie, ask for it warmed you won't be disappointed."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jim A.,"Crossville, TN",11/3/2020,5.0,"Gus's is a chicken  joint, pure and  simple. The dining area is just a huge room with a lot of tables and a lot of noise.  So what makes Gus's such a huge attraction?  Couple of things.  One, they are Uber friendly at Gus's, you will feel like family and if you don't watch out you will find yourself in friendly conversation with whomever might be seated around you.  Or not.  But that's not the real reason.  It's the Chicken, it's the dad gum jumpin up and  down taste of tender chicken with some wonderful spice for a little kick.  It's tender, always hot from the kitchen and wonderfully tasty.  If you want something other than fried chicken, go somewhere else.  You have two choices: white meat or dark meat.  Oh, and one other thing, they now have fried catfish that is on the spicey side.  They are small filets that do not taste like mud.  Once you go to Gus's for chicken you will be hooked.  Hoo Rah for Gus's chicken"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Phyllis H.,"Marietta, GA",5/31/2018,4.0,"I like this place.  I really do.  But, I don't like the chicken.  It's just a personal preference.  Yes, the chicken was juicy, flavorful but was a little too hot for my taste. I live in Atlanta but I visit my employer often who is based in Knoxville, TN.  I have been doing so for about a year. One thing I can say about Knoxville--I have NEVER had a bad meal. NEVER!  And, that includes this visit.I ordered white meat with mac-n-cheese and baked beans.  Like I said before, I did not like the chicken but that's just me.  I did like the mac-n-cheese and the baked beans and may re-visit just for these two reason.  The mac-n-cheese was not overcooked and had a healthy measurement of cheese in it and on it.  The baked beans were good as  well.  Customer service was good.  Staff was friendly.Yes, I would recommend and return.  4 Stars."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jon M.,"Gallatin, TN",12/21/2017,5.0,Absolutely amazing!!! The best fried chicken and fried catfish we've had...ps the catfish isn't listed on the menu but do yourself a favor and get at least one filet..it was perfect!!!!We had Josh as our waiter and he was great...all the staff are so welcoming and friendly!!! Eat here people!!!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Chico O.,"Knoxville, TN",4/22/2018,5.0,"Perfectly spicy & crunchy chicken! Friendly and professional services! Can't ask for better, looking forward to trying their catfish."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Lynn B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/22/2018,3.0,"My very first visit to Gus's was in Memphis several years ago and it was outstanding. When I heard Gus's was coming to Knoxville I couldn't wait. So for my birthday, I decided it was time. My expectations were set at the original Gus's and they were high. Well, this didn't quite meet those expectations. It was fine but it wasn't as good as I rememberI ordered Fried Green tomatoes (a personal favorite) and fried okra. I ask the waitress if the okra was homemade vs standard restaurant out of bag okra. She said it was just like mom's. It was not. It was the standard out of the bag fried okra. The fried green tomatoes were fine. Nothing special but was ok. I got an order of chicken fingers. When I was in Memphis I got a breast and that may have been the difference. In short the fingers seemed like they were double fried. Again, they were ok but nothing really special and frankly I was disappointed.  The waitress was attentive so no complaints there. Overall, the family ordered various pieces of chicken. No complaints from group but the general feeling was the same for all -- it's not food that will make me go out of my way for. I'm sorry and I hate writing that but it's honest."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Mike N.,"Oxford Hunt, Charlotte, NC",2/9/2020,5.0,Stopped in on the way back to Charlotte from Louisville. The chicken is life changing. Hiighly recommend going out of your way to get some. Skip the standard fast food and make it happen.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Everette P.,"Knoxville, TN",2/8/2020,5.0,"The chicken is on point. Every meal I've had has been hot and fresh. Major props to gus's. The staff is friendly, the food is great, that atmosphere is humble. My favorite part besides the chicken are the sides and the white bread. I honestly couldn't ask anymore then BOOM got the glass of sweet tea and it is southern nectar."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Shelby B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/21/2018,5.0,"Probably one of the best fried chicken spots I've ever had. The chicken was crispy, juicy, with a little kick. Mac and cheese, fried pickles, and coke slaw were just perfect. The staff was AMAZING, on point, and just really awesome."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Cyndi C.,"Orlando, FL",7/4/2017,5.0,"I knew when I saw a hot and spicy in the description of the fried chicken, that this had to start somewhere close to Memphis. The owner explained it's a recipe from Mason, Tennessee. Mason is about 20 miles north of Memphis.The menu is simple and delicious. The breading on the chicken has just the right amount of heat while being light and crusty without being overwhelming. The meat it's self is very fresh and does not taste mass produced.   I had the two piece meal dark with baked beans and fries on the side. The fries have a spicy shake on them as well. The dinner come serve with a slice of white bread which is a nice complement to the heat of the rest of the meal. Catfish is also available but is not on the menu.  My brother-in-law had the catfish in addition which he said was a little spicier than the chicken. The catfish is for the less faint of heart.  The dining room is casual, clean and comfortable. The service was very friendly and accommodating. We felt very welcome, and the food came quickly. There is also outside seating if it is a beautiful East Tennessee day. If you are not a fan of spicy, then I would recommend ordering the mac & cheese and make sure you get some ranch dressing on the side if you order the chicken.I plan on returning and trying the fried pickles next time. The people at the table next to me ordered some and they looked awesome. Enjoy!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Amanda B.,"Kodak, TN",8/4/2018,3.0,I'm a little torn about how I feel. On one hand I like the chicken and I think it's a different/good flavor. On the other hand it's just too inconsistent. Some days I've been very pleased and then days like today I'm disappointed. I got the 8 piece mixed like usual. The breasts were really small and one of the thighs needed cooked longer. I don't live close so I visit the first Saturday of every month when I'm in town. I don't know if I'll be back again but if I do I'll dine in and see if it differs from carryout.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jen G.,"Boca Raton, FL",8/29/2019,5.0,"Every time we visit my parents in Knoxville we always stop in here once or twice during our trip. Maybe I'm getting so used to the rudeness here in Boca so going to a place like this where everyone is so friendly is so refreshing! On top of the very friendly staff the food is outstanding, fresh, juicy and delicious. If you are visiting Knoxville or anywhere close you need to stop in here and have some of the best fried chicken, coleslaw, beans, fries and pies! Just thinking about my last visit Is making my mouth water. Can't wait to go back get some chicken and catch a Vols game"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jessica P.,"Athens, GA",9/23/2020,5.0,"Super fresh, hot, and crispy chicken. Breading has a great spice to it, hotter than regular fried chicken but a bit less than ""Nashville hot chicken"". Good fried okra too! Fast friendly staff. I'll definitely be back!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Merry N.,"Memphis, TN",11/28/2017,5.0,"I'm from Memphis, so when I heard Gus's was opening in knoxville, I was ecstatic!Their food always comes out hot. The chicken is fried and seasoned to perfection. There is really no comparing them to anything else. It's so delicious, every single time. I hope they consider extending their hours just a bit as I work kind of late and sometimes don't have time to catch them for dinner!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,al c.,"Rogers, AR",3/23/2018,4.0,"Stopped in after being on the road for 10hrs.  Staff:  great staff, suggested menu options outside of chicken.  Very attentive to refills. And suggested sides.Food:  catfish was awesome.  Right amount of seasoning and spice.  The breading was nice and crunchy.  HUGE portion.  Chicken was great same amount of spice and moistness.  Order the Cole slaw to cool down the heat.  Nice place will visit other locations."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Una D.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",11/18/2017,4.0,"i happened to be in knoxville and decided to this place out. i love fried chicken and this one was great. i also have a fast food bucket list so i had to try this one outhere is what i gotdrumstick and thigh= delicious! the skin was battered evenly and was very crisp! and yes i ate the skin, even though i should not have, it came with a piece of wonderbread which i always discard, not sure who actually eats that unless theyre a birdbaked beans-goodmac and cheese-goodservicei was charged for 2 sides despite being told that 2 sides came with the meal i ordered, i didnt complain about it since it was less than a dollar, but that is misrepresenting the menu, so hence the star rating going downambianceclean, bare bones, has tv's to watch while you chowparkingplenty, free , in the lotoverall: i would come by again for a quick calorie fest, it was nice to have some great fried chicken after a while"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Evelyn V.,"Columbus, OH",7/27/2019,5.0,"Delicious. The chicken is on point and sides of Mac and cheese, greens, and coleslaw are great. Quintessential southern tastes."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Colton N.,"Downtown, Raleigh, NC",10/29/2020,1.0,Over priced. I literally got 4-5 fries as a side and a tiny scoop of Mac and cheese. The sides were nearly $5 a piece. Not to mention the chicken taste like wal marts deli.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Goalie Mom 0.,"Frisco, TX",3/16/2020,5.0,Absolutely one of the best places to eat fried chicken. Crispy juicy! The Mac N Cheese yum yum. The season fries were crispy and full of flavor. It's worth the stop if ever driving thru Knoxville. The boys loved their chicken tenders. Beans and Coleslaw were the bomb.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jonathan R.,"Las Vegas, NV",9/3/2019,5.0,"Stupid good chicken, with just the right amount of spice that builds up over time. The sides are all amazing as well, one of the few places I'd actually opt for the standard side of beans. That being said, I seldom do as the rest are definitely worth the up charge IMO. Legit, I tried some tenders from here to go, came home and wasn't feeling it. Microwaved them the next day (I was in a hurry, alright), and they tasted as if they hadn't been microwaved at all. Can't say the same for the bone in chicken I'm sure, but it amazes me how well it held up and didn't get soggy at all. Now to just get Gus' Fried Chicken in Las Vegas, so I don't have to resort to mainstream chains like Churches."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Accurize 2.,"West Milton, OH",8/12/2018,5.0,"My wife had Gus's in Fort Worth and raved ever since about how amazing it was. On our return home from vacation we passed through Knoxville TN, and she insisted we have lunch there.I'll make this really brief...This is the type of restaurant that makes you start looking at local real estate listings...it's really THAT good!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Michael B.,"Johnson City, TN",6/20/2019,5.0,"One of the best chicken places I've found in a while. Love the hot crust.  It feels local, had no idea it was a chain.  Can't wait to go back!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Vanessa N.,"Norcross, GA",7/12/2017,4.0,"There is a reason why this is the popular fried chicken spot in town. The skin was not heavily breaded and had a lot of flavor, while the chicken was extremely juicy. The wait for the chicken was a bit long for a chicken specialty place, but it was also a Friday evening."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Sherry L.,"Plymouth, MI",8/10/2019,5.0,Omg the absolute hands down best fried chicken I have ever had.  I loved everything the wings slaw greens and fried okra.  So good. And our waitress was adorable and super friendly .  And the best part... found out there is a Gus's about a mile from my home.. Westland I hope you are as good as Knoxville
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tearsa S.,"Knoxville, TN",6/30/2019,5.0,I LOVE their food. The service is down home and friendly. The hot chicken is so delicious. I recommend getting at least a three piece plate. The sides are good. You can't go wrong.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Erica G.,"Greenwood, IN",6/24/2018,5.0,"First time in Knoxville and first time at Gus's... it was absolutely delicious!  Crispy, juicy, tender and definitely a little spice to it.  The atmosphere and staff were also great!  Music they play is on point... Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding etc just made the experience that much more delightful."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kayla H.,"San Antonio, TX",10/4/2019,5.0,Great fried chicken with a nice spice to the flavor! Also solid southern sides. I got the okra and Mac n cheese. Very reasonably priced.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Victoria H.,"Kingsport, TN",9/19/2017,5.0,Words can't even give this place justice! I had the tenders with potato salad and baked beans. Potato salad is mayo based with red skin potatoes. Mmm. Bake beans were nothing fancy but still good. The chicken....ooooo my gosh the chicken! So the outside is crispy but not breading. Almost like broaster style. It's seasoned perfectly little spicy but not hot. The inside was so juicy. The service was outstanding. Doug was my waiter and he was so kind. After he found out I wasn't from Knoxville he went through the menu with me and was so super helpful. I am definitely going back!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Robert B.,"Knoxville, TN",3/27/2017,4.0,"Good fried chicken and great sides.Pros:  Brand new building, but when you walk in the decor makes it look like it has been there forever.  Kind of an old diner vibe.  Interesting.  Food was really good.  Chicken was spicy but not real hot.  Perfect.  My wife doesn't like spicy food so she got the chicken tenders.  They were still a bit spicy for her so I don't know how much kids would like them.  The sides are awesome.  The slaw is sweet, wonderful.  Great baked beans.  (I love beans!).  Mac-n-cheese is delightful.  Fried green tomatoes were very hot, be careful not to burn yourself.  Dipping sauce is yummy.  Fried okra is good though it was a bit overcooked.  Service was really good and the servers help one another.  If they see a need, they take care of you even if it is not their table.  Good teamwork guys.  Cold beer, decent selection of bottles, no draft.  Clean.Cons:  Kind of expensive for chicken and fixin's but it is good.  If it was cheaper, I'd give it 5 stars.  Very noisy.  Soften wall and ceiling surfaces.All in all, a great meal.  I'll be back."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jennifer G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/23/2019,4.0,Good food and neat environment.  It isn't my first choice but that's not because they don't make a great menu of food.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",4/9/2017,2.0,"Our chicken today was sick. Wondering if we hit it on a bad day since the other reviews are all so good. Ours tasted like it was fried in dirty, days old oil. The breast was slightly better than the thigh, but still bad. I'm sad."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Lily F.,"Hialeah, FL",10/30/2017,5.0,"Greasy glory! Called in a pick up order for a half of a chicken plate.  This comes with a side of beans and slaw.  I ordered extra sides of mac and cheese and greens.  I also order 2 pieces of their friend catfish.  The catfish is so well seasoned, light and flaky!  So good!  The greens are flavorful and juicy.  The mac and cheese is thick.  The slaw is creamy.  The beans are just delightful!  Then the fried chicken is everything you are craving.  It is crunchy, well seasoned, and juicy!  The call in order came through correctly.  The service was great! Although it is a chain they gave a 5 star commitment to southern food"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jamie L.,"Sevierville, TN",10/7/2020,5.0,"Stopped at Gus's for our first time this past weekend.  It was clean, service was fantastic and friendly, and the food was delicious.  The chicken had some zip to it, but It wasn't just heat.  It had great flavor to go with a decent amount of heat that seemed to build the more you ate.  I can't speak to the sides but my family thought they were pretty great also.  Will definitely be back."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Alan S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/30/2019,4.0,Had the pleasure of eating lunch here with a few friends and it was enjoyable. If your not into fried foods stay away but the sides are really good. Speaking of sides the potato salad is great and so are the baked beans. I ordered a half of chicken and that included two sides (guess my sides lol)! The vibe at this place is good and that includes the music . So if your in the mood for some fried chicken and good R & B give this place a try.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Susan G.,"Oak Ridge, TN",8/30/2020,5.0,"Best $10 meal I can remember!  I had the three tenders meal, substituting the fried okra for baked beans.  There was so much food, I had to spread it over two meals, but every bite was delicious.  The fried okra was honestly the best I've EVER had and the coleslaw complimented the slightly spicy chicken.  I ordered takeout and the staff was friendly and attentive--even calling me by name.  I will be back soon!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kathleen F.,"Knoxville, TN",8/31/2019,3.0,"I really wanted to love this food, especially for a cheat day with fried food. My husband had ate there once and enjoyed the food and a few folks had highly recommended. First off the customer service was great, very friendly, clean establishment, great music. Ordered, 8 piece mix chicken, hush puppies, catfish, greens & fried okra, for take out which was quick.  The catfish was thin with a hard batter that lacked flavor, same for the chicken. Sometimes fresh cooking oil can make the difference as this was early evening. The okra was just ok and the hush puppies had a nice kick, loved the greens, good seasoning."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Michael P.,"Knoxville, TN",10/15/2018,5.0,"If I may quote Aretha Franklin from Blues Brothers""Best damn Chicken in the state...""!!! There is nothing bad to say about this place!!! The chicken is not the only thing that is great here...the sides are phenomenal and the staff are some of the nicest people I've ever met.For great food, friendly service and an overall wonderful dining experience then get your ass down to see Gus!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,K C.,"Phoenix, AZ",11/19/2018,5.0,"This place is great. I'm sure every review says the chicken is kinda spicy. It is, but the true beauty is the wing special. These are not just the puny little wings and drums. It is the entire leg quarter! Also we love the kids cup and have a small collection of them growing in the Tupperware drawer at home."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Matt M.,"Newport, TN",8/15/2020,5.0,The best chicken I've ever had! Had a little bit of a kick to it but it's sooooo good. Great environment friendly staff and the best dang chicken in town also they have a outside patio to sit at. The Mac and cheese wasn't homemade but the okra was delicious
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Maria V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",8/13/2020,5.0,Amazing service. Great fried chicken. Great prices. Overall so so good!! Coming back to this place for sure. Mac and cheese was on point! Beans and slaw were also amazing.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Barbara C.,"Coral Springs, FL",6/7/2019,5.0,"Best chicken I ever ate.  Like the light coating on the chicken and the spice.  Some many not be able to take the spice but we love it.  Gus's was recommended by a neighbor, they were right on.  Wish Gus's were closer to our home in Tellico.  On second thought maybe it is a good thing to be a distance would frequent too often instead of being a treat."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Nina H.,"Skokie, IL",6/3/2019,5.0,"Driving through Knoxville and had a craving for fried chicken! Gus's just provided us the best fried chicken experience!The chicken had a crisp and crunchy outside, with a moist, tender and juicy inside. The best ever!We had the fried green tomatoes and hush puppies ( not listed in the menu but was available when inquired about it) as appetizer, collard greens, Mac and cheese and coleslaw for sides. Servers were all so friendly and attentive. The restaurant is has a nice and relax ambience.A must visit for a great chicken dining experience!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Trisha J.,"Perryville, MD",2/21/2018,4.0,"I am not a fan of chicken but my companion has wanted to try Gus's for years so we went.  i thought i could find something else on the menu.  Wrong!  only chicken on the menu.  i got the 3 piece tenders and she got the 3 piece light.  She liked her chicken;  i love spicy but thought this was rather mild than hot 'n spicy. The beans and slaw were excellent and the food was served piping hot.Our server, Portia, was a gem...kept our drinks filled without being asked, was very pleasant and cheerful. Food is served on styrofoam with plastic eating utensils...the atmosphere was that of being at a picnic.we tried the pies..pecan, which my friend said was ""disappointing"" and i wanted to try the chess pie, it was disgusting!we probably will not go back again."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Rick E.,"Franklin, TN",5/31/2019,5.0,Like this Gus's - have been to the original ones in Memphis and this is a good copy.  Good beans and slaw to go with great Chicken.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Matt R.,"Oak Ridge, TN",6/18/2017,3.0,"If you enjoy spicy chicken you will love this place.  If you don't, they really don't have an option for you.  The service was great though!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Holly S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/19/2019,5.0,"Man, I tell you what this is some good chicken! I love this place and the staff is very friendly!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Joni B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/6/2018,5.0,"Quality for the price is unbeatable! Love the sides, especially the fried okra. And the chicken is just the PERFECT level of spice."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Amanda B.,"Kodak, TN",8/4/2018,3.0,I'm a little torn about how I feel. On one hand I like the chicken and I think it's a different/good flavor. On the other hand it's just too inconsistent. Some days I've been very pleased and then days like today I'm disappointed. I got the 8 piece mixed like usual. The breasts were really small and one of the thighs needed cooked longer. I don't live close so I visit the first Saturday of every month when I'm in town. I don't know if I'll be back again but if I do I'll dine in and see if it differs from carryout.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Michelle W.,"Delray Beach, FL",8/2/2018,5.0,Amazing! We are going back when we're in town again! It was so good we took home a bunch for dinner!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ashton S.,"Nashville, TN",7/31/2018,5.0,"This place is great! I was very shocked to learn it was a chain because it gives a ""small town, mom-and-pop joint"" vibe. The chicken was delicious and cooked well and you get a lot for your money. This is our new favorite chicken joint!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Silece M.,"Knoxville, TN",7/28/2018,5.0,"Huge chicken wings, didn't need any sauce and we couldn't stop eating until it was gone. It was amazing, cant wait ro go back."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Shelby B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/21/2018,5.0,"Probably one of the best fried chicken spots I've ever had. The chicken was crispy, juicy, with a little kick. Mac and cheese, fried pickles, and coke slaw were just perfect. The staff was AMAZING, on point, and just really awesome."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,John B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/20/2018,3.0,"This is about the 10th time I've had Gus' chicken and I would say this visit was not the best. Atypical, the chicken was dry tonight. I can't tell you if it's a new guy on the fryers or just a batch that was not looked after. The sides were good.I had the sweet potato pie, which I never order dessert. It was missing some key ingredients. Lacked sugar and cinnamon, crust was really good.I hope this is a single incident as I can't go back to KY fried which is not bone dry but there is about a quart of oil with each fried breast. I hope the chicken was just not looked after on this batch."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Naomi C.,"Denver, CO",7/19/2018,2.0,"OK, so there is  ALOT of hype about this place. I don't think its such a big deal. The staff is hella friendly and the service is fast, I'll grant you that, however the food is average- nothing special. It's always crowded at lunch and has an extremely small parking lot. It's local so support is good."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kate M.,"Seaford, NY",7/17/2018,4.0,"I was driving to Nashville this weekend when all of a sudden I was struck with a craving for fried chicken (weird, right?) I perused through Yelp and found myself on the way to Gus's.I was treated with such hospitality as soon as I walked through the door - very kind staff who could tell I was from out of town and needed help.The food was great! (I normally do not like hot, spicy fried chicken which burns your mouth and ruins the flavors for the rest of the meal.) I was worried at first, as most southern joints have chicken with a strong kick to it. Gus's chicken has a mild level of spice and was very tolerable for me, with just the right amount of heat and crunch.  The coleslaw was hands down the best I've ever had at any BBQ joint. The slaw combined with the sweetness of the baked beans toned down the spice on the chicken which really made it that much more enjoyable. The Mac and cheese was kind of one note and didn't have too much flavor, which was the only downside. Did I mention the Pecan pie? What's a trip to the south without a slice of pie!? Which by the way, was the perfect level of crunchy and sweet, a great way to end my meal.I'm certainly glad I stopped in on my trip and would recommend Gus's to anyone traveling from out of town."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Katie K.,"Las Vegas, NV",7/13/2018,5.0,"We were spending the night in Knoxville and wanted a place to go for dinner that we couldn't have at home. We got there about an hour before they closed but they were very welcoming.  The atmosphere is casual.We started with the fried green tomatoes which were delicious.  I had the chicken, my husband had the cat fish and our kids had grilled cheese. There was almost nothing left when we were done.  The chess and pecan pie were awesome, too.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ellen L.,"Market East, Philadelphia, PA",1/29/2019,5.0,"Love this place. Very informal lunch and dinner. Service is enthusiastic and people here seem to love what they do. Food is great tho limited range, but ok by me. My favorite is the fried catfish--nicely done people!"

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Robert S.,"Knoxville, TN",9/1/2016,4.0,"Let's start with the good parts.1. Devon, our server, was hard working and eager to please. He's soft spoken and this place is LOUD, so if I were to offer him any advice it would be to speak up.2. Every one was very polite and helpful. More restaurants fail because of poor quality of service. (Looking at you, Ruby Tuesday) As long as the folks at Gus's maintain this service level, they'll be in good shape.3. The chicken is good. Not great, but good. I would prefer a little more spice and/or heat.Now, for the parts that can improve:1. The fried pickles were very good. Long, crispy spears with a crunchy batter. However, $6.50 for 6 pickles is way too much.2. As mentioned earlier, this place is loud. The layout and poor acoustics forces everyone to talk louder than normal, and when that happens, the voices reverberate and echo. Maybe put some sound tiles to absorb some of the noise.3. It can't be fixed, but getting into and parking is very cramped. Narrow spaces and 90 degree angles makes for a lot of maneuvering. I expect there will be more than a few door dings happen in the near future.Overall, Gus's has the right formula."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Cameron E.,"Knoxville, TN",2/18/2017,4.0,"After talking to a few of my friends and Seeing that Alton Brown had recommended this place to his fans, I needed to try this place-out! Me and a few of my friends drove down to see whats what. I am from the south, so I know and love my southern cuisine, that includes fried chicken. So I ordered the  3 piece dark meat chicken, with baked beans, and a medium macaroni and cheese. The chicken was hot and juicy! The macaroni was cheesy, creamy and delicious, the beans where very good and savory too! If you like fried chicken and southern food, you should make Gus's on your next stop!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Cedric K.,"Humboldt, TN",5/26/2017,5.0,"For all the chickens lovers out there this is the place to visit. The fried chicken, potato salad, and baked beans were delicious."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Daniel M.,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",2/18/2019,5.0,"I like to think I'm well traveled and can tell good food and service when I encounter it. With that being said, this is hands down, the best fried chicken I've ever had. Additionally, the staff didn't have that fake, I-hate-my-job friendliness. Instead, they were genuinely kind, warm, and welcoming. If you tend to like spicy food, this chicken is perfect for you. If you're sensitive to any level of spicy however, it might be a little hot for you."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tracey T.,"Hollywood, FL",12/18/2019,5.0,"This was hands-down the best fried chicken my husband and I have ever had. If you don't like spicy food, do not go to this restaurant. The service was excellent and friendly. The next time we are in the area, we are definitely stopping by."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Justin R.,"Durham, NC",2/15/2017,4.0,"Slightly spicy chicken that fried very hard (like you-can-eat-the-bones-hard). I opted out of the sides on this one, since I find that places that specialize in fried chicken often can't muster enough energy or time to make delicious vegetables. This is the perfect place to grab chicken from on your way to a picnic with your family.Pros:fast servicegreat chickeninexpensiveCons:loud atmospherelimited selection of sideslimited parking"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kevin S.,"Corryton, TN",2/13/2019,3.0,So so food.....love the service and friendliness but the sides were very average. Chicken is fresh and tasty. Definitely worth a try . I know I am being picky!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jessica L.,"Andersonville, TN",11/19/2017,4.0,"My husband and I have heard about Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken for a while and had the opportunity to try it. I got the 2 piece which comes with a breast and a wing and 2 sides. I got potato salad and coleslaw. My husband got the 4 piece tenders with baked beans. The food came out very fast and hot. My chicken was a little spicy but it was very good. My husband loved the tenders. The baked beans and potato salad were ok but I really enjoyed the coleslaw. Next time we go I will get the tenders and try their desserts. The staff were very attentive and extremely nice! Overall, it was a nice experience and I would recommend it."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Joni B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/6/2018,5.0,"Quality for the price is unbeatable! Love the sides, especially the fried okra. And the chicken is just the PERFECT level of spice."

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,paul s.,"Knoxville, TN",9/5/2016,3.0,"I got there today, Labor day at 10:45AM.  I was the first.  By the time we had placed our order and received the food, the place was packed.  11:15AM.  The owner was very nice and indicated that they had been overwhelmed by the crowds.  We ate on the patio as we brought our dog.  They brought our food to us even though the patio service was closed.  My review of the sides we had was mac and cheese, collard greens, fried okra and cole slaw.  All was above average but not great.  I had two thighs and my friend had a breast and wing.  Mine was overcooked for my taste.  The chicken is friend with no crust, just a highly spiced skin that is not very hot.  The chicken pieces were smaller than I expected.  I think it has a very good potential but it has not reached there yet.Parking lot was full by 11:15AM and people was parking on the street and anyplace else they could find."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ugochi M.,"Lanham, MD",2/15/2018,3.0,"I've been to the Gus's in Maryland and it was so dang good. This location was a bit underwhelming. First of all, I got my food to go and my whole car smelled like burnt chicken. I was upset thinking that my food was not going to be good. Thankfully, nothing was burnt but unfortunately the opposite. Anyway, I ate a chicken leg on the way home and it just wasn't the same as the one in Maryland. It lacked that punch of flavor and spice and was a tad bit dry. When I got home, I tore into the thigh piece only to find it was still pink and a lil bit of blood...DISAPPOINTING! However, the macaroni and cheese, greens, and baked beans were all really good. Maybe they were having a bad day but it was disappointing since I drove 20 minutes for it."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Sarah H.,"Louisville, TN",3/28/2019,5.0,First tried Gus's at the original location in Memphis and fell in love. Everything is good here. My favorite though is getting a two piece with potato salad and macaroni and cheese with some orange soda. They do soul food right.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Anton E.,"Knoxville, TN",3/24/2020,4.0,"Great fried chicken! I've been going here for years! Back when I went to UT, this place was a staple, which probably led to that freshman 15 (plus some). Seriously though, it's great food. The staff is always friendly and fast. It's a good spot for southern home-cooking. My one negative, is the chicken tenders. I'm not a fan, but... that's why it's known for fried chicken, and not fried tenders! The fried chicken itself is hard to beat, and the sides are great too! Good spot."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Charlie S. W.,"Powell, TN",8/10/2018,4.0,"Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The seasoning blend in their flour has just the right amount of spice to leave you wanting more. Reasonable prices, great service! Also don't leave without trying the fried okra!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Leah K.,"Torrey, UT",5/8/2017,5.0,"Definitely the best fried chicken I've ever had. It's everything fried chicken should be.  Juicy and crispy and spicy and just wonderful. Plus, it was flavorful all the way through to the bone. The service was awesome and prompt and the atmosphere was great.All in all a GREAT experience."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Michael T.,"Knoxville, TN",6/19/2018,4.0,"Excellent fried chicken and Southern sides. I rarely ever eat friend chicken--maybe once every year or two--and I wanted to give the whole hot chicken craze a try. It was really good and so were the greens, mac n cheese, cole slaw and beans. The staff were very friendly too. I personally would like the chicken to be really HOT and Spicy, but I could have added hot sauce to kick it up. This place is solid and great for lunch or for a casual dinner."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Shasha W.,"Near East Columbus, Columbus, OH",3/2/2019,5.0,"Just ate here..our server was Sarah ,I cannot say enough good things about this place and service,we had 5 people in our group,we are all very picky eaters the food here not only looked appealing to the eye but was just as tasty,we had a little of everything,home made sweet potato pie excellent..! Pecan pie warmed with vanilla ice cream superb..! Coconut chess pie also great..we had Mac n cheese,greens,baked beans,the cole slaw ,chicken fingers ,chicken breast  and chicken wings everything was fantabulous...!!! I recommend all of it and if you can get Sarah as your server it's just that much better ..we are food connoisseurs we travel all over just to eat,!! And it's on rare occasions we get great food and friendly service with personality..we will be back"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ben F.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",4/3/2017,5.0,"Really great Fried Chicken! I've never had ""Hot Chicken"" before, so I can't compare, but it was super crispy and moist. I expected it to be spicier and for it to be dipped in a sauce, but it was still really tasty. The Potato Salad was really sweet and creamy and the mac and cheese was pretty standard. I had also seen some Hot Chicken from Nashville that had pickles speared into the top of the Chicken, but when I asked for pickles, they didn't have any. Besides that, an awesome addition to the Knoxville food scene."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Keo D.,"Knoxville, TN",10/22/2016,4.0,"This isn't ""hot chicken"" like you'd get in Nashville. It's spicy and slightly hot. Juicy and nice crisp skin. Sides I tried were greens and mac n cheese. Mac is very creamy and taste good. The greens same, not too salty. I also tried the fried green tomatoes,  held up well and had a crunch too. I'm a little disappointed cause they messed up my order for the pie slices I wanted to try. The lady assured me everything was in the bags. I got back home and everything except the pie slices were there. Somewhat my fault , I just didn't want to stand there making sure,  wasn't free space to. 25 minutes back home and food was hot and or very warm. So I loved that. I called back and a manager came on the line when I said what happened. He offered me the slices and a 10 dollar gift card. Very nice. I wanted just the refund but that was nice considering I'll be back cause it was likely an honest mistake. I wrote down who I spoke to and what was offered. Next time I go in, I'll essentially have a paid meal. I just didn't feel like driving back. Parking is limited, but I lucked out. It is busy, I went there around noon. The sign is visible but can be passed since it's not at a light. I'll be back, I'd be interested if they made a regular chicken as well and not just hot n spicy."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Taylor H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/8/2017,3.0,"Most everyone who knows me understands my love for a good piece of fried chicken (or skin only *my friends do not judge)  So the anticipation of Gus' Knox opening was nothing short of a BIG deal. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff couldn't be more courteous. The chicken receives a 7 out of 10 for me. Nice spice and always fresh to order however I expected more from the ""world famous"" joint. The sides are ok. Just ok. I've never met a mac-n-cheese I didn't like but when you put paprika and shredded cheese on Stouffers mac it's still Stouffers mac."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,David R.,"Ethridge, TN",1/3/2017,5.0,Whoo Absolutely Fantastic fried chicken. If ya haven't been there.... What are you waiting on! The chicken is so moist and delightful. The sides are great too!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Robin J.,"Marietta, GA",12/14/2018,5.0,My favorite place to get spicy fresh cooked chicken in town. Service is always awesome. Sides are to die for and so is the desserts. You will not be disappointed!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,A-Kick M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2/9/2019,4.0,Their fried chicken is crispy and spicy. I liked the texture of the fried chicken. Their fried tomato is really good with ranch and it was still good even when it got cold.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Lauren M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/16/2017,4.0,"The only reason I leave off 1 star is because the chicken tastes different from time to time. Now, I recognize this as a sign of using fresh ingredients and/or whipping up the seasonings a bit differently each day, like a snow flake, which is a pleasing thought. But man, when I go out for fried chicken I have a LOT of options, and I want to count on the chicken tasting like the incredible fried seasoning I deliberately chose. It's hardly a complaint though. They may have the second best greens in town! And the mac and cheese is damn good too. Always very kind, very attentive service. And they are open on Mondays, when most of the best restaurants in town are closed."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,David D.,"Amherst, NH",5/6/2018,5.0,"We stopped here on our way to Tuscaloosa and we are so glad we did!  First, if you don't want fried chicken, don't stop here (as that is all they have), but if you are looking for delicious, fresh, juicy fried chicken, this is your place!I was with my wife and my father. My wife thought it was the best fried chicken she's had. She also got mac n cheese side, which she enjoyed, but the chicken was the main event. My dad got the half chicken - be warned, the pieces are huge!  Half was probably too much for him. He really enjoyed it, but the breading is a bit spicy (perhaps a bit too much for him). He got the standard slaw and beans on the side, which were very good. I had a quarter chicken - the breast was huge, tender and delicious. You can substitute different sides for a small surcharge- I swapped the slaw for fried okra, which was quite good. This is a must stop if you are looking for good fried chicken!!!"

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,John C.,"Memphis, TN",10/26/2019,5.0,We had fried chicken from their Memphis store and were very excited to see this Knoxville one open. The fried chicken is great dining in or getting it to go.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kippy P.,"Knoxville, TN",3/31/2017,5.0,"Enjoyed a delicious lunch here today. Great food and top notch service! Loved the atmosphere. Definitely worth checking out. I had the 2 piece white which comes with a breast and a wing. Skin was crispy, seasoned well and the meat was tender and juicy. Can't forget the delicious sides. I tried the macaroni and cheese and fried okra. Okra was breaded well and was hot and crispy when I received it."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Emily E.,"Williamsburg, VA",10/13/2019,4.0,Finally tried Gus's and it did not disappoint! This is the best chicken restaurant in Knoxville. Skip Myrtles and come here instead! I recommend ordering a tender plate not a bone-in plate. The mac and cheese and slaw weren't quite as impressive at the chicken but they were good!!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Alex S.,"San Jose, CA",7/30/2019,4.0,"I came here on my visit to PA school at south college.  Everything was very good and the server sooper friendly.  Got a fried chicken plate with fried okra, and collard greens.  Also a slice of pecan pie.  The fried chicken itself is breaded and salted, but no actual spice in the breading.  They give you a full bottle of hot sauce to make it how you like it though.  Would definitely come back here and try more stuff."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ashley S.,"Knoxville, TN",8/26/2018,5.0,BEST. FRIED CHICKEN. EVER. I just can't make myself eat fried chicken from anywhere else after having Gus's! They have phenomenal fried catfish as well!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ashton S.,"Nashville, TN",7/31/2018,5.0,"This place is great! I was very shocked to learn it was a chain because it gives a ""small town, mom-and-pop joint"" vibe. The chicken was delicious and cooked well and you get a lot for your money. This is our new favorite chicken joint!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jennifer L.,"Chicago, IL",10/23/2017,5.0,"Truly the best fried chicken. I got the 3 piece dark (2 thighs, 1 leg). The skin was thin, crispy, and flavorful, and the meat was SO juicy!! Such a great price too! The mac and cheese had a great taste, too. The food came out very quickly while it was nice and hot. I would love to come here again if I were in Knoxville!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kacey A.,"Whittier, CA",1/19/2017,5.0,By far the best fried chicken I've ever had! Not only is the food awesome but the atmosphere and people in this place make it even better. Had the sweetest waitress. Definitely will be going back
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Brian O.,"Pompano Beach, FL",4/30/2018,3.0,"After looking for something local and different we decided to give Gus' a shot. As you are driving to it, you might think this is going to be one of those hole in th wall shacks. Then it comes up and it is this fairly newer brick building that sets a little higher than the rest of the buildings. When you walk inside it looks like you stepped into an old country restaurant, nothing fancy. We sat outside under the trees. There are about four tables outside. The menu is pretty basic and not too big. I ordered the 3 piece dark meat with baked beans and mac n cheese. The baked beans weren't very good, too much ketchup. I could tell by the color that it was going to be like that. The mac n cheese was pretty good. Now let's talk about the chicken. The color was a dark brown. It was super crispy. The meat was extremely moist. It did have a slight kick but nothing that overpowered the taste. It was very good. The servers could have had a little more of a personality and been nicer. The one young lady that is leaving to go to school was outstanding. She was upbeat, polite and had tons of energy. I will be back for the chicken and will change the sides I get."

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Drew H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/12/2019,4.0,"yesterday i went to Gus's for my first time. my wife and i shared a half a chicken with mac and cheese and greens for our sides. we got our 11 year old a 3 piece tender with a double side of mac and cheese. prior to our main courses, we shared a fried green tomato. i must say, absolutely everything that we ordered was ON POINT! especially the bone in fried chicken. absolutely to die for! the best fried chicken that i have ever had! for everything that i mentioned we spent $46 before our tip. that is the only reason this is not a 5 star review, is because the cost was higher than we anticipated. but the food was seriously killer. awesome stuff."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Laura R.,"Cypress, CA",7/11/2019,5.0,We tried nearly everything on the menu it feels like and we enjoyed it all! Hush puppies with the greens and potatoes salad makes for one delicious bite of heaven. The chicken was just as the reviews that sent us here described...juicy with the right amount of tasty crispiness. We also had the fried green tomatoes. I highly recommend them! Out server was friendly and helpful with suggestions...she is a real gem!  Thanks to everyone for a great meal!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Lori C.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",10/13/2018,5.0,"This is my favorite fried chicken hands down!!  We first visited in Memphis.  We were so excited when this opened in Knoxville.  If you haven't been yet, you need to!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Heather R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2017,4.0,"This chicken is everything fried chicken should be. Crispy, tender, juicy and full of flavor. Just the right amount of spice. The staff is friendly. The prices are reasonable. Perfect in every way. The only thing that kept me from a 5 star review is the sides. Not bad but not great. I have tried mac n cheese, slaw, beans, okra and greens, none of which seem to be homemade. Obviously it isn't Gus's World Famous Mac n Cheese, but still. I expect more than Stouffer's. Eat more chicken...at Gus's."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Christopher P.,"Detroit, MI",10/27/2017,5.0,"First time here, chicken was very tasty especially with the hot sauce at table side.  Slaw tastes home made, beans were decent.  Will definitely be back here and maybe will have to check out the one in Michigan next time I'm back in the D."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Danielle M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/23/2019,5.0,"Love, love, love!!! If you don't like spicy on any level this probably isn't for you. But I love all the spice!!! I have been here to sit and eat as well as ordered for pick-up too many times to count! Everyone is very friendly and the food always taste amazing! Definitely give it a try if you haven't."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Oliver K.,"Knoxville, TN",9/30/2019,5.0,Consistently great. Food is great and the staff is always so nice and helpful. Always leave wishing I could leave a bigger tip. Highly recommend.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Al J.,"Knoxville, TN",4/2/2017,5.0,"Second trip here, same experience. Excellent waiter. Got the 2-pc white with coleslaw & baked beans. Very good! Chicken was right out of the fryer, very crisp skin, spice you can taste but not too much heat. The wife's not a fan of hot/spicy but she really liked this chicken. Beans were just right, and the slaw was perhaps my favorite in Knoxville...crisp, a little sweet, shredded- not chopped into tiny bits. The iced tea was just right and kept full the entire meal. Arrived at 3:15 on Saturday to an almost-full house; the waiter says it's like this all weekend, so if you're not a fan of crowds a weekday might be better for you. And great service, impressive given the crowd size."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Blake W.,"Knoxville, TN",6/28/2017,5.0,Best fried chicken ever. It is a little on the spicy side but made it that much better. Mac and cheese is really good to. The only bad part is the only the have is loaf bread. No rolls no biscuits. But other than that it is very good.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Rick H.,"Clinton, TN",1/28/2018,3.0,"Great atmosphere and service.  Chicken was fried a little too long for me, but still very juicy on the inside.  Sides were small but tasty.  Fried green tomatoes were very good"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Frances A.,"Las Vegas, NV",8/1/2017,4.0,"Chicken is very good.  Would have been 5 stars, but the last few visits did not agree with me.  May be getting sensitive to the spice.  Service is always great.  Hardly a wait.  Atmosphere is always fun and relaxing.  Parking can get crazy at lunch time."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Carlton S.,"Knoxville, TN",9/18/2019,5.0,I think of this place nearly every moment of the day. Please take me back!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jade A.,"Knoxville, TN",9/8/2018,3.0,"The fried chicken here is, hands down, the best!  It comes out super hot and fresh and you cannot beat it.  The sides are not so great.  We never like them.  Every now and then my husband gets me to agree to go and just eat chicken though, and it does not disappoint!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Justin D.,"Lenoir City, TN",9/6/2018,1.0,"Chicken was horrible. Dry, lacking of flavor or any kind of spice. Macaroni was disgusting. Tasted like it came our of a box with some shredded not all the way melted cheese and some paprika sprinkled on top. My 2 year old makes better mac and cheese. The fried okra and pickles were good but of course they are frozen. No salt and pepper or ketchup on table. Employees were flamboyantly ghetto holding loud conversations about personal life. Slow service. Famous for what is the question."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Lindsay S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/1/2018,5.0,"Delicious, hot and juicy every time we go!! Great service, always on top of things and we can't wait to return!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Adrienne D.,"Knoxville, TN",8/18/2018,5.0,I love the spicy chicken and the southern style cuisine. There aren't many places in Knoxville to pick up fried green tomatoes and okra on the go but this place is awesome. The servers are also always polite and have never treated my badly. I go all the time and the service is great.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Brandon P.,"Maryville, TN",9/21/2017,4.0,"The chicken here is to die for. A bit big for just one person, which is not a horrible problem, but the flavor is savory and southern flare at its best. It has a decent size area for eating and bathrooms that are fairly clean! I would definitely go back. You have to be careful not to miss it, there is only one way in and out! Oh but it is worth it"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ashley C.,"Maryville, TN",8/16/2019,5.0,"The best chicken I've ever had hands down. Also tried the mac and cheese, greens, chess and pecan pie. Friendly staff and great service."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Nancy H.,"Sevierville, TN",3/23/2017,3.0,First time to Gus'.  Great cole slaw and the baked beans were ok!  The fried chicken was fair.  I hadbtge 2 piece white.  Next time I will get the wings bc they were real meaty.  My husband had the 2 piece dark.  Lots of people were enjoying lunch there.  There wSs a problem with their credit card machine and it took a while.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jack Q.,"Fort Worth, TX",11/6/2017,4.0,Enjoyed the staff being friendly and Helpful.  The Gus standard food quality is there.  Would not recommend the Coconut pie.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Diana S.,"Morgantown, WV",6/5/2019,5.0,"My husband and I were in Knoxville for a softball tournament and found this restaurant after searching for something local with good reviews. We were NOT disappointed.   We arrived before the dinner rush and received a friendly greeting when we entered the restaurant. Our waitress ""Amy"" was personable and very knowledgeable about the restaurant, menu items etc. and answered all of our questions with a smile!  We ordered and our food arrived piping hot and smelling delicious. My husband ordered the half chicken with beans and greens and I ordered the 3 piece dark plate with fried okra and cole slaw.  I also added a side of macaroni and cheese.  I am including pictures with this review so you can see all of the items.  Everything was wonderful.  The helpings were plentiful and the chicken had just the right amount of spice kick without being too fiery.  It was just a great all round good experience.  ""Amy"" refilled our drinks to go.  No room for dessert."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Wendy C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/17/2017,4.0,"The chicken was to die for, best I have ever had, by far.  The sides were not at all interesting but the warm pecan pie with ice cream was as great as the chicken.  Very very VERY excited to go back."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Turner M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/12/2018,4.0,"If you're searching for Nashville style hot chicken, this place will leave you wanting more. Though the spice is not present, the flavor is very good and makes Gus's have some of the best chicken in town for a very affordable price and different deals daily."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Wensdae H.,"Knoxville, TN",9/2/2016,5.0,"So good I could cry tears of joy! The management staff is so kind and friendly I really felt taken care of come check it out it really is famous chicken! Come try the Chess Pie, it's heaven!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Debra K.,"Bluff City, TN",7/11/2019,5.0,Wonderful place. Outstanding fried chicken and all the sides were delicious as well. Came home and mentioned to our daughter. She used to eat at Gus's in Mason TN all the time.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Charlie A.,"Knoxville, TN",5/9/2018,5.0,"I never craved fried chicken before. Now I eat here almost once a week. Moist and spicy, though not ""Nashville Hot"" spicy. Best fried chicken I've ever had. Period."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Eric A.,"New York, NY",8/27/2017,5.0,"I ate here regularly as a student in Memphis (where this chain originated), and have never been disappointed! The chicken is spicy yet tender, with a crisp skin that falls off in favor of juicy meat. The sides are also fantastic, particularly the macaroni & cheese and cole slaw. Their beer selection and dessert is also amazing. You really can't go wrong with this place, but be prepared to take a nap after you eat, because it is filling and satisfying as hell!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Emma J.,"San Francisco, CA",7/6/2019,5.0,"Don't know much about their restaurant itself, but they catered to the office that I work at one day and they had the BEST chicken I've ever tasted. They only came with the option of chicken tenders with mac&cheese or fries, but all three were absolutely delicious. So glad I got to try it, and I wish they'd come again. 15/10"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Minion B.,"Kingsport, TN",6/29/2017,5.0,"The food is delicious, service is awesome, and the free side just because they served the main course before the appetizer was also good."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Amy G.,"Knoxville, TN",12/8/2017,5.0,"1st time visiting and we will be back! Warmly greeted by several staff as soon as we walked in the door, we were able to seat ourselves right away in the clean and inviting dining room. Do yourself a favor and ask for our waitress, Kenyatta. She arrived at table immediately, took our drink and app order and told us the specials of the day. My tea glass never got below a half a glass and that's a make it or break it for me. We have the fried green tomatoes to start and they were fantastic! Our meal arrived and the chicken was hot, fresh and had just the right amount of kick to it. The mac & cheese was delicious as well. The fries were a little to spicy for my taste, but still hot and fresh. Overall, a fantastic experience and will go back. Looking forward to the banana pudding when they get it on the menu!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Hugh A.,"Knoxville, TN",9/23/2016,4.0,"Since I am from the Memphis area (an underrated foody place if there ever was) I had to reconnect with my roots,so to speak, and eat at Gus's Fried Chicken. Gus's is famous for its ""hot"" fried chicken so I stopped in for lunch. First observation I'll make is the place was crazy busy it took a little time to get served. I was kind of in a rush but I'll forgive--it's relatively new. The food was excellent got a 3 piece white meat meal with baked beans and fries. The chicken was cooked well and the sides were pretty good. I could see this being a very popular place---the Sutherland area is growing with a few other popular eateries on the same street. I would recommend Gus's if you like Southern delicacy or fries chicken (it's definitely better than KFC)!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Aaron C.,"Bloomfield, NJ",3/21/2017,5.0,Best fried chicken this side of heaven! It's always fresh and juicy with just the right kick. It's also cool they put to go chicken in a brown paper bag.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,OccasionalReviewer Z.,"Bellevue, WA",9/2/2017,4.0,"Nice. Chicken was well done; golden and crispy. Service was very courteous. Would have loved the chicken to be spicier, but it was definitely not bland."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jeff P.,"Knoxville, TN",10/1/2016,5.0,Best fried chicken in town but also the most expensive.  I  love the Chess pie too. Normally very crowded and always worth the wait.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Raquel B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/27/2017,4.0,"Delicious fried chicken. Usually I stay away from fried foods but this quite delicious. Juicy chicken, the batter is nice and crispy, does not taste or feel too greasy. Mac and cheese is decent, not my favorite though. Definitely recommend and will come back."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Richard N.,"Knoxville, TN",3/20/2018,5.0,AWESOME FOOD!!!!!!!Had excellent chicken and fries.Also has great service as they took care of problems.This is one of my family's favorite restaurants in Knoxville.We will definitely come here again.Gus's Fried Chicken  is the best of all fried chicken places in Knoxville!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Heath N.,"Knoxville, TN",1/9/2017,5.0,"I've been to the Memphis, Atlanta, and Knoxville locations. They're all wonderful! Off the chart fried chickens. NO JOKE! Who in the heck would give Gus' Fried Chicken 1-3 stars?! This is a 5-star food."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Hayley W.,"Knoxville, TN",11/12/2016,4.0,"I got some of the chicken breast, tenders, okra, and fried green tomatoes here and the fried chicken breast was the best I've ever had. It had the right amount of spice and was super juicy. The tenders were good but I really couldn't taste the spice as much as I did with the breast. The fried green tomatoes were also tasty, with a must have cornmeal breading. Okra was good, but nothing special. Definately would go back and get the fried chicken, never had anything like that!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Scott C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/15/2017,5.0,Great food and Great service! Always a must on our food fix. Chicken is magic for sure.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Damon E.,"Raleigh, NC",10/24/2017,5.0,Food was served extremely fresh and hot. The gentleman that took out order was very polite. Had the catfish and it was great except it was a tad bit too salty. If in Knoxville definitely check them out.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Porscha C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/1/2018,3.0,Supper nice and friendly staff! The chicken is really good and so is the pie but the sides are pretty average and kinda pricey for what you get. I had gotten the beans and Mac and cheese and they were very average the Mac and cheese tasted like the kind you get In the frozen food section in the grocery store and the beans were ok didn't seam supper fresh.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ann R.,"Milwaukee, WI",9/26/2016,3.0,"This is a fried chicken place that only serves the chicken one way, which means it's not hot enough for the true ""hot chicken"" connoisseurs and a bit too hot for those with more *ahem* sensitive palates. The chicken was juicy, the baked beans and the mac n cheese were good sides, but overall the food didn't quite justify the price tag. A four-tender plate (with one substituted side for fried okra) and an additional medium side of mac n cheese came to around $20. The environment was okay, a little too loud to be comfortable. No reason not to check it out, but no reason to come back again anytime soon either."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Michael D.,"Powell, TN",1/16/2018,3.0,The food was delicious. The chicken flavorful and crispy.  The sides were yummy.  The amount of styrofoam used made me sad. We had used so much styrofoam from one dinner.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Misty M.,"TN, TN",1/12/2018,5.0,"The chicken is gooooood, but don't expect hot chicken here. It's not spicy but still taste very good. I'm in love with the mac 'n cheese; I could eat a large all by myself. And the chocolate chess pie with ice cream is wonderful."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tracy M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/11/2017,5.0,"Oh my gosh, believe the hype. This place is goooood.  Chicken is moist and crispy and just the right amount of spicy. Totally crave-able. Both times I've been, my boyfriend and I split the 3 piece meal and got an extra side and it's the perfect amount of food for us.  The cole slaw is the perfect side as it cools the mild heat from the chicken, and the macaroni and cheese is smooth and creamy.  The service is always prompt and super friendly.  If you want fried chicken in Knoxville, don't miss this."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Sam C.,"Savage, MN",4/5/2017,5.0,The most amazing chicken!!! Spicy and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Eating it as it was piping hot was also a part of the experience! Wish they would open a Gus's in the Twin Cities!!!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,R T.,"Knoxville, TN",9/7/2016,2.0,"Was excited to try this place, but was disappointed. We had to wait for a table as the place was packed. For 2 people our bill was $23, not including the tip. We had a 2 piece meal (med size chicken breast & a tiny wing) & a 3 piece chicken tender meal. It comes served on a paper plate with plastic utensils, drinks in styrofoam cups. (Styrofoam is terrible for landfills!) They serve the meal with a slice of white bread & 2 sides.  The baked beans had to be canned, fried okra was only fair.  Chicken is nothing special.Sutherland Avenue has a couple of new restaurants, I'm waiting for more to open. Hopefully more businesses & restaurants will come to Sutherland Avenue."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kristen P.,"Belle Chasse, LA",6/1/2017,5.0,We stopped by on our way through Knoxville and it was definitely worth it. The service was quick and friendly. The fried chicken was easily some of the best I've had. My son got mac and cheese and it was delicious!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,David W.,"Fort Sanders, Knoxville, TN",10/8/2017,3.0,"The food is good, but for hot chicken it wasn't that spicy. There is only 2 kind of hot you can get so not a lot of variety with spices. The service was a bit slow for the amount of total customers in the restaurant. The location is convenient because there is not a lot of a traffic around the area. The price is decent, but you get what you pay for."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Seth T.,"Knoxville, TN",10/6/2017,4.0,"The first I visited I wasn't impressed, early morning. I have been back at night every time since and have been very impressed. The chicken strips are special in a way that no one will soon forget. I would like a few other side items for variety and only having chicken causes problems with a few."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Austin M.,"Denver, CO",5/21/2017,5.0,BEHOLD THE WORLDS BEST FRIED CHICKEN! Order a side of Mac and Cheese along with sweet potato pie. P.S. - Britney is the best server here.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,LaDonna C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/24/2017,4.0,"Loved the chicken, okra, slaw and baked beans. Only been there once and I'm definitely going back again. The open atmosphere is maybe a little to down home.  Fantastic waiters everything was nice and clean."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Elton T.,"Vista, CA",2/25/2017,4.0,"Almost 5 stars! Not a big fan of the styrofoam plates/cups. Regular dishes are more economical, environmentally friendly, and better looking. The chicken was awesome. Perfect crunch and spice. The beans obviously came out of a can. I don't go to a restaurant to eat canned food. If they just get some real dishes and maybe some homemade sides, this place is an easy 5 stars!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Mira P.,"Atlanta, GA",9/6/2017,5.0,I love this fried chicken! It was so moist and flavorful!  The spices were right on!  It was so crispy!  The sides were okay.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Edward J.,"Knoxville, TN",3/3/2019,5.0,"We really do love this place.  Even though it's quite a drive from our home in west Knoxville, we go there often to experience the friendly service, the downhome ambiance and - of course - the great chicken, cooked and seasoned to perfection.  And don't forget their cole slaw, best in town. (Oh, and did I say their prices are great?)"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Caroline W.,"Nashville, TN",10/5/2016,5.0,So good!! The chicken came out very hot and so good! I would suggest getting a plate instead of separate pieces. The French fries and beans were great! Went on a Tuesday around 1:00. They were extremely busy but still good service!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Matthew F.,"Knoxville, TN",8/4/2017,1.0,"I had high expectations... Fresh Bojangles has better chicken! The best hot chicken I've ever had was from a food truck in Birmingham, Al called Eugene's hot chicken. Gus is nowhere close! Gus is not hot chicken!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Christopher M.,"Knoxville, TN",2/9/2019,5.0,"If you love fried chicken, this is a must go to location.  If you like greasy, forget it.  This place has crispy, moist, piping hot, fantastic chicken. The service is fast and friendly.   Couldnt ask for a better lunch experience.  I have become a regular."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jenny L.,"Murfreesboro, TN",2/27/2017,4.0,Great food and service. Will definitely be back! Only thing I would change is how cold it is in the restaurant. But it was a cold night outside so maybe that had something to do with it.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Benolyn C.,"Memphis, TN",9/25/2016,5.0,Best friend chicken ever!  The chicken is spicy but not to spicy and my kids love the tenders.  Reasonably priced for a family dinner or grab for a tailgate.  Chocolate pie is the bomb digity!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Benjamin M.,"Oak Ridge, TN",6/5/2017,5.0,"Fabulously perfect, spicy fried chicken like no other place on Earth served in a casual rustic setting.  Baked beans, seasoned french fries and biscuits are all delicious sides to add to the multiple fried chicken entrees.  My first visit was a perfect one. I look forward to eating here again and again."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Cameron E.,"Knoxville, TN",2/18/2017,4.0,"After talking to a few of my friends and Seeing that Alton Brown had recommended this place to his fans, I needed to try this place-out! Me and a few of my friends drove down to see whats what. I am from the south, so I know and love my southern cuisine, that includes fried chicken. So I ordered the  3 piece dark meat chicken, with baked beans, and a medium macaroni and cheese. The chicken was hot and juicy! The macaroni was cheesy, creamy and delicious, the beans where very good and savory too! If you like fried chicken and southern food, you should make Gus's on your next stop!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Justin R.,"Durham, NC",2/15/2017,4.0,"Slightly spicy chicken that fried very hard (like you-can-eat-the-bones-hard). I opted out of the sides on this one, since I find that places that specialize in fried chicken often can't muster enough energy or time to make delicious vegetables. This is the perfect place to grab chicken from on your way to a picnic with your family.Pros:fast servicegreat chickeninexpensiveCons:loud atmospherelimited selection of sideslimited parking"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Scott L.,"Buffalo, NY",1/31/2017,5.0,"Visited Guy's on a raining Monday night, totally worth the trip, best fried chicken I haven't had for a while, different than KFC, but is well cooked and a little salt, so many flavor while enjoying the chicken. I had the 5 or 7 piece combo, end up nearly finishing all of these. I will re-visit if come back to town. I ordered the take out, so didn't have many chance enjoy in the store, staff was very friendly though."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Brian S.,"Kodak, TN",1/30/2017,3.0,"This was my first visit to Gus. I read the reviews and wanted fried chicken so I made a special trip just for the famous fried chicken. I ordered my plate to go because I was eating In my car. I ordered a breast and a thigh but didn't get that (even though I was charged extra). The sides were great. The chicken did not taste fresh. It was hot and spicy but not fresh. To me, other than it being hot and spicy, which I could do with sauce, it was not worth the cost."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ashley T.,"Knoxville, TN",1/25/2017,5.0,"This is my first time eating here and will not be my last for sure.  I had the 2 piece dark and my date had the 2 piece white. Sides were Mac&cheese, okra, greens, and slaw. I thought all were excellent!  Im a big dark meat person but I actually liked the white meat better. Pieces were bigger and juicer. The place was packed but we got great service. Food came out quick and was hot and tasty. My only suggestion would be to be able to serve at different heat levels. I wanted a little more spicy and I hear many people say they want less spicy. Good Job Gus's!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Kacey A.,"Whittier, CA",1/19/2017,5.0,By far the best fried chicken I've ever had! Not only is the food awesome but the atmosphere and people in this place make it even better. Had the sweetest waitress. Definitely will be going back

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Noor M.,"Atlanta, GA",3/24/2018,3.0,The  chicken was good the sides were not all that great and for me customer service is very important and the lady with the red hair was not nice at all very hostile in her speech and seemed very annoyed by having to do her job. On top of that she got my order wrong and made my meal very anti climactic
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Andy B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/24/2016,5.0,"If you are in the mood for fried chicken and country-style side items, there is none better than Gus's! Plus you gotta love a place that serves quart-size cans of beer..."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Brittanie M.,"Spring Hill, TN",4/20/2018,5.0,A friend of mine introduced me to this place and it has not disappointed! The chicken is absolutely the best fried chicken I have ever had. Totally worth your time!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,M M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/12/2018,4.0,"I'm not a ""fried"" fan of anything but this was delicious and not very greasy. Crispy skin and moist, juicy meat inside. This particular evening they had catfish and it was also delicious, spicy and large portions. Sides were equally tasty! Service was great, but atmosphere seemed a bit rough."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jerad D.,"Knoxville, TN",3/3/2018,4.0,Food is still absolutely fantastic I love take out and dine in at Gus's and it's the only slaw that's any good only complaint was multiple times I asked for more tarter sauce and agreed to pay for it but it was never brought to me
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jerad D.,"Knoxville, TN",2/24/2018,5.0,The absolutely best fried chicken and fried fish in town love the spice and there coleslaw is knock your socks off good everyone needs to go here
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Erik G.,"Maryville, TN",9/21/2017,4.0,"I thought the chicken was good but the sides could have been a little better. If you want five star hot chicken, I recommend going to Jackie's Dream.  It's a locally-owned establishment off Magnolia Avenue. Jackie is great and George sure knows how to work the fryer and make the hot sauce."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Diane H.,"Knoxville, TN",1/22/2018,4.0,"I had to try this place because I love fried chicken.  I had the 2 piece white meal, with potato salad and baked beans.  The chicken is super crispy, which is how I like it.  Very juicy and tender beneath that crust.  The beans were tasty, but not sure if they were homemade.  The potato salad was a let down because it lacked flavor. Seemed to be just potatoes and dressing, and I prefer adding picked and a little onion for flavor. Service was fast, and I was there about 11:30 on a weekday.  Busy place, so it is noisy, but I was there for the chicken and not the ambiance!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tiffany G.,"Powell, TN",4/22/2018,5.0,Oh wow is all I can say!! This is by far the best place to eat. They have the best fried chicken the best okra the best everything all around!! We always get the half chicken with the two sides and a drink because we can't eat all our chicken in one sitting so we take the rest home. It's definitely the best. The prices are great the atmospheres awesome!! We are a military family and they give military discounts but what makes them stand out is the owner comes out and talks to us and thanks my husband for his service!! I recommend this place to everyone!! If I could give 10 stars I definitely would!! My cupboard is full of the cups with their logo on them!!
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Sharon C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/4/2017,4.0,"Our visit to Gus's was my first experience with ""hot"" chicken.  I prefer dark meat, so I got the 2 piece dark snack with a side of greens and two jalapenos.  That was the perfect combination.  Two of my friends got the 2 piece white meat plate, plus we had an appetizer of fried okra.  I really liked the okra, but one of my friends said it had too much breading for his taste, but I liked it.  Everyone liked their white meat selection; however, according to two of them, the tenders were kind of bland.  I am glad I went for the 2 piece dark because it was perfect.  It came out REALLY hot, as in right out of the fryer, so I had my greens while waiting for the chicken to cool down a bit.  The greens were very sweet and I only ate about half of those.  But, the chicken was fantastic.  The outside was nice and crunchy and the inside was really juicy and flavorful.  I liked the spice and heat, too.  I like jalapenos with my fried chicken and the combination did not disappoint.Now, for the downside.  First of all, get rid of all that Styrofoam.  Paper plates can be recycled, but Styrofoam cannot.  There are no condiments (other than some Tabasco) on the table.  If you need salt, pepper, artificial sweetener, etc. you have to ask the server.  The napkins are flimsy so I had to use a lot more than I normally would.  We got there at 2 pm and the place was still full and extremely noisy.  The waiter had a hard time hearing us to get out order.  The worst part though...  every time someone pushed a chair back it resulted in a shrill squeal.  Every time the servers moved a table and all four chairs it was multiple squeals at the same time.  It was deafening.  So, in summary...  loved the food, but bring ear plugs.  Or just eat outside.  That is what I plan on doing the next time."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Katie E.,"Carolina Beach, NC",1/8/2018,5.0,This place is fantastic. Stop reading reviews and go eat the best fried chicken in Knoxville.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Adam S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/8/2016,3.0,"First thing's first- this chicken is delicious. Subtly spiced and incredibly juicy, this bird will give any Nashville hot chicken place a run for its money. Disclaimer: this is not hot chicken, just spicy. Unfortunately, that is where the good stops.The sides are mediocre at best, and cost quite a bit. I would suggest just getting that dank chicken. The reason this place gets three stars is the atrocious service we received the last time we came. Our server forgot our starter of fried okra even after I reminded him. I knew he didn't put our orders in after that because he was talking on his phone visibly in front of us. He brought it out about 25 minutes later alongside our meals after asking us if we got an appetizer. However, he brought my girlfriend the wrong side: OKRA! How do you manage to forget the appetizer, but then bring it out concurrently with a meal with the same thing is beyond me. It gets worse. When my girlfriend told the young man, he took the whole plate away from her and marched to the kitchen, popping a piece of okra from her plate into his mouth. Again, in front of us. He then brings the same plate out unchanged, but with a bowl of the collard greens she ordered in his other hand. We've both been servers before, but that shit was nasty. Five stars for the chickenTwo stars for the sides-2937482618 stars for that server. I'll be back, but for takeout."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jerry M.,"Maryville, TN",8/12/2017,5.0,Best fried chicken I've ever ate. Outstanding sides everything homemade. Reasonable prices. Go hungry you will leave full.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,William J.,"Knoxville, TN",12/1/2017,5.0,Omg I know that is a poor way to start a sentence but sweet Jesus I love this place I love the environment it's so peaceful and southern I live the mild spice to the chicken and the tea is sweet and crisp witch makes it refreshing. I gotta say this is now my new favorite place to eat or at least it is in my top 5. I literally feel like I'm at home I gotta mention the tea again Kim's tea in the store is absolutely delicious places I recommend this place to everyone come to Gus on Sutherland avenue.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,T R.,"Knoxville, TN",10/2/2016,4.0,"Hot spicy chicken..... since ""hot chicken"" is the rage for the moment, we tried Gus's!The chicken was quite delicious!   Not too big on spicy chicken but the skin was perfection.   Reminded me of fried pork skins but was chicken ( weird, I know). I like the worst part !!!! The skin.  The meat was juicy and tender and it was fresh.    My husband and I got a 2 piece, breast and wing and a 3 piece dark.  Sides were ok, Mac & Cheese, baked beans, okra & potato salad.  Okra was not seasoned if at all and the potato salad, although tasty, I wasn't a fan of the cut of the potatoes....didn't appear homemade.  My husband makes an incredible sweet potato pie.   My family has the perfect recipe.   We tried Gus Sweet potato pie & both thought it was way too sweet and too much vanilla flavoring in the mix.  It needed a balance.   With that said, yes it's too loud, but we were there to eat not chat it up so all was good!   We'll be back to eat more hot chicken!!!!!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Daniel T.,"Knoxville, TN",9/29/2017,4.0,The chicken was really good. Although myself and a friend did not find it very spicy or spicy at all. I wish they would offer varying levels.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jim B.,"Columbus, OH",4/10/2017,5.0,"I had never heard of this place until I did a search on Yelp for a spot to eat on a road trip. It was fantastic! Super friendly staff, fast service and the fried chicken was as good as any I've ever had!! I was shocked to find that it is a chain restaurant which 19 locations because it had the feel of an original. I hope to see one near home soon!!! Great job."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Minja P.,"Knoxville, TN",10/18/2016,5.0,"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place out since it opened so tonight we finally got to go. As soon as we walked in the manager greeted us with a smile. Nice little dining area we went outside to sit since the night was so beautiful. We sat for a few minutes and no one came by so we decided to go back inside and the manager saw us and said he will take care of us outside and he was sorry he didn't see us. Bonus points right there and we haven't even gotten our food yet. We both ordered 3 piece chicken plate and I had mac and cheese and fries my husband had mac and cheese and beans. Chicken is served with ranch. I have had some great fried chicken but this place is by far the best chicken I have had! Loved the Cajun spice they use it was delicious! We were going to try dessert any ways and manager took care of it because we waited couple of minutes (which we didn't even care to) he was what every manager of a restaurant should be. Not because he took care of our dessert but he came by multiple times to check on us, you can tell he truly cares about customer service! If you get a chance try pecan pie with ice cream it's amazing!! Love love the service and chicken!  Will be back!!!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Anonymous P.,"Knoxville, TN",10/16/2017,3.0,"This restaurant is definitely a niche filler.  I really can't say anything too bad about the place.  The facilities are clean and the menu is simple.  If you're expecting a standard 'southern fried chicken' fare, this is probably not the place for you.  All of the chicken is spicy, and they do not have barbecue sauce to dip it in.  If you're not in to spicy and / or you like dipping your chicken in sauce that isn't hot, this is likely not the place for you.  They do not have 'non-spicy' chicken options for people who aren't in to that kind of thing (at least as of the last time I visited).  I know a number of people who absolutely love this place, so I can't say it's inherently 'bad'.  It's just not for me."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ada B.,"Knoxville, TN",5/26/2017,5.0,We were so exited to see Gus's in Knoxville. We've been to the Memphis location and loved it. Love this one too.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Robert C.,"White House, TN",10/1/2016,3.0,Service is not great. I do not know how you nearly have a 1-1 staff to customer ratio and can still misplace a 4 piece order. Waited nearly 45 minutes for a to go order until I realized many people had come and gone before me. Poor performance on your part not going to keep customers coming back like that.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Mikale D.,"Newton, NJ",3/9/2017,5.0,"I'm from NJ, and this was my first experience having real southern fried chicken. It was literally every thing I wanted and more. Fried chicken was so so good. But the real success were the sides. I have never had baked beans as good as their's. Wow the baked beans were AMAZING!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Ron J.,"Greenville, SC",2/20/2017,5.0,Went for lunch on Saturday.  Great food.  Fantastic service.  Will definitely be back.
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Jheri V.,"Buffalo Valley, TN",9/9/2016,5.0,"I think that they have fixed up a lot of the issues that other people have complained about in their reviews. All of our sides were excellent: greens, baked beans, mac and cheese! The fried green tomatoes came out piping hot and were very delicious. The fried chicken was crispy, spicy (but not overly spicy - all the flavors could be tasted), juicy, and hot! It was crowded of course and we had to park on the street, but it's well worth it! We can't wait to go back!"
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Sarah S.,"Knoxville, TN",9/6/2016,1.0,"Would have love to have tried it, but when when we got there on Sunday at 5 p.m. they closed because they ran out of chicken. Not a good start."
guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-knoxville,Tim P.,"Knoxville, TN",11/12/2016,4.0,"I really like Gus's. The chicken is awesome, just enough spice for a kick of flavor. It's barely more expensive than fast food, but the taste and quality are much better. I'd definitely recommend the bone-in chicken over the chicken tenders. I also like dining in rather than takeout. Great all around value."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Nicole H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/28/2022,5.0,"After trying to go to another Market Square restaurant that didn't work out we went to Not Watson's. I was hard-core craving a burger and this place did not disappoint. Service was a little slow at the very beginning and after we were done but after getting our drinks and during the meal he was prompt and friendly. After reading all the reviews we tried the Philly cheese steak egg rolls. I'm not going to be the popular opinion on here but they were just ok. Not bad, but DEFINITELY not worth $13 for just 2 full egg rolls.My hubby and I both had burgers. A restaurant in my hometown had this amazing Western burger and I've yet to find anywhere in Knoxville that could get near it but Not Watson's ""Ole Smokey""  is by far the closest thing so far, and almost as good as my hometown favorite. Yay. Finally glad I found something close.My husband had the Parisian and added bacon. I really loved the flavor of his burger. We asked for fries extra crispy and that's exactly what we got. We'll definitely be back to try another burger."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Michele G.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/8/2022,3.0,"I tried this place as it was one of the only 2 with the kitchen open past 9PM on a weekday. Good stuff: Nice people, food was 75% tasty Bad stuff: Wasn't provided special drink menu right away so just ordered an old fashioned. Server came back asking about bourbons but by then I'd realized there was a special drink menu so ordered their ""not so old fashioned"". GROSS. Couldn't drink it. Food - ordered the scallops and the ahi poke. Out of ahi. Switched to strawberry salad. Scallops - AWESOME Strawberry salad - EXCELLENT except for the chicken. It was gross. I ate around it. All in all, it wasn't atrocious but I wouldn't bother giving them another shot."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,John O.,"Lincoln, RI",7/11/2022,4.0,"What makes this dinner a  4 star is definitely the staff! Shout out to Kyle at the bar! He hustled the entire time I was there. Friendly and knowledgeable! Had the shrimp poboy. Shrimp fired and seasoned perfect! But the kicker on a po boy has a lot to do with the roll! Bad roll, bad po boy no matter how good the shrimp is ! Great roll! Nice greens and the spicy sauce was great(I ordered extra)"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Wendy B.,"Memphis, TN",6/15/2022,5.0,"If you really want to experience joie de vivre in Knoxville, go to Not Watsons on a gorgeous spring evening, have a glass of Malbec, take in the sounds of the local musicians playing happily in the square, and enjoy a mouthwatering Chimichurri flat iron steak to satisfy your soul. The steak is beautifully cooked and adorned with a perfect harmony of  blended cilantro and garlic that is more savory than pungent. This lovingness was so delicious I considered asking for an extra side to bring home with me. I now believe the true purpose of potatoes is to exist in this cheddar mash! And the broccolini was Al denté and perfectly seasoned. The service was exceptional- I often dine alone and servers can sometimes hurry the meal out, but there was no rush or excessive waiting. Everything arrived in perfect time. Highly recommended."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christina C.,"Roseville, CA",7/7/2022,5.0,"Wow! We (7) of us had dinner and drinks on 7/6/2022 and will definitely go back. First, I had signed up to join the waitlist and 30 minutes later I got a text that said the waitlist closed and I didn't have a spot. I was confused. I called the restaurant and told them what happened and they added my group back to the waitlist no questions asked and apologized for the technical error. I was very grateful since there were 7 of us and we were celebrating! We arrived and immediately I was drawn to the ambience.  I love the full bar and the entire restaurant was clean and looked great. Our waiter was amazing! He was very interactive and made sure are drinks and food was up to our standards. I ordered the chicken strawberry salad and it was Amazing! I know it's a salad but the pecans, fresh lettuce, poppyseed dressing and fried goat cheese was beyond flavorful. I think they seasoned and glazed the pecans! The grilled chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Hubby had a burger and fries! He ate it all and it was cooked to his liking (no red at all) Kids- mash potatoes (I tasted and ended up taking 3 bites) so good Mac and cheese- this item took me by surprise, it was very cheesy but they also seasoned it with idk but it was very very good Brussels sprouts- perfectly roasted and simply seasoned very delicious Grilled cheese and fries, not one bit left the sandwich perfectly grilled and when you pulled it apart you seen the cheese!!! Adult - 9th street Philly and it was very flavorful and again not one bite left on his plate Adult- Asian chicken salad ""quote"" this is so good will order it when I'm at work since I can walk here. Drinks- Lynchburg lemonade everyone loved those not too bitter or sweet just perfect. 2 summer time sidecars- this was my drink and it was very strong and good not bad strong like oh ya that's it baby! Definitely will return."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Stephen L.,"Nashville, TN",5/28/2022,5.0,Our waiter was awesome ! The vibe in here was cool. The Philly cheese steak egg rolls were great ! Wings too. My Buffalo chicken sandwich was awesome. The burger was just okay. Not bad. Not great. The food came quick and the bathrooms were very clean. Cocktails were good. The Bloody Mary was good enough. This place still gets 5 stars because we all left with a good vibe. The location is $$ too. Go Bucs !
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Brooke H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/5/2022,5.0,"My party of four adults tried Not Watson's for the first time yesterday after a matinee at the Tennessee Theater.  We were seated immediately at a booth near the back and ordered cocktails while we studied the menu. Our server was great: knowledgeable about the menu, prompt, and friendly.  All our food was delicious.  I had the steak with chimichurri, and it was extremely flavorful.  The rest of my group enjoyed their burgers and pasta dishes.  Highly recommend for a quality meal in a relaxed atmosphere."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Greg M.,"Strongsville, OH",1/26/2022,5.0,"Outstanding.  Simply outstanding.  Totally surprised.  The menu was like one you would get at Denny's.  Ordered the Chimichura Steak, as I've made the same at home and wanted to see how the pros did it.  Boy did I find out. First of all, I asked for medium rare, and got medium rare.  A rarity if you will!  Usually way overcooked.  Secondly, the mashed cheddar spuds were outstanding.  Could taste and feel the solid taters in the mash, unbelievably good.  And the broccolini could not have been better!  Would have been nice to have a salad and bread, but heh, for the price, this was outstanding.  Bartender was cordial and quick.  Nothing at all to bitch about.  Also figured out why this is call NOT Watson's kitchen.  Great place all around!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Nick R.,"Nashville, TN",5/9/2022,4.0,The food was really good!  We came here before a basketball game in December and service was great and food was delicious.  No complaints.

The turkey burger was delicious, with sweet potato fries!  My hubby had the meatloaf dinner and did not disappoint!  My daughter had the buffalo chicken sandwich and love it!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ashley M.,"Knoxville, TN",4/2/2022,5.0,Came in after strolling along at chalk walk and decided to grab a bite. Hostess not friendly. However the food was fantastic! Great drinks as well!! Really do enjoy this place!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ashley M.,"Knoxville, TN",2/3/2022,4.0,"So when we arrived the hostess said nothing. We had to say we have 2 in our party and was seated quickly. We were given menus and she still said nothing. However, our waitress was wonderful. Very sweet attentive and made great recommendations. Food was excellent! We really enjoyed ourselves. I would go back and hope for a better hostess! The service and food quality saved this review! Mimosa, Poke Tuna, Meatloaf, Cajun Pasta"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sarah H.,"SC, SC",8/11/2022,4.0,The food was typical American style food. The inside has a bit of a sports bar vibe especially on the weekends. It's gets a bit crowded but the service is good. One interesting thing they had there was a flight of tequila shots.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Terese J.,"Birmingham, AL",2/19/2022,4.0,"Oh we had the most amazing luck on this spot the wait list was two hours. however when we walked in, we was seated quickly due to small party.We also lucked up with an beautiful waiter with a beautiful smile. She suggest some great burgers and sandwiches. I had the strawberita drink which was eat the ice and fresh strawberries good. Hubs had wish he gotten the old fashion cause he was not thrill with the honey badger, watered down a little.He was over the moon happy with his porkchop sandwich and I was definitely taking the rest of my burger to go .

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Anthony N.,"Greensboro, NC",7/3/2021,5.0,"My wife and I regularly return to this great restaurant in Knoxville. The atmosphere is great, the beer/spirit selection is awesome and the food is fantastic. I've had the mahi-mahi a couple of times, and it's delicious. It's a perfectly pan-grilled slice of blackened mahi-mahi, tender and flaky, with delicious sides of smashed potatoes, braised kale salad and garnished with tomato beurre blanc. The fried green tomatoes are the best I've had anywhere thus far, topped with creamy pimiento cheese. The chimichurri flat-iron steak medium rare is also another epic plate. If you can't decide on a bourbon or tequila selection, they serve convenient flights so you can sample all the best.If you're in DT Knoxville, Not Watsons is a place you will not want to miss."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ken R.,"Maryville, TN",8/15/2022,1.0,"Stopped in for a quick dinner before a concert at the Tennessee Theater and ordered the meatloaf, after the first bite I noticed it tasted burnt but looking at the 1/4 thick slices they didn't appear to be burnt so I removed the top layer and turned over the bottom layer and found all the burnt pieces. They tried hiding them by putting them burnt side down on a pile of mashed potatoes. This used to be my go to place for dinner before a show but not anymore."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Deidre T.,"Fort Worth, TX",5/17/2022,5.0,"Holy smokes - their salmon, mashed potatoes, and asparagus was LIT !!!! My husband and I both were commenting after every bite. It was that good. Salmon was cooked perfectly with a slight crisp on the outside, but not dry inside. The couple next to us commented to each other how ""perfect"" their food was cooked, too. We enjoyed sitting on the patio, as we were tourists to the area. We will definitely visit if we're ever in the Knoxville area again."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Thuy Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",1/9/2022,3.0,"Went for a little lunch meeting because they had some outdoor seating. It wasn't too busy and we didn't have to wait for a table.The menu had some good variety, something for everyone. I ended up with the kale Caesar, which I'd say was alright. It didn't blow me away and it was actually a pretty small portion for an entree salad. My dining companions got salad and a burger as well and enjoyed them, but they weren't super memorable. We know how service can be with staffing so I won't hold that against anyone, but it took us about 15 minutes of waiting before we were able to get water and another 10-15 minutes to see our server again so we could order. They're doing their best though!I'd say it's not a bad choice for a bite and is probably go again to try some other things on the menu (fries looked really good!) but I won't wait for a table."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ginger L.,"Tampa Bay, FL",12/1/2021,3.0,"This is a Vol's fan favorite. Maybe since I am not a Vol's fan I don't quite ~get it~ but this was totally mediocre. The menu is huuuuuuge and so it's great for large groups who can't decide what they want. And there are nearly enough TVs for each table to have it's own (that is an exaggeration). They offer mimosa deals on the weekends along with a brunch menu and have a full bar. Everything is orange. I think the food itself and the service is where I got lost. My order wasn't correct, and if my server had been more accessible I probably would have asked him to correct it. Since he was so swamped it didn't seem worth it. I enjoyed the veggie burger and the tots were pretty good too. The Philly cheese omelet was super disappointing and I would not recommend. I think that for what this is - a local hangout - it's great. If you're just looking for a good bite to eat, I would pass."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Melissa G.,"Charleston, SC",5/30/2021,5.0,"We were looking at menus around market square and ""not Watson's kitchen"" stood out as having the best options and variety for us. We were sat promptly on the patio and we didn't have to wait at all. The patio sitting faces the square so it is great for  people watching and to absorb the Knoxville vibe. For food I ordered the strawberry salad with chicken which was really really good and the fried goat cheese was amazing. I did think they the lettuce base was a small portion and left me wanting more greens and crunch .My companion ordered the ahi tuna sandwich on gluten free bread and it was outstanding. The fish portion was perfect and the sauce brought the dish together. The fries were also excellent. Great choice for lunch or dinner !"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tim O.,"Chicago, IL",4/30/2022,5.0,"The cuisine here is so far beyond bar food that they are almost doing themselves a disservice by having ""bar"" in the name.

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ana S.,"Tucson, AZ",2/12/2022,5.0,"My husband and I went tonight for our Valentine's date night since I'll have to work that night. We decided to go back here because last time we went it was really good. Last time we had the chicken and waffles with watermelon on the side. That was a great dish also. We've been wanting that watermelon since then, so we asked to substitute one of our sides tonight for it.We had the skirt steak with broccolini and mashed potatoes. Neither of those sides disappoint but we sure are happy that we got the watermelon. It was a perfect compliment to the spiciness of the steak. It helped to cool the pallet."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Bryan A.,"Voluntown, CT",6/28/2022,4.0,"I ordered the scallop appetizer and it was amazing. Great service, food came out quickly. Overall a good atmosphere. My reason for the four stars and not five is because my entrée of the flat iron steak was like beef jerky. It was supposed to come with chimichurry sauce and there was only a smudged smear on top of the steak. Flat irons are usually well marbled and tender. This was like chewing beef flavored rubber, my jaw literally told me to quit eating it. I also had the flash fried Brussels that were cooked well but had no seasoning, and broccolini. Best part of the meal was a great staff and the scallops. I might come back...."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Noelle A.,"Woodstock, GA",4/2/2022,5.0,"WOW!  The atmosphere was great and the food even better.  We were referred by our Uber driver and he did well!  Hands down one of the best burgers we have had.  The fries were on point and perfectly cooked!Music was great, service spectacular and quaint atmosphere.  Go!  You won't be sorry!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,S L.,"Nashville, TN",4/20/2022,5.0,"Our hotel was close to market square & we wandered in here for dinner on our walk around market square! It wasn't busy on a Friday night & we walked right in! Our server was great & had great recommendations! The strawberry margarita was awesome! (But let's please serve real straws not paper straws with alcohol...the paper straw is worthless w a strawberry purée margarita!). I ordered the chimichurri steak. It was excellent & cooked perfectly, but it really needed way more chimichurri on it! The steak was good but there was very little to no actual chimichurri on it! The mashed potatoes were to die for! My husband ordered the meatloaf sandwich & it has to be the best thing on the menu! It was so good I wish I would've ordered it! The bread was perfectly toasted & the flavor of the meatloaf was phenomenal! The appetizer of the Philly eggs rolls was great too., but beware it's a tad spicy! We didn't try dessert but their options of key lime pie & banana pudding sounded wonderful! Overall we enjoyed our meal & will come back here for that meatloaf sandwich text time we're in Knoxville!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jeff K.,"Danville, CA",8/23/2021,5.0,"Made a spontaneous trip to Knoxville, where we had time for one meal in the area. Glad we chose Not Watson's. Located right in the middle of market square, one might expect the food to be overpriced and overhyped, but it was evidently the opposite. We started off with the fried green tomatoes. These are topped with sweet jam, pimento, and some country ham. I've had fried green tomatoes before but the toppings took this dish to a whole new level. Loved it. The strawberry salad was refreshing and we'll portioned. The chicken was seasoned well and had some Cajun flavoring to it. Fried goat cheese is the real filler for this dish - they place it on the side in case you don't like goat cheese. Creole pasta with shrimp and alligator was a great finisher. The sauce is creamy and rich in flavor. The shrimp and alligator are cooked well and tie everything in the dish together. Fantastic service and very well air-conditioned interior."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kathy R.,"Tampa Bay, FL",3/17/2022,5.0,"Loved our lunch memory here. Friendly staff, calamari with the special sauce - sooo good! Lightly bettered. We had the burger and fries! Great price and fun atmosphere!"

Everything in the menu looks spectacular, but was in the mood for a fresh salad. The house salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing was absolutely wonderful, fresh spring mix, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, candied pecans and feta. I cleaned my plate, which is rare for me. 5 star fresh ingredients, 5 star service. Fantastic lunch or dinner spot!!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Raven T.,"Baltimore, MD",1/11/2022,4.0,"We waited what felt like an eternity to be seated because we didn't have a reservation, but this place was absolutely delicious. I ordered the meat loaf and to this day I dream about it. It was perfectly seasoned and wrapped in bacon. Need i say more? And the potatoes, creamy and cheesy, just so good mmm. I was starving so im pretty sure I don't have a photo, but trust a girl who literally NEVER orders meatloaf and get the meatloaf!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Martin H.,"Raleigh, NC",7/2/2021,5.0,Lunch.  Friday afternoon.  Outside.  Nice breeze.  Nice selection of craft beers.  Extensive menu.  Great choices.  Well cooked food.  Friendly and attentive service.  Best deal on the menu?  $12 for the ahi tuna sandwich with fries.  Crazy good.  Second time here and will be back.  Recommended
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Dylan S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/12/2020,4.0,"Great menu with a variety of burgers, salads, and entree dishes.  The salads are fresh and well balanced, the burgers are always delicious, and most of the entrees are worthy of 4-5 stars.  The chicken and waffles and creole pasta are great entrees which I would go back for.  If your in the mood for a salad you can't go wrong with the  steak kale caesar, Cobb, or strawberry chicken salads.  Appetizer wise, I am a big big fan of the Tuna Poke appetizer. If you like tuna you will LOVE it.  Also the tater tots are legit.  I would skip the meatloaf entree as it can be pretty dry, also the ribeye is a little sad for the price.... all in all a solid lunch or dinner choice in the market.For brunch we recently tried the market Bennie which was good, but came off a little dry due to them serving it on one of their biscuits rather than the English muffin as advertised on the menu."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mirko P.,"Nashville, TN",5/10/2021,4.0,"Pretty nice place. Lucky to be able to seat outside, after several days in row having rain. Having Monday deal 1/2 price on bottle of wine make you feel excited. Creole pasta was delicious and fish and chips would be also that didn't served with lukewarm chips. Complimented with Starborough Sauvignon Blanc fit very well. Service was excellent. Server was from Scotland and was a joy to exchange some international experience."

The service was terrific and I loved the neighborhood vibe. A friend recommended this to us to check out while visiting the University of Tennessee. We were not disappointed. The food was really terrific and since we wanted to watch some sports, there were plenty of TV's to take in the action. We liked every single thing we ordered from the tuna appetizer (I think it was called poke) to the drinks, steak chimichurri, and fish and chips. Even the coleslaw was well made and not too heavy."

Mr. Cody came to the window and when I told him what happened he said ""really"" with a smirk on his face. I was like, ""Yes"" then he went on to say, ""Oh,"" but the smirk was still on his face. He was questioning the fact of if I really got burned. When I asked for my money back he got an attitude. He refuse to tell me the general manager's name or number."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Cory B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/22/2021,5.0,"I already loved this places dinner, but decided to finally try brunch.  First we started with the fried pickles as I already loved then, and I wanted my wife to try them.  As always amazing and not disappointed.   I ordered the pimento cheese and bacon omelet.  It was a very good omelet with tasty pimento cheese, and the tomato jam was a very nice additional touch as it paired well with the pimento cheese and bacon.  Their tater tots are some of the best that I have ever had.  I tried my wife's Bennie which was full of flavor and it was a great choice too.  I also got to try my friends chicken and biscuits which was my favorite dish of the tree.  Really good fried chicken on a made from scratch biscuit and gravy, then add spicy honey and you have a great flavor explosion.  We also got a pitcher of mimosas to split, which for $15 was a great price as we both had 3 drinks each from it.  The staff as always was amazing and very accommodating.  This place remains one of my favorite Knoxville restaurants.  We will be back for sure"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jon G.,"Cleveland, TN",3/19/2022,5.0,Best food in Knoxville in my opinion.   Fried pickles are ridiculously good and the burgers are amazing.   Decent prices too.

Great scenery and people watching. The southern fried pickles are a good starter. For me, it's all about the burgers at Not Watson's. They have several options to choose from and you can't go wrong. I love the ultimate bacon cheeseburger. Order that with a side of sweet potato fries. If you have kiddos, there are multiple options. My kids like the chicken tenders."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ginger L.,"Tampa Bay, FL",12/1/2021,3.0,"This is a Vol's fan favorite. Maybe since I am not a Vol's fan I don't quite ~get it~ but this was totally mediocre. The menu is huuuuuuge and so it's great for large groups who can't decide what they want. And there are nearly enough TVs for each table to have it's own (that is an exaggeration). They offer mimosa deals on the weekends along with a brunch menu and have a full bar. Everything is orange. I think the food itself and the service is where I got lost. My order wasn't correct, and if my server had been more accessible I probably would have asked him to correct it. Since he was so swamped it didn't seem worth it. I enjoyed the veggie burger and the tots were pretty good too. The Philly cheese omelet was super disappointing and I would not recommend. I think that for what this is - a local hangout - it's great. If you're just looking for a good bite to eat, I would pass."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Gail M.,"LaFollette, TN",11/20/2021,4.0,I would have given GREAT! However my favorite is the fish and chips and depending on what day you go the size varies. The first time I got it they served nice large pieces of fish. The second time it looked like an appetizer plate. I asked the waiter if there was a mistake in the order because it was not the same serving side I had previously received there. He did bring another couple of very small pieces later. Again even with the extra fish that did it was not worth the money. So please try to be more consistent. The food is amazing when you give a whole serving!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sarah S.,"Radford, VA",11/18/2021,5.0,"Experience could not have been better. Our server Tuck was the most easy going and enjoyable individual, he made our night.

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Olivia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/29/2020,3.0,"Decent food here, we had the fried pickle spears, which had intense pickle flavor (which was tasty but it overwhelmed the battering flavor), fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles and creole pasta. The chicken and waffles were alright, mediocre all around, and there were cheese in the waffles - interesting touch! But the cheese flavor was totally lost by even a dot of maple syrup. The fried chicken was standard, nothing outstanding. Green tomatoes came with this incredible sauce/chutney/jam type thing which was delicious and totally made the dish. The white cheddar Mac was weird...it had thyme and bacon in it which was super overwhelming flavor-wise, would not recommend. The creole pasta was tasty, 4/5."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Dleeuss 1.,"VA, VA",6/14/2022,5.0,"Great food: we both got the scallops, which were cooked well, although a bit salty and sour; the pasta that came with was tasty and seasoned well with a touch of cheese.

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Gary J.,"Irvine, CA",6/9/2022,3.0,Driving across the country we stopped into Knot Watson's and had dinner.  The atmosphere was very casual and friendly.  We were seated quickly and drinks taken soon after.  My wife had a salad and I the fish and chips.  Our waiter was a young man with a great smile and friendly demenor.  The salad was average and my fish and chips were small and unimpressive.  The place most likely leans toward the drinking aspect and food is an afterthought.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Brian V.,"Weddington, NC",10/21/2020,4.0,"Walked into Market Square Knoxville with a mission to find a good tasting meal that was not overbearing.  I just finished a 6 mile run just before venturing out so I did not want to pack back on the calories I just sweated off and at the same time I wanted a meal that would be satisfying.  I found this place with a rather strange name- ""Not Watson Kitchen + Bar.  I'm sure there's a story there somewhere.  Anyway,  the wait was short and the end of the bar was nearly empty as compared to the patio and inside tables so I parked my rear there and ordered a drink-  NC Bold Rock Cider. Several actually.  Before I ordered my first the young bartender carded me.  Now I turn 44 in 2 days so I found this amusing much more than he did.  Me and another guy started laughing because he didn't get carded at which time the bartender bowed up and told a story about not carding someone with a cop in at the bar and he lost his job over it.  Yikes!!  Didn't mean to push a button over it.  Anyway in an effort to choose a meal (and change the subject)  I asked him what he recommended off the menu.  I said the reviews seem to suggest the flat iron steak.  At which time he told me ""I think Yelpers are a bunch of BS."" Moody and opinionated about me and my fellow Yelpers.  Strike 2!!Per my fellow Yelpers I ordered the chimichurri flat iron steak with cheddar mashed taters and substituted the broccolini for grill asparagus.  I also added a salad that had candied nuts, vinaigrette dressing, cukes and matos.  Good choice on both Items.After the ""rough"" start with me and the bartender this was an epic save of a review.  That flat iron steak was cooked perfected and the grilled asparagus was plentiful and crunchy and the mash was heavenly.   The chimichurri on the steak added a bit of a kick to the meal for sure.  No photo but I again was a proud member of the clean plate club tonight.  Sit on the patio and enjoy hospitable service and a delightful meal.  This place will be on my Knoxville collection with a note about being patience while waiting for a table. Thanks!  Please vote."

I had the philly and egg meal with tater tots for brunch and WOW I was so impressed. The sandwich itself is so tender and delicious while the tater tots were perfectly crispy like how to should be. I was with a group of 6 friends and we were promptly seated outside on a Saturday around 11am. would definitely recommended here for brunch.I came here for dinner once and was kind of disappointed. the music is played extremely loud to the point I couldn't hear the person next to me so I don't recommend coming here if you wanna talk to people. As for the meal, I got the Parisian burger. the brie cheese and mushrooms were a very nice touch to the burger. the first few bites were delicious but as I was eating the burger, I noticed that the patty itself was a bit dry and bland. the fries that came with it were also kinda salty. overall I would come here for brunch again but can't say the same for dinner."

It is nice to see everyone in upbeat moods even though business is slow these days.Our food came out nice and hot. Everyone enjoyed their meal. We were celebrating my husbands birthday.

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Stephanie B.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",7/27/2019,5.0,"Not Watson's Kitchen and Bar was an excellent choice for our one night in lovely Knoxville, Tennessee.  The long and skinny restaurant with a small patio and a full bar is a great choice for families, friends or the romantically inclined.  The casual restaurant is chic and has plenty to look at, but the lights are not too bright and conversations can be heard.The service is very good, including management that has attention to detail.  Our server was practically timid, but he was hospitable and kept us very happy.The bourbon selection is impressive.  I recommend ordering a flight.  While the cocktails are solid (took a sip of Manhattan), the ability to taste bourbons, ryes and more side by side are much more impressive.The food is basically best in class.  They have these incredible fried green tomatoes topped with a bit of pimento cheese and diced ham that blew my mind.  Crunchy and sweet with creamy and salty made for a symphony in my mouth.  The fried Brussels sprouts were also impressive.  While a classic, they were caramelized and crunchy - perfectly prepared.  DD had an excellent wedge salad, with a generous amount of blue cheese and bacon.  It was good blue cheese - soft, salty and lots of blue veins.  It wasn't those garbage sawdust crumbles.Dinner was fantastic.  DD loved his creole pasta, and I was impressed by the creamy sauce with just the right amount of heat.  One LO had a classic grilled cheese, while the other dug the crunchy, fresh and moist fried chicken made in house.  DM and I were happy to be sharing two salads.  We had a well made rare, grilled salmon over spinach salad in a zippy vinaigrette with tomatoes and onions as well as bacon and hardboiled eggs.  We also had an excellent flatiron kale Caesar with very tender and perfectly dressed greens under tender, rare flank steak.  Both the housemade Caesar and the warm-bacon mustard vinaigrette were excellent.We all ordered well, but DH ordered best when he got the pork chop porterhouse.  The bone in pork was so moist and tender, even though I initially thought it was cooked more than it should be.  It wasn't - it's light pink interior was juicy perfection.  Just as impressive, it was served in a bed of creamy and perfectly al dente mushroom risotto with braised baby arugula.  I nearly get a tear in my eye thinking of the fact that some of the best risotto that I have ever had was a side dish for a pork chop!  It was a star on its own.  The perfectly prepared arugula was verdant and peppery.There were not many choices for dessert, but the whiskey bundt cake is a must ordered if it on the menu.  The mini-bundt butter cake is topped with crunchy, caramely nuts and dusted with powdered sugar before being drizzled with a rich and nutty bourbon butter sauce.  It is rich and wonderful - perfect for sharing.I know that the proprietors were always hoping that they could skip Watson's, but there is no way that your family will say ""Not Watson's"" after coming to this brilliant restaurant.  I would say, ""do we get to go to Watson's?  HURRAH!"""

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jan A.,"Rockford, TN",2/28/2021,5.0,I had the black bean wrap and it was so good!  Sat outside on the patio.  Got a pineapple mimosa that was poured well!  Would definitely go back!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Karen A.,"Orlando, FL",8/7/2021,5.0,"After being blown off at Tupelo Honey we decided to try this place for lunch and were so glad we did!  Food was delicious and the server and all of the staff were friendly and attentive. I got salmon instead of the trout on one of their salads and it was so good!  Highly recommend, especially if you want good service!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",1/8/2021,2.0,"Tried this place for the first time the other day. We ordered a wedge salad and a market cheeseburger to go. My husband brought it home and there was no dressing for the salad (balsamic glaze and bleu cheese dressing both missing) and they had given us a nasty chili mac burger instead of the standard cheeseburger we ordered. I don't know what kind of monster orders a burger with macaroni and chili on it, but they can have this place all to themselves."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sarah S.,"Radford, VA",11/18/2021,5.0,"Experience could not have been better. Our server Tuck was the most easy going and enjoyable individual, he made our night. The food was fantastic - from the philly cheese steak egg rolls to the creme brûlée , spicy bloodys and an absolutely wonderful chimi churri steak. Looking forward to going back."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Dennis L.,"Long Grove, IL",8/10/2020,5.0,"We used Yelp's reservation system to get a table - it was very pleasant with real-time updates and no aggravation.The restaurant uses distancing and masks, making it comforting during the COVID situation.It was full and we did have to wait a while; however, the ambiance, couple of drinks, and the attentiveness of our server alleviated the strains of the fatigue.The chicken and waffles was flavorful, the custom made portobello mushroom veggie wrap moist and delicious, the tuna tartare flavorful and light. The pork belly tacos were somewhat dry to my taste; however, another member of our party though they were delicious. Nevertheless, I would recommend cutting the pork thicker so that the pieces remain soft and moist.Overall, the ease of reservation, ambiance, the attentive service, and the flavor profile as well as the execution on the dishes left us wanting to come back."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Taryn M.,"Newnan, GA",3/8/2021,5.0,"Great food selection! A lot of the menu items stood out to us as a yummy option, but we ended up ordering the pork belly taco appetizer, flatiron kale caesar salad and chicken & waffles. Everything was delicious and well prepared. Outdoor seating was great since we had our dog with us too."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kevin H.,"Chattanooga, TN",7/5/2021,2.0,"Love the restaurant, love their food, love the in person service. However, the take out/togo service is subpar. The restaurant's phones rarely work properly, making it nearly impossible to make a takeout order. In the age of COVID, that is unacceptable for the customer and you would think the business as well. I have not taken this lightly to write a new review but it's the fact that this issue occurs about 85+% of the time when we try to make a takeout order. This typically results in a call to the neighboring restaurant (which is the same company/management) to get them to open the phone lines to Not Watson's. An easy solution to this if after at least a year of this issue, would be to have a mobile ordering website if the phone lines are continually too difficult to manage."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mike W.,"Linden, NJ",12/30/2019,4.0,"We stopped in for lunch here after a morning of exploring downtown Knoxville. There is a plethora of restaurant choices around this place, but this one caught our eye. Nice outdoor seating area when the weather is warm enough to be outside. I kinda wish I had come here a little later in the day when I was in the mood for beer, since they did have some interesting choices. But alas, I was thirsty after having walked around for the past few hours, so I was the cheap date and got water. Some good food choices here, I got the buffalo chicken sandwich which was a little messy as any good buffalo sandwich should be, which came with fresh cut French fries- though not a fan of the fake fryer baskets they were served in. Too many restaurants are doing that these days."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jessica B.,"Parkersburg, WV",3/5/2022,5.0,"This was our first time in Knoxville, and No Watson's was great! The fried pickles were amazing with a spicy dipping sauce. If you love brussels sprouts... This is your place! They were delicious along with the chimichurri flat iron steak! Definitely worth a visit!"

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Donald W.,"Knoxville, TN",12/22/2020,5.0,Consistency in food flavor as well as service. The restaurant has excellent flat iron steak. Meat loaf. Salmon. And love the turkey burgers with sweet potato fries. The waiters and servers. Trevor. Kyle. Ricky. Tylo. Chris Hannah. And so many others are like my new family. Used to come here once per week now 3 times. The managers. Bo and Irving are friendly and check on All customers

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Brant K.,"Sterling, VA",2/8/2022,5.0,"This is my favorite Knoxville restaurant when I'm in town visiting. The food is consistently great, service is friendly and attentive. The biggest problem you have when you come here is deciding which of their fantastic dishes to order!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Angie H.,"Knoxville, TN",12/28/2019,4.0,Updated review: this time was much better. We split the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls -they were fantastic. Would definitely get them again. I think our server made the difference. Washington was attentive without being in the way. It is still loud -but that is because of the high ceiling. The food was very good. I had the chili Mac n cheese burger. Good but difficult to eat without wearing it. The fish and chips are very mild fish with a great crispy coating.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Angie H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/23/2019,3.0,Been several times and the only thing that stands out is the loudness inside the restaurant. The last time is the only time my food was correct and warm. Our server was not ready to be in her own. She had another server come and tell us their computers went down and our order was lost- and they still got our drinks wrong. Nothing has bee so horrible as to bash this place- but I really don't think I need to go back.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lois C.,"Portland, OR",12/2/2019,3.0,"We were a party of 8, and pretty much everyone agreed their meals were on the just ok side of good.  No one raved about their meal.  My wedge salad seemed a bit under-dressed.  My husband's cobb was just ok.  We shared the Philly Cheesesteak Egg Rolls, which were the highlight of the meal.  I would recommend those for sure.  Three of us had fish & chips & said they were ""decent"".  The rest had burgers & said they were fine.  Service was good, waters we're kept full by a bottle they provide for us to fill ourselves, but they did refill the bottle in a timely manner both times it was needed.  The table also had fried pickle spears & commented that those were good & the dip spicy.I expected more given the ratings, but have sort of figured out that folks in TN seem to rate things higher than I would in a lot of cases."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,John H.,"Charlotte, NC",11/13/2018,4.0,"Great spot in Market Square.Visited on a Sunday night around 6:00 on a holiday weekend and was seated right away. Appears to appeal to a broad crowd as there were people of all ages including multiple tables with small children.Cool story on the naming of the place on the menu. Pretty funny.  Large selection of draft beer (Wicked Weed Pernicious IPA @ $5.50) as well as a pretty large menu overall.  We decided to order Crispy Brussels Sprouts as an appetizer even though they are listed under sides.   Unfortunately, they were out so we were unable to try them.My bride went with the Market Cheeseburger ($10) and said it was fine.   I went with the Grilled Salmon ($17) and it was excellent - and really enjoyed the sides. It was well prepared.Service from Garvin and the team was attentive and prompt.Would absolutely go back again."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mike U.,"Boynton Beach, FL",1/13/2020,5.0,Good food & service in Market Square. I had the allegator po boy and my wife had the An-Seared Scallops (Pan Seared Scallops Over Bacon Cheddar Grit Cakes With Braised Greens  + Roasted Red Pepper Sauce). Enjoyed the casual atmosphere!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Scott L.,"Slidell, LA",10/12/2019,5.0,Came to town for the Tennessee-Miss State game and this place had the most reviews with the highest rating so - that's where we went! Overall a great experience. About an hour wait because of the large crowds but they managed that well. They have a nice selection of spirits and craft beers so we enjoyed that while we waited. Our server - Claire - did a great job with an over-taxed kitchen. I had the ribeye with grilled asparagus and fried red potatoes. Others had the salmon and pasta. All got great comments. I have to say my ribeye was tasty and not trimmed well - very fatty in places. But on the whole it was good. All up it was a good app and I would certainly go back if I was back in town!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christie M.,"NY, NY",2/1/2022,5.0,"Delicious burgers, great beer and excellent service! If you're trying to decide where to eat, look no further!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Vanezza U.,"TN, TN",1/21/2022,1.0,The restaurant smells bad in the restroom area. The hostess was rude.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tamara D.,"Fountain City, Knoxville, TN",1/17/2021,5.0,"We went to Not Watson's to celebrate joint birthdays. The wait was about 30 minutes for a party of 6 on a Saturday night at 7pm. We got Tuna Poke, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, fried green tomatoes, seared scallops, on fried bacon cheese grits, and calamari. Everything was amazing! Chicken and waffles, Cobb salad, and ribeye were also ordered. Large portions and the sweet tea is awesome. Large variety of wine and spirits also. Serve is spot on and lots of COVID precautions were visible as well."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mike K.,"Sunbury, OH",9/28/2019,4.0,Not Watson's is a cool place on market square to eat. I had the flat iron steak and I really enjoyed it. It was prepared just right - tasted delicious the potatoes were awesome.  Service was good. This place is worth a visit.  My only criticism is that the plate was too big for the food so you thought you should get more but the portions were the right sized.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lauren S.,"Easley, SC",7/12/2021,4.0,"Had a Togo order. Greeted immediately.  Good food and had a nice environment.  Very busy, but the staff seemed to handle it well."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jisha M.,"Cincinnati, OH",10/31/2018,5.0,They do American food and they do it sooo well!Had brunch at the bar last Saturday; a booth would have required a extra 15-20 minutes so we decided to forgo the wait. We ordered from the minimal brunch menu; could have ordered from their regular menu as well. I chose the honey fried chicken biscuit with sausage gravy and my husband had their take on a Philly cheesesteak with a side of tots.It was fantastic! The perfect brunch addition to any rotation. The honey friend chicken was perfectly seasoned; the right balance of sweet heat.  Food and drinks came out quickly and service was friendly; we got a lot of attention even though we were seated at the bar. Can't wait to go back!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christina D.,"Columbus, OH",7/20/2018,5.0,This place is adorable. Also the food is amazing. And the drinks have actual booze in them. You should go eat here.No seriously. Pork belly tacos. Try them.And the staff there is lovely and have figured out just the right balance between making sure you have everything you need and not bugging you every time you take a bite. I like that :-)
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Allen A.,"Libertyville, IL",8/4/2019,5.0,What a great restaurant.  We ate here in a party of 7 and they were great.   The food was fantastic and the location good too.  Here are a few tips: - they don't take reservations but they will put you on the wait list 1 hour ahead.   So if you want a 6pm reservation then call your name in at 5pm and you probably won't have to wait.  - eating there on the first Friday of the month guarantees you get a ton of shopping in too.  The night we went there was a play going on in the square and the shops had specials going.  - I got the steak and it was good.  I heard the burgers were good too.  Nice beer selection - Wicked Weed IPA is always a good choice.  We really liked this place.  Family friendly too.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Steven I.,"Chicago, IL",9/12/2020,3.0,The service at the bar was great. Zero complaints. The fried green tomatoes were super different. There was more cheese than tomato. I wouldn't recommend or order them again. I had a beer flight with bar tenders choice. Flight was great.  I then had the chicken and waffles. I was disappointed because that was the signature dish. The chicken was bland and the waffles were cold. Not sure if the waffles and chicken were pre made ? But I had to check to see if the waffle were stale. It wasn't 12 hours old but it wasn't fresh. The watermelon was great with the dish but it's decent BAR FOOD. I wouldn't call this place fine dining by any means. Don't expect more than that from what I ordered. I would return but would not reorder anything I ordered.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Julian T.,"Danville, VA",9/14/2020,3.0,Food was stellar. By far the best meatloaf I have ever had. We also had the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese. The server was impatient with our group. The place stinks when you walk in. Smells like dirty mop water.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Arthur B.,"Farmington, MI",6/11/2021,5.0,"Stopped for a light lunch.We split a Wedge Salad and an order of Black and Blue Sliders.Wedge was lovely.Sliders were amazing, beyond delightful.Highly recommend!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Payton F.,"Knoxville, TN",12/7/2021,5.0,I love not watsons! I've been here maybe 3 times and it's great! The Buffalo chicken sandwich is so good and the fried pickles are too!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Donta W.,"San Antonio, TX",9/10/2020,5.0,"I cannot lie I was not expecting that flavorful of a Chimichurri flat iron steak at an American sports bar type restaurant in Knoxville, TN, but the steak was made to perfection with great flavor and the right temperature and just melted in your mouth with every bite. The cheddar whipped mashed potatoes with a hint of garlic and parsley was very good as well and despite us arriving close to closing time, ALL the food was fresh! Can definitely see why it was highly rated and being in the middle of the market place makes for nice scenery when dining outside."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Doug B.,"Riceville, TN",3/26/2021,5.0,"Very nice place to visit when you're walking around the Market Square. My wife and I sat at the bar. I took advantage of their great selection of craft beers on tap, many of them local. I had the crispy brussel sprouts appetizer and it was first rate. My wife had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which she was very happy with. They had a very interesting menu that I look forward to exploring on a future visit. Everything about our visit was pleasant, service was good. Highly recommended!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Stephanie B.,"Raleigh, NC",9/27/2020,4.0,"Decided to check this place out based on reviews and an attractive menu. We were not disappointed! Service was excellent, staff was friendly. Food came out timely and hot. Gave 4/5 stars because several of the bourbons we ordered were not available, would suggest a menu update. Usually that would be irritating but the customer service made up for it. The bartender even came over to apologize and make suggestions. Very impressed with this place and will return."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Brittany G.,"Dayton, TN",5/31/2021,5.0,Great food. Quick service. My husband and I truly enjoyed eating there. Hope to come back soon
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,kathy h.,"Evergreen, CO",10/9/2021,4.0,"Was seeing Knoxville, and needed some lunch so picked this place in the Market Square.  Was not disappointed.   I ordered a drink from the bar and it was excellent.   Ordered black bean burger and sweet tater fries.   The burger was delicious with avocado and onion slices.  Fries were good but I prefer them on the crispy side so fell a bit short there.   My waiter was ok.  The place was clean and had a good atmosphere.   I would recommend this place ."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kierra T.,"Atlanta, GA",9/26/2020,5.0,I totally forgot the name of the drink I had but it was soooo good and refreshing! It had the feel of a mojito but yet still nice and strong. The Buffalo chicken sandwich was good it had more breading than chicken in my option but the spiced watermelon was really why I came  and it was worth it. It just Tajin seasoning on top of watermelon and although I do it at home I've never seen a restaurant do it before
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Gail M.,"LaFollette, TN",11/20/2021,4.0,I would have given GREAT! However my favorite is the fish and chips and depending on what day you go the size varies. The first time I got it they served nice large pieces of fish. The second time it looked like an appetizer plate. I asked the waiter if there was a mistake in the order because it was not the same serving side I had previously received there. He did bring another couple of very small pieces later. Again even with the extra fish that did it was not worth the money. So please try to be more consistent. The food is amazing when you give a whole serving!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Adam A.,"Knoxville, TN",5/18/2021,1.0,"Good luck ever trying to eat here. Food is average. Service is trash. If you're ordering to go, get ready to wait ten minutes on hold, and then give up because they couldn't be bothered to answer the phone. Fuck Not Watsons."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ashley J.,"Knoxville, TN",5/16/2021,3.0,"Honestly the burgers were fantastic, the fried pickles clearly hadn't been dried off enough before they were dipped in batter it just slid off but the flavor was good. onion rings were great.However the service was top 10 worst: waiter didn't even let us have 1 minute before asking about drinks (we had no drink menu provided) so we had to look up online to meet his fast paced requirement, we ordered waters because we hadn't gotten a chance to look at the drink menus.came back 2 minutes later for food we hadn't even had a chance to look at food... we were still looking at the drink menu. he was very sub par. Not genuine and eager to get us out, which I completely understand table turnover but a relaxing environment wouldve been nice. I would not come here again if it's the slightest bit busy. But whoever is cooking in the back is doing great."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Madison M.,"Atlanta, GA",7/9/2021,5.0,One of my favorite places in Knoxville! The white cheddar potatoes and the kale Caesar salad are to DIE FOR
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mary Ann S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/8/2021,1.0,"This was not our first visit to Not Watson's on Market Square. Our last visit was a couple of years ago and was a fantastic experience. This time, we were seated promptly at a high top table near the entrance. We watched servers leisurely come and go out to the patio to take care of guests (and take water bowls out to dogs). At least the dogs got water because we did not. It was well staffed and not busy. We were within 10 feet of the host and he never called over a server to begin our order. We got up to leave and the host said ""sorry guys"". What the heck?"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Daniel K.,"Milwaukee, WI",7/3/2020,3.0,Good gastropub experience.  Pleasant service.  Nice (but not very adventurous) tap list.  Kid tolerant.  Clean and simple ambiance.   Food was decent but nothing special (and a little overpriced for quality).  Not a destination but gets job done if in area.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Gene Y.,"Mesa, AZ",6/3/2020,5.0,Great burger and excellent customer service. Having the option for sweet potato fries is appreciated. Also I ordered the house salad (they don't have side salad) which was worth the $6. Great experience.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jazmyne T.,"Irving, TX",9/28/2021,3.0,The customer service was good but the food wasn't the best. I had the flat iron steak with mashed potatoes and broccolini. The steak was really tough to chew and was bland. The mashed potatoes had a good taste. The broccolini was very salty and burnt. I love my food well seasoned but that was extremely salty. I enjoyed my husband food more than mine. He ate my steak just to prevent from wasting. We left the broccolini on the plate after I tasted that one bite. We still had to pay full price for a meal that wasn't pleasant and I left still hungry. Oh and I did enjoy the key lime pie.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Celia M.,"Hollywood, FL",3/29/2021,4.0,"Went to Not Watson's for the first time, sat at the bar. Kyle the bartender was super busy but he gave me great service and food suggestions, I had the Flank steak, it  was delicious and Kyle was great. I would definitely come back here!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jay R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/19/2021,1.0,"I try to support local during these crazy ridiculous times. I've ordered from here 3 times during the past 6 months and I can never get through on the phone. When I go order from the restaurant, the bartender always has the phone off the hook and the food ordering system disabled or ""busy"". I'm done with this place. Let it be a victim as far as I'm concerned. They never helped themselves."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Dawn C.,"Saint Paul, MN",9/18/2017,5.0,"My mom and I navigated our way through rainstorm Irma to grab a dinner here while I was in town for work. The place was mostly empty as it was Monday (and obviously pouring outside). We ordered drinks only to discover that it was half priced wine night (YES!) and knew we made the right choice.I ordered the Cajun pasta with just chicken (had to lie about a seafood allergy to avoid eating alligator, but you do what you gotta do), while my mom ordered the chimichurri flank steak and subbed out the mashes for fried red potatoes. We ate so much food it was against our better judgement. My moms steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned and my pasta was creamy with just the right amount of heat.All of this with a bottle of wine came to only $25 each after splitting the check. Seriously recommend this place - fantastic quality and excellent prices."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Baylee W.,"Columbus, OH",9/19/2020,4.0,Great brunch spot. We got a mimosa pitcher for about $15. I ordered the Market Bennie. It was really good and it came with tater tots which were cooked perfectly. Then my friend ordered the chicken biscuits and she thought was flavorful and a little spicy.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",6/7/2017,3.0,"I finally got to try out the dinner, and well the results weren't that great and I think what I came away from it was to stick to brunch.So what did I order? I ordered a pretty simplistic burger. The Parisian. The GF got the short rib sliders. So what was wrong with it? I don't think there was anything wrong, but there just wasn't a really big thing that was amazing about it that would want me to come here for a burger. I mean come on, considering the best burger in town is right next door, it's sort of hard to compete.  The Parisian burger came with some mushrooms and melted Brie cheese.Also, during our visit it came with a chlorine type smell around the whole restaurant that sort of made it feel unclean. I don't know if they just had literally wiped the tables down or something, but it just didn't smell right. I think that goes a long way when you're eating there as well and it could possibly sour your appetite. Overall, Not Watson's is just okay. I like their brunch and would probably come back for just that, otherwise I'll probably pass."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",3/3/2016,4.0,"Standing in the middle of Market Square, my friend and I were in a crisis as in that we didn't know what restaurant to choose to go to eat. While we were narrowing down the choices, Not Watson's was up to bat. We stepped in, and it was fairly full, luckily we got seats facing the keg fridge and a television hanging above it. Brunch was in full swing and the $4 mimosa and bloody mary's were a big reason for it on a Saturday... at 2 PM. Yep. You heard right. Not Watson's kitchen has a brunch going to 3 PM.  But wait, wouldn't that mean it's just basically lunch? I'm just going to go with the constantly flowing champagne and agree, yes, brunch should be served into the late afternoon.  Hey, at least I lucked out and got to try their brunch menu as well.  So let's get to it.For drinks, my friend and I ordered mimosa's... Except for this day we were on a mission to drink. So we kindly asked our waiter to hold the OJ. And which, he kindly obliged which was awesome. Custom drinks if you want? Check. Drink #1 of a series of bad decisions leading to a long night (well short actually since we started this early)? Check.To wash down our OJ-less mimosa, we sort of both eyed one item. The Egg and Steak, which was basically a Philly Cheese Steak except it also had eggs in it. With it came with some peppers and tater tots. And, the verdict? Let's say it helped soak up some of the alcohol. In all seriousness, it was a good choice. We both felt as if the cheese whiz wasn't quite the cheese that we would want on a Philly Cheese Steak, but meh... That ""original"" Philly style is what it is. If it was a better cheese I definitely would have ordered it, but it made me take a second look at other menu items.Overall, our experience was pretty good. Let's just say, brunch til 3 PM is interesting, and I don't mind it if your Friday night was extra long and you still want to peep the brunch menu out. It helps a ton. I'll be back to check out their other items on the list, but until then, Not Watson's was a great spot to start off a day bar crawl."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Alvin M.,"Tustin, CA",12/31/2020,4.0,"Ahi Tuna Sandwich and Bleu Cheese Hamburger were quite tasty. We did a flight of their more popular beers, which were good, but nothing to write home about."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Carolyn O.,"Honolulu, HI",3/16/2021,5.0,"Holy Cow, this place blew me away! We had the Blackened Mahi-Mahi with cheddar mashed potatoes and roasted red pepper & tomato beurre blanc, Grilled Salmon Filet with honey mustard sauce, grilled asparagus, house salads, and the best Tres Leches cake I've ever had. Great IPA and a hard cider. Fantastic flavors from the chef and excellent service from our waitress, Eliama. Thanks to all the staff for an unforgettable meal."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Meghan B.,"Pensacola, FL",1/3/2021,4.0,I ordered the meatloaf and philly. I shared both with my boyfriend. Both were super good! I enjoyed them both a ton. The place is super cute as well.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Susan B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/22/2020,3.0,"My husband and I decided to order online based on the reviews on Yelp. I tried ordering online and everything was fine until it got time to pay with my credit card. For whatever reason, it wouldn't process my card. I tried it twice, but it would never get past the ""thinking"" part. I decided to call the restaurant and give them my order over the phone.  We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad which was delicious. My husband ordered the flat-iron steak, medium rare. It was no less than well done. The mashed potatoes and brocollini were good. I ordered the meatloaf. It was fine. Meatloaf is meatloaf. It was served with mashed potatoes and brocollini, also. Again, it was good. We also ordered the Mac n cheese. It was yummy! We ordered a side of asparagus. I must say, it was a rip off! For what they charge, the serving was minuscule, to say the least! It was more than disappointing. I don't appreciate being ripped off. We shared a  Creme brûlée for dessert. We enjoyed that a lot! Aside from the meager serving of asparagus for the price and the overcooked steak, dinner (and plenty of leftovers) were good. While we were eating dinner, I looked at the receipt. Every single item, except the salad, was marked ""To Go."" What I'd like to know is why we were charged an extra 30 cents for each item, INCLUDING THE PHONE CALL! What is that all about? I'm being charged extra because I'm getting food to go? I was in the restaurant business for 12 years. Seems to me, there are fewer costs for someone to order to-go compared to a party who dines in the restaurant. I understand there are containers and eating utensils to pack, but that's a lot cheaper than paying manpower needed to serve, cater to, and clean up after an in-store diner. On top of that, I'm still expected to tip, even though we cannot return an overcooked steak to have it prepared properly, or to complain about the measly portion of asparagus (I really find it hard to believe they would have served that portion to a dine-in customer), plus we have to clean up after ourselves. And who charges 30 cents for a to-go phone call??? Come on, guys!! Talk about nickel and dime-ing your customers!  It's the principle of the thing, fellas! Needless to say, that bummed us out. That is why we give Not Watson's three stars. A restaurant experience is not all about the food."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Keegan J.,"Austin, TX",7/18/2020,5.0,Not Watson's is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Knoxville. Great location right in market square and such great food. Nothing but good things to say :)
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Joi D.,"Knoxville, TN",7/16/2020,5.0,Went recently here for lunch and had Caleb as my server.  He was very attentive and polite and can't wait to go back!  Such excellent service!!!!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Karen R.,"Orange, TX",7/11/2020,1.0,"Terrible service. Waited awhile to be greeted.  By the time we was acknowledged, we ordered a drink and server server was appalled that we wanted to go ahead and place food order...he  Never came back to even ask if we needed anything else. I would leave his name, however, he never told us his name. It was told to him that we only left a 20% tip because that was how we were raised...he didnt deserve, but maybe he will try to do right next time."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,M K.,"Saint Johns, FL",7/7/2020,5.0,Very cool spot. Food was so good and the service was excellent. So glad you were open!!!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Daniel K.,"Milwaukee, WI",7/3/2020,3.0,Good gastropub experience.  Pleasant service.  Nice (but not very adventurous) tap list.  Kid tolerant.  Clean and simple ambiance.   Food was decent but nothing special (and a little overpriced for quality).  Not a destination but gets job done if in area.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Brittany R.,"Miami Beach, FL",7/2/2020,5.0,Visited this place with some friends and family and the food was amazing. We drive 14hrs all the way from Miami and I was looking for a place open late we could eat dinner. I found them here on yelp and i was happy because everyone was telling me that I choose a great spot for our first dinner in Knoxville. Not to mention I loved the streets and feeling of downtown Knoxville!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ann G.,"La Grange, IL",6/27/2020,4.0,"Nice stop in Knoxville. Friendly service, outdoor dining, yummy food. Biscuits, chicken and gravy was a favorite of our table."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Steve U.,"Knoxville, TN",6/16/2020,4.0,"I haven't been in Knoxville long enough to get the reference, but they make good burgers and have an excellent whiskey selection"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kaitlyn H.,"Pigeon Forge, TN",6/15/2020,4.0,"Love Not Watson's, I always get the Philly cheesesteak and it never disappoints! It's a little small inside but booths and tables are cozy."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lexie G.,"Knoxville, TN",1/4/2021,5.0,This is by far the best restaurant I have eaten at. I have been here three times this week! I have never had anything less than delicious here and the staff is so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu every time I come in. If you go here you HAVE to try the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls. They are a MUST HAVE! 10/10 would recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Faith B.,"Milwaukee, WI",5/17/2018,5.0,"I visited for lunch with a few colleagues recently. We were seated immediately and our drinks came quickly.Our server, Marcus, was very friendly and attentive. He was also very accommodating to our substitutions and answered our menu questions patiently.I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad and substituted in salmon. It was excellent - full of flavor, large and very filling. A note for carb watchers - it does come with wonton strips on top that are not listed on the menu description. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals as well, 2 other entree salads and a big burger.Great downtown lunch option with a little something for everyone and an impressive drink menu to sample on future visits."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Karyssa P.,"Corbin, KY",9/29/2019,5.0,"This is my favorite restaurant in Knoxville! The wait staff is very knowledgeable with the specials and drink menus, and are very professional. However, the best part of the dine in experience is the food! From the appetizers to the entrées, you can be sure that your taste buds will be packed with bursts of flavor.The second best part of Dining here is the plating. Whether you're a food blogger or just the average food photographer, your eyes will be fixed on the gorgeous and miticulous art that goes into each plate. You won't be disappointed!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tracy G.,"Mission, KS",7/9/2018,4.0,"First of all, this restaurant is in a wonderful area. We were visiting for work from out of state and had been advised to ""go downtown- that all the restaurants were great"". They were especially right about this place.Now I will say that the wait listed on Yelp was inaccurate to the wait quoted at the Hostess stand. However, we were a large group (7) and even an hour wait seemed reasonable enough. But since they didn't offer us the option to grab a drink at the bar and start a tab, we went across the way to another establishment for a few cocktails while waiting. (A little loss in business and opportunities for profit, in my opinion)We waited to the hour quote precisely. Then we're seated at a nice table near the front. The menu was fairly comprehensively and as a Vegan I found a few dishes that worked with mild enhancements. I ended up with the black bean burger without the aioli. I kept the fries and added a side of broccoli as well. I also ordered one of their whiskey flights as well: The Tennessee Trail. It was a nice variety of 4 whiskeys. They were out of one listed, but their substitute ended up being my favorite out of the batch. All in all, a good meal. My downside was the waitress seemed rather MIA. I mean, lovely and friendly when she was there and willing to offer suggestions on menu items. But we only saw her 3 times throughout the almost 2hrs we were there. Drinks sat empty for quite a while. Runners brought the food out. She took our orders, brought the drinks and then the checks... that's about it."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Bob Y.,"Powell, OH",9/7/2020,1.0,"My wife and I were traveling through Knoxville and we stopped here for lunch. It was very disappointing. The kitchen was very slow and the waitress was apparently overloaded. We both ordered the strawberry chicken salad. The flavor was good but it was probably the smallest entree salad I've ever seen. There was about a cup and a half of greens, a few chopped pecans, some sliced strawberries and a few sliced pieces of chicken.  I wouldn't go back."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christine A.,"Orlando, FL",12/18/2020,5.0,"Sooo good!! Ok, My husband loves Philly cheesesteak (and I do Not) But we ordered the Philly Egg Rolls and I was begging my husband to order more!! Melt-in-your-mouth AWESOMENESS!! Also, ordered the double-barrel margarita‐ perfectly made by RICKEY!! Go try this place out... it is worth Every bite and Every sip!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Callie H.,"League City, TX",6/16/2021,4.0,Love this place!! The chicken and waffles is so good! My only holdback from a 5 star review was that my husband got a side wedge salad and my cousin got an entree wedges salad and they were the same size.  However we were charged $4 since it was considered a side salad but my cousin was charged full price.  That's my only thing.  Everything else was amazing!

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sheena S.,"Alpharetta, GA",2/19/2018,5.0,"A rainy day in Market Square yields long wait times at restaurants. We first went into Honey Tupelo, the wait there was one hour and we put our names down and sat down. Every two to five minutes the door opened and we shivered with the cold air, but party after party we watched ppl being told 45 minutes to an hour wait. While we were sitting I went on my beloved and oh so trusted Yelp. Not Watson's came up and THE OPTION TO GET ON THE WAITLIST WAS AVAILABLE! what a CONVENIENT feature!!!!!! Bam, did that. Told me to check in within fifteen minutes. It was decision time. Looked at Honey Tupelo's menu, then at Not Watson's menu on my phone and it was a no brainer. We were outta Honey Tupelo and happily strolled the few few fee to Not Watsons. Reported for our check in and were seated at a table in a couple minutes!SCORE!!!My husband said this restaurant was WAY better interior wise than Honey Tupelo. He said the tables at HT are all crammed together and Not Watson's is more restaurant like. I was glad to hear this. It was our first day in Knoxville. I'm also glad we didn't stay at HT because I found out they have them in Georgia meaning it is not a restaurant unique to Knoxville. Anyhow, onto Watson's.Appetizer: Fried Green Tomatoes We were starving, so as soon as we sat down, I just told the waiter the first thing I saw on the menu which was fried green tomatoes. When the dish arrived I saw it had pimento cheese and ham on top. I personally do not like pimento cheese. However, that didn't stop us. I scooped it off and still enjoyed the fried green tomatoes. The batter was crisp and tasty, the tomatoes were a lil thin, but still overall a good appetizer. We packed the pimento cheese and my husband had it on a bagel the next morning. Hi5!Entrees: Not Yo Mama's chicken and waffles - The chicken was delicious. My children had this dish and when they don't have a problem eating it, I know we have a winner. You also get cubes of watermelon. It is sprinkled with chilli powder. That threw my kids off, but my husband and I love spice, so we enjoyed it. Plus, since my kids love watermelon, the mentally told their mouths to eat it, lol. The waffle and syrup were nice and hot, so we enjoyed the food temperature coming in from the rainy weather. Blackened Mahi Mahi- Very heavy and filling. Again, I ordered dishes but didn't really read the descriptions, so was discovering the dish while eating. A unique tomato blanc sauce surrounds the mahi which is on top of a bed of slaw salad like veggies and mashed potatoes. Not a flavor I've had often and it worked. Felt very food network like. I would just cook the mahi a lil less time so it falls into layers at the touch of my fork, but a great dish!Creole Pasta- Shrimp, alligator, and chicken in a delicious cajun cream sauce with linguine. All the flavors dance in your mouth and you're eager to take your next bite! Yum! However, the alligator was very tough. Next time, I'd just skip it all together and just have the shrimp and chicken.Our server was so friendly and pleasant. Checked on us throughout the meal, chatted, the whole 9. Therefore, I've given the restaurant five stars. Service from our waiter and the food was great!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Becky B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/18/2019,5.0,"So we were having double date night! The girls wanted a good rich salad and the boys of course wanted a burger and beer..... mmmmm where should we go? My friend recommended this place. Hands down not a single complaint. We both were eying the strawberry salad that came with grilled chicken and our kind waitress told us we could substitute another protein instead of the chicken and suggested the blackened salmon. We girls had that and the boys had the parisan burger and beer. My salad was to die for! Ok, who can really say that about a salad! So filling and delicious. The boys were impressed with the flavor in the mushrooms and sauce the burger had! So yeah date night was a success due to this place!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lyndsay S.,"LaFollette, TN",5/30/2020,5.0,"We Ate there tonight, great food and great menu selection! We can't wait to go back! I had the flat iron steak and my husband had a burger and both were wonderful"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christie B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/21/2018,3.0,"I ordered the black bean burger and loved it! We sat outside on a Tuesday night when market square has the jazz musicians. It wasn't that busy, it was almost ten, but I still felt like the food took too long. Drinks also seemed weak. I ordered the hard strawberry lemonade. For get me wrong, food was tasty, but I'm not in love with anything! Oh and a plus is you get tons of fries in that basket"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jeff M.,"Orlando, FL",7/27/2019,4.0,"I went with the Creole pasta.  Delicious, just enough heat for this spice wimp, good balance between all the components.  I did notice one tough piece of gator: where'd that come from?  It was followed by a piece of chocolate cake: five layers of yum, plenty of frosting, slightly on the dry side.  I was at the bar, service was good."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Emma R.,"Raleigh, NC",4/30/2019,5.0,"Awesome service, cool atmosphere, great food!!! So happy I tried this place on my biz trip. Great place to work on my laptop and enjoy food all at once."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Iva C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/30/2018,4.0,One of my favorite restaurants in Market Square! They have really tasty burgers and drinks. The atmosphere is comfortable and a great spot to enjoy a good meal with friends. I have been here a few times and it's always consistent and the service is great!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/18/2015,4.0,"I reserved for a table of 14 for dinner; they can only hold the table for 10-15 minutes. When we arrived, our table wasn't ready and we had quite a wait time but it worked out perfectly because a group of us were running late. I ordered the spicy black bean burger with tater tots and I  tried some of my friend's sweet potato fries. The burger was way better than it looks. The bun was warm and toasty and the patty was flavorful, consistent, moist and filling. The tater tots were amazingly crunchy and the portion was pleasing. The sweet potato fries were also making my tongue dance; it wasn't too mushy, too crunchy or too salty. Overall, not only did I enjoy the food, but everyone else here that night did. The staff was attentive to my party of 14 and the food came out in a timely manner. The server split the check for all of us, which I'm super grateful for because there were no complications with the math and with people only having credit cards. I highly recommend coming here if you have a large party craving for burgers or hot dogs."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Addy G.,"Queen Creek, AZ",3/2/2019,4.0,"I came to Not Watson's on my lunch break during a work trip. It was very busy when I got there, primetime lunchtime and also in the middle of a huge conference in town. I was able to get a seat right at the bar. I didn't feel too bad about it because there were a lot of people sitting at the bar by themselves. I had checked out the menu outside so I knew exactly what I wanted. Matthew was my server and he was great. Really fast. I ordered the grilled salmon spinach salad and a lemon water. It came out in about 10 minutes and the cut of the salmon was very large. I am not used to getting that big of a cut of fish for such an inexpensive price. The fish is presented on a bed of spinach with some cheese, raw onions, (which I took off), and very light dressing which I appreciated. The price was extremely reasonable for the size of the portion. Also, I did order the salmon grilled and it tasted blackened-too much seasoning and a little bit too salty. Overall, for a quick lunch fix, this was just fine for the price."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,MoMo K.,"University Village, Chicago, IL",8/9/2017,5.0,"Creekstone beef! The best Burger I've ever had! The ""Pretty Hot Burger"" was super spicy and it can be challenging to eat if you're not use to spicy food. The calamari is delicious! Can also say that was the best I've ever had. I don't know what sauce they give the calamari with, but it's pretty darn good and I always ask for extra on the side so I can put on my burger. FYI: you can sub-in your fries for tater tots. They have outdoor seating and a ton of space inside. Even then, you may have to wait on weekends. Every time I'm in the knoxville area, will def try to stop here. Just a tip: parking in the garage is free after 6pm on week days and all day on weekends."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Alan S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/20/2020,5.0,Met friends here for burgers and beer and we were not disappointed.This place is a must stop when roaming around downtown Knoxville. Seating can be tight but this place has a great menu and excellent beer choices.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Alveta S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/26/2019,5.0,I had a friend visiting from out of town so we decided to stop in for a quick lunch and $5 Mojito. It was around lunch on a Thursday and we were immediately seated. We had the Brussel sprouts as an appetizer and they were cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend them as an appetizer. I was not a big fan of the butter sauce that accompanied the sprouts. It wasn't bad but I'm more of a balsamic and olive oil fan when it comes to my Brussel sprouts. I ordered the turkey burger (added bacon) with sweet potato fries. The burger and fries were very good. I enjoyed the mojito but my friend thought it was a bit too sweet. She is more of a beer drinker so I would say that's more on her and less on the bartender. Overall I would definitely recommend visiting Not Watson's.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Alli R.,"Asheville, NC",3/11/2019,4.0,"Amazing food, relaxed vibe, and friendly staff! We got the calamari, the fried brussels, and the seared scallops with cheddar and bacon grits (honestly one of my favorite bites on our weekend getaway to Knoxville). The scallops were perfectly buttery and the grits were scrumptious cheesy goodness. We also tried the spinach salad with salmon which was the perfect light but nourishing end to the meal. Would have been a 5 star experience if the server did not rush us to order before the kitchen closed."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lori W.,"Knoxville, TN",6/25/2015,5.0,"Wow..Definetly not a frozen hamburger patty..Amazing Marketplace Hamburger...it was cooked perfectly, juicy, not greasy. The fries were crispy, very well cooked. Fresh potatoes not frozen.The waitress was very friendly and helpful.We was seated and greeted immediately after walking in.Ordered the carrot cake for dessert....ohhhhh myyyyyyy....the plating was excellently done.Taste great...very moist, not overly sweet. Carmel adds alittle extra sweetness but doesn't overpower the taste. Fresh carrots...buttercream frosting. Really good. MUST try.Highly recommended...Will definetly be back!!!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Michelle E.,"London, KY",2/9/2020,3.0,The food was fresh and delicious. The service was horrible. Alejandro seems more concerned about speaking with his co workers than doing his actual job. Simple requests like boxes at the end of the meal was met with an attitude of seeming annoyance. Even our teenager noticed his attitude was put out. Sad about our experience here.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Joshua L.,"Powell, TN",3/11/2020,5.0,"This is easily a top 5 restaurant in Knoxville. I have been for brunch and dinner and have been blown away by the quality every time. The Philly cheesesteak egg rolls are unique and bursting with amazing flavor. The Creole pasta is hands down my favorite thing on the menu, and possibly my favorite pasta dish ever. Perfectly cooked onions and red bell peppers really enhance the flavor of the fresh gator, shrimp, and chicken all tossed in a creamy and rich Cajun Alfredo sauce. I could legitimately eat here every night of the week. This restaurant definitely takes great pride in the quality of their food and service. Couple great food and service with an awesome craft beer selection and you have the recipe for a top notch dining experience. I would highly recommend giving this place a shot. You won't regret it and you will more than likely become a regular after you try this place just once!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Reema P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",6/7/2019,4.0,I really enjoy the brunch at Not Watson's. The veggie omelette and veggie bennie is great but my new go to for brunch that hits the spot if the chicken and biscuits. It's filled with flavor and the fried chicken is so good and whatever sweet and spicy sauce that is on that is a perfect combo. Unfortunately the blood marys here seem really watered down and lack flavor.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kendall S.,"Dayton, OH",9/14/2020,5.0,This place was great! The fried green tomatoes were amazing! Huge though! Hardly had room for our meals after eating these!  Ha!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",3/16/2019,4.0,"Good atmosphere and food. I've tried the egg rolls, blackened mahi mahi, and the ribeye. All were good but might pass on the steak as it's not as good as a steak house. I'd definitely order the fish again as it was a large portion that seemed priced right and was so tasty. We went around 7:30 on a saturday and it was an hour wait for 4 people. The system they use is very convenient. Just give them your phone number and walk away. They text when your table is ready so you're not stuck sitting there. Our waiter was still in training and had only been there two days but he was great and never missed a beat. Can't wait to try something else the next time I eat here."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Caitlin C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/4/2019,5.0,"Not Watson's is an American food restaurant and every time I've eaten there (third time on Super Bowl Sunday) it has been excellent. I have gotten the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, black and blue sliders, creole pasta, fried pickles, and black bean burger and all were great. It's a great place to watch sports and my service has always been great.I think this place gets overlooked but it really is good food. I want to go back and try the salmon and creme brulee. Highly recommend."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ashley L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1/21/2018,5.0,"Not Watson's Kitchen & Bar is probably one of my favorite spots in all of Market Square and one of my go to spots when in need of a solid brunch or lunch spot.This place offers a seriously updated and unique twist on traditional southern cuisine. Their starters, salads, burgers and entrees are solid. They keep their menu updated and seasonal which is a huge perk so there is always something new to try or you can usually stick to your ""usual"" order if you're like me and a creature of habit.I've never had a poor experience here. The price, customer service, quality of food and overall atmosphere is memorable. I would highly recommend anyone come here at least once to try it out for themselves."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Linda B.,"New Albany, OH",9/2/2020,5.0,"Fun location on the square.  We stayed at the Hyatt Place and this was an easy 5 minute walk.  We got a seat outside (our preference) and both of our meals were excellent.  However, the winning vote goes to the fried green tomatoes appetizer - oh, my goodness!!  Would definitely go here again."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jack C.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/29/2019,5.0,"I had the Chicken & Biscuits durning brunch; it was absolutely amazing. I'm struggling to process just how good each component really is. The biscuits are firm even smothered in gravy, they have a bold, but not overwhelming flavor. I can taste the biscuit through the gravy, they complement each other perfectly. The fried chicken has just the right amount of seasoning, it's bold and shines alone and fits perfectly with the other items on the plate. The chicken has a gentle honey glaze coating each of the pieces that helps it stand out from the other friend chicken I've had on my trip. The over medium egg adds another layer of flavor and complexity to this already phenomenal dish. I enjoy a yoke, so having that little extra helps put Not Watson's breakfast over the top as one of my all time favorite meals. Not just breakfast, but an all time, top 15 meals. Maybe in the top 5."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Justin W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/26/2019,5.0,"We visited on a Monday mid afternoon. It wasn't overly busy, the staff was friendly and nice.

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Dawn D.,"Winter Garden, Orlando, FL",5/4/2019,4.0,"This place has a primo location on Market Square - their outdoor seating was perfect for a late Friday night dinner and people watching.  Their mule cocktail was fantastic and very refreshing.  The ambiance and drinks were great.   The food was generally good but did not blow us away and  some items were disappointing.  The Cobb salad lacked flavor and the dressing was underwhelming.  In contrast, the fried green tomatoes were served with pimento cheese on top and very good so make sure to try them!  The Brussels sprouts were a little soggy but tasty when dipped in the hollandaise sauce. Overall worth stoping in but only if you order wisely!!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Terri H.,"Franklin, TN",2/27/2017,4.0,I love that this place is on the nowait app.  I wish more restaurants were on it.  I used the app to check the wait time and put our name on the list.  We headed toward the restaurant from our son's apartment when we were 14th in line with about 20 minutes to wait.  We were down to a 12 minute wait when we arrived and I checked in with the hostess to let her know we were there.  The wait time was close and we were actually seated a few minutes early.The hostess and our server were very friendly.  Our server was happy to answer questions and help us decide from all the great menu options.  It was packed inside but that is a sign of good food right?  We were seated in the middle of the place at a high top table.  There were booths against the wall and some tables toward the back of the restaurant.  The overall feeling was a comfortable place to meet and catch up with family or friends.As far as food is concerned the menu was the main reason we chose to give this place a try.  I was in the mood for a great black bean burger.  My son is a steak lover and his girlfriend is a vegetarian so there were options available for all.  I ordered the black bean burger without a bun with tater tots on the side.  I'm always a sucker for tater tots. It was as great as I had hoped it would be.  I highly recommend this place.  You can even download the app to see how long the wait will be.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Steffani F.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",10/30/2017,5.0,"Drinks were great with a slight twist on the classics. Hubby had a Jalissco Old Fashioned which is made with tequila. I had the Double Barrel Margarita and both were delicious. Atmosphere is a mix of old exposed bricks with modern decor. Music is going and tv's are covered with football highlights. Comfortable atmosphere with good drinks. Menu looks good - salads, burgers and entrees - but we're just drinking today."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Erika M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/13/2015,5.0,"I didn't know what to make out of Not Watson's.   I had heard the good and heard the bad.  I decided that I needed to try this tator tot dishing place for myself.  I don't know what I expected when I walked in, but the restaurant was really cool inside.  The bar lines the left wall and booths on the right all the way back to the kitchen.  We went on a Thursday night and found a lively crowd.  Right off the bat, I got a sports bar vibe....but a cool sports bar.  Lots of local memorabilia dawning the walls with local photos and loud music.  Normally, I am not a fan of loud music in restaurants, but somehow it really works with the vibe...or maybe it was just the on point song selections.We were seated promptly and our server grabbed our drink order right away.  Our server was great!  He talked me into their nightly drink special - a $5 mojito (which didn't take much arm twisting) and gave us time with digest their hefty menu.  While making notes of about a dozen things I want to try on future visits (Yes, I was already committed to return trips), I ordered the ALL ORGANIC TURKEY BURGER NO.2. (BLEU CHEESE, BACON, CARAMELIZED ONIONS, LETTUCE, TOMATO & NOT SAUCE) It's organic and turkey.  That count's as healthy, right?! As my sides, it felt like it would have been a crime to order anything other than the tots.  While waiting for our food, our server brought us samples of the their latest beer, delivered with thorough knowledge of it's origin.  You did read that correctly.  Our server brought us beer to try...for free.  That's what I'm saying.  We had really great service!Once our food arrived, I put any reservations about this place to rest.  The tots were cooked to crispy perfection and my burger was the kind of mess you expect from a good burger.  It was cooked perfectly and adorned with a healthy dose of bleu cheese and caramelized onions.  I managed to make a healthy dent in my meal, but didn't come close to finishing.  The portion size will definitely not leave you hungry.  We had a great experience at Not Watson's and I am eager for my next visit to cross some of the must eats off of my list.  I hear a Chicago dog calling my name..."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Bernard M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/14/2019,5.0,"If you are looking for something different with a familiar theme, Not Watson's is your place. Examples: pork belly tacos, flat iron kale Caesar salad, chicken & waffles (cheddar cheese waffles) are all prepared with TLC. Service is fantastic. This has to be one of the most well-run restaurants in Knoxville."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Devin O.,"Sarasota, FL",9/10/2020,5.0,"The food was absolutely amazing, and that's not something I say lightly. From just viewing the menu I began to suspect that the chefs really knew what they were doing, but once I tasted it my suspicions were not only met but even exceeded. Every last part of it was notably delicious. And the service was outstanding. Not to mention health safety was followed to the utmost degree. I can't recommend this place enough. So happy to have stumbled upon it!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Susan C.,"Gallatin, TN",12/21/2019,5.0,"In town for a wedding and someone recommended this for a family dinner.  No reservations on weekends but we called in early and got onto the Yelp waitlist. By the time we arrived they were almost ready for us! It's noisy, which made conversation a challenge. BUT the food was excellent  - something for everyone. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Good selection of craft beers and other beverages. We were very happy with our choice!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ariana S.,"Alpharetta, GA",6/24/2019,4.0,"I liked the atmosphere, was a little dark inside, but not bad. I thought it was a bit expensive. My coleslaw was $4 and then the alcoholic beverage and sandwich added up. Although, it was delicious! The bread on my sandwich was crispy and tasted amazing with the fried alligator and sauce. French fries were good and I really liked the coleslaw. Would go again!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Stacy B.,"Brentwood, TN",10/23/2019,3.0,"We weren't super impressed. Our college aged son wanted us to take him there when we came in town, so for his palate it's GREAT. Deduce what you will from that. I think the food was fine, but the ambiance was lacking. It's a sports bar that serves a decent sized menu, which is fine for what it is. I was hoping for a restaurant that has TVs all around. Ladies room was so clean...excellent. Like a bar, the floors all over were kinda sticky and the tables were tall pub tables. Not comfy for a petite woman. Waitress was fine, but not super attentive and failed to refill drinks (waters, etc)."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Richard G.,"Pigeon Forge, TN",8/7/2019,5.0,"Great food! We had the onion rings, chicken and waffles, mushroom burger all great. Washington our waiter was friendly and helpful with his exceptional service."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christina R.,"Wilmington, NC",7/15/2017,5.0,"Be prepared for multiple napkins and the use of both hands to eat their Chili Macaroni n Cheese burger. It was messy, but boy that was a tasty burger. Pretty good burger I've had in a while. Never thought that chili with macaroni n cheese, on a burger would good really well... Again, comfort food on a burger? Heck yeah! For a Friday evening, it was busy and we had a 30-min wait for a party of 3. But it was worth the wait. Our waitress was very helpful on suggestions (suggested the Chili Macaroni n Cheese burger) and made sure our drinks were always filled."

We have become a little disillusioned with S&B, the service has dropped off in our opinion. So, that being said, we came to Not Watson's for a Market Square visit and hamburger. WOW! Great food! But, let me tell ya, eat at the bar and let Frank and Kyle take care of you. This is our new burger joint.Another great meal with great service from Kyle at the bar. Seriously, go try this place. The food is fantastic and the service doesn't act like you're an interruption to their day."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jim S.,"Dayton, OH",9/23/2018,5.0,"Had a great dinner on the patio. Service was prompt, efficient, and attentive. Extensive draft beer selection, although the waiter really didn't know what all they had for rotating taps and didn't have a list with him. We had three burgers and all were cooked perfectly to order. Very juicy. Strawberry chicken salad was amazing."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Gary N.,"Knoxville, TN",9/1/2014,2.0,"First off the only reason they don't get a one star is how new they are. Came in after lunch crowd and the place looked like a bomb went off. Tables covered, uncleared after people left. About 5 minutes before we and others even saw a hostess. She came back smiling and sat someone out if order. Few minutes later we were told 30 minutes even though the place was half empty. Not sure if it's just disorganized or people issues. As I write this we asked our waitress. Looks like some people were out so managers running front with inexperienced help. So they may bounce back and I will give them another go in a few weeksFood wise, the burgers are excellent here. Brats are also big on the menu. With the right help and leadership they should be better"

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Y. G.,"Dallas, TX",1/19/2019,5.0,"This place is edgy, but don't let that make you think  the servers don't care. The waitress we had was very nice and attentive. She refilled our drinks several times, which is very important to us. It's a small place, but it's cute! Our food and drinks were on point. We had fried pickles for an appetizer. Our main dishes were  chimichurri Steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli, and alligator poboy with French fries. I also had a cucumber mixed drink (don't remember the name). Over all, great experience."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Danielle M.,"Alpharetta, GA",12/13/2020,4.0,"This restaurant is so yummy! I went on a date here, ordered a burger, (bold move I know) and it was amazing."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ann R.,"Milwaukee, WI",11/30/2018,4.0,"When I want good food at a reasonable price, I head to Not Watson's. The regular menu boasts a nice selection of burger and sandwich options, some solid entrees, and a range of tasty sides including the beloved tater tots. There's something for everyone. On the weekends, they have a brunch menu (and mimosas!) that's hard to pass up. The service is on point, and even during busier hours, there's enough seating in the place that you don't usually have to wait long if at all for a table."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Savannah C.,"Old North Knoxville, Knoxville, TN",6/5/2019,5.0,Get the fried green tomatoes!! So so good! The servers are very good there! They have a good selection of craft beer and creative cocktails! It's a very chill setting with dim lighting (my phone gets no service)
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Charlie S. W.,"Powell, TN",9/23/2018,4.0,"On Wednesday, the 19th of September, I chose to dine at Not Watson's restaurant in downtown Knoxville in Market Square. Not Watson's is New American style restaurant and emphasizes in providing organic and farm to table products whenever available. When we first arrived at the restaurant for the dinner service, we were greeted by a smiling face. There were three of us in the party; myself, my friend and my son. Upon being seated, one of the first things I notice was how clean the establishment was as well as the overall ambiance of the restaurant.Not Watson's has an inviting, laid back and energetic atmosphere, but at the same time has a very inimitable and sexy vibe. Some of the décor included vintage gas station signs. The lighting was darker and relaxing with individual fixtures just above the tables. The tables were very clean and laid out in an methodical fashion. After looking over the menu, I felt as if it was enticing as well as clear and concise in its descriptions of the food. I noticed several classic ""bar food"" menu items but with an innovative twist. As I gazed across the dining room I noticed that it was only about 55% full. The bar area was very nice and had a modern look and seemed very inviting. In the way that the dining room and floor plan was laid out, it did not seem very handicap friendly. Of course, this is in Market Square, where most of the clientele are younger people.After being seated for approximately five minutes, we were finally greeted by Monica C., our server. As someone who works in the industry I am very patient and understanding, however, five minutes is pushing it when it comes to a greet-time. Monica was very friendly and personable. After she informed us of their five-dollar martini special, I soon forgot about how long it took her to greet us. I ordered a dirty gin martini and it did not disappoint.After receiving our martinis, we placed our order. We started off with the Fried Green Tomato appetizer. When they were brought out to the table, I hoped that they would taste as good as they looked. The tomatoes were topped with house-made pimiento cheese, homemade tomato jam and garnished with julienned country ham. They were absolutely remarkable and were fried to perfection. The batter wasn't too thick, and the cheese and jam really complimented the flavor of the tomato. For my main course, I ordered the pan roasted 14oz. pork porterhouse with cremini risotto, braised baby arugula and balsamic reduction. The T-Bone was cooked to a perfect medium just as I ordered it and had a great sear and crust on the outside. The risotto was creamy and cooked to a perfect al-dente, with amazing umami flavor from the creminis. The arugula and balsamic reduction played an integral part in the cohesiveness of the dish.The food exceeded my expectations and I cannot wait to try more of what their menu has to offer. Overall my experience was excellent. The food was mouthwatering, but the service definitely could have been better. Our server, Monica, never checked back to see how our food was after delivering either course. She was friendly but could've been more attentive. If I were to make any changes it would simply be to make sure my staff always checked back after the first few bites are taken by the guest so that if there is any issue, it can be resolved right away. If my T-Bone had been overcooked or undercooked I would have had no one to inform, luckily for me, it was absolutely impeccable. On the way out of the restaurant I noticed the health scores clearly displayed on the wall close to the entrance. Their last two health inspections scored a 98 and a 96 respectively. As far as I could tell the scores reflected the current conditions of the restaurant. I will definitely be back for more of those fried green tomatoes and five-dollar martinis as well as to try more of the chef's creations on the entrée menu."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Greg M.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2016,4.0,"50+ restaurants downtown and I'm on a mission to try them all for lunch. Not Watson's is your basic casual place to eat. Burgers, salads, sandwiches. The interior style is rustic. I ate outside under the big awning. I had the Good Morning burger, which is topped with a fried egg. Pretty tasty. Nice bun that held together despite the messy burger innards. The fries are fine too. $9.50 is a fair price. My waitress was nice but forced the fake cheerfulness a bit too much. A little annoying but not awful. (Tell her to relax). I don't know why I'm not more enthusiastic about Not Watson's. There's nothing wrong with it. Food is good. Prices are in line everything else downtown. It just doesn't stand out from the crowd in any way."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jason M.,"Hendersonville, TN",11/24/2020,5.0,"Not Watson's was the first restaurant I visited this month after moving to Knoxville. We came on a Tuesday for their happy hour and were pleasantly surprised with $3 craft beers on Tuesday!! We got an appetizer and 2 meals, and everything was perfect. The bartender/our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and drink options, and was always very helpful. We will be back, especially because of the COVID precautions! Great place!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Dewayne L.,"Corryton, TN",2/1/2020,5.0,"The three best things on the menu are Chicken & Waffles, Chicken & Waffles and Chicken & Waffles! A friend told us about this plate and that's what they recommended. Last time I tried the fish and chips which were also good, but I found myself sneaking food off of my wife's plate of, you guessed it, ChIcken & Waffles. Super friendly and attentive staff. If you go for date  night, ask for a seat in the back. Seems  quieter there."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Biggezzie C.,"Gastonia, NC",1/28/2019,5.0,We were in Knoxville for a weekend volleyball tournament. We stumbled on this place after our first choice had a 2 hour wait. Disappointed by that we were not expecting much. However we were blown away by the top notch service and meal. I particularly enjoyed the cheesesteak egg rolls app and the Creole pasta. Would definitely go back when in the city.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Susan P.,"San Diego, CA",2/17/2016,4.0,"I came here for brunch on a windy, warm and bright winter day. And while lots of things looked tasty on the menu, there were some minor flaws on the presentation. I drooled hard over the menu, and then felt like I didn't order the right thing when I got my Cheese steak with eggs. The Bloody Mary was certainly serviceable and was good to the last drop. I'll try again, cause they were pleasant, quick, and packed!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jennifer A.,"Chicago, IL",5/23/2018,2.0,"Well I was really excited about trying this place and it ended up being a complete bust. The second star is for our waitress who was nice, nothing amazing like my friends thought, but she was a decent.I went to the restaurant with a group of 6 and it had a nice vibe and atmosphere. However, all of our food was burnt to some extent and over cooked. My friend ordered the pork belly tacos and literally felt like they tasted like char off a grill. She sent them back and the manager was demeaning and disrespectful by alluding that she didn't know how they were supposed to be cooked and that they were made just fine. He acted like she was inconveniencing them and that the food was fine when I would never personally eat it. He should've tried a piece of of the meat himself and he might've then agreed.My hamburger was okay. I ordered it medium rare but it came well done. Literally. No joke. Everything at our table was over cooked. I didn't even finish the burger because it was that unappealing and I love burgers and typically finish them wherever I get one. I guess their fries were good and I ordered a fried pickle appetizer which was also pretty good. All in all the manager was rude and he never even took the pork belly tacos off my friend's tab which I thought was completely unacceptable and unprofessional. So much for the customer is always right. The food was burnt. Said it at the restaurant and I'll say it again, the customer service sucked. If you want char off the grill make some steaks at home and scrape your grill off. Put what you scraped in a tortilla with some avocado and voila a home cooked Not Watson's dinner at the comfort of your own home. Maybe if it was Watson's it would've been a decent meal."

Looking forward to trying more items from the menu!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Aiden S.,"Island Home, Knoxville, TN",2/28/2020,5.0,This place is beyond what I expected. I ordered the philly and and it is the best I have ever had in my life.

Going to order some entrees here in a few and I'll be back. The chicken wings are outstanding. Very good, classic wing taste that true buffalo wing fans are looking for. The tuna sandwich was sushi grade. Seared and rare in he center. Excellent. Wasabi mayo, and soy mixture was awesome. Great place to drink and eat"

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sam E.,"Knoxville, TN",7/5/2019,1.0,We waited for over almost 3 hours and never got called.  We were told 40 min.  They were rude.  They forgot us and could care less.  They said had wrong number.  Bottomline....had a party of 12 and apparently that's too much for them.  Have no clue the food quality but service was awful and it's apparently management can't handle too much.  We took our money elsewhere.  Will not give them another chance regardless of food quality.  Knoxville has too many options with great food.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Will M.,"Lexington, KY",8/12/2018,5.0,"Very great atmosphere walking up with a nice patio on the front.  Decent draft list with some signature cocktails as well.  There was a group of 4 and the outside patio wait was about 45 minutes , but you can put you name down and walk around the square there.  One of he specials was bacon wrapped meatloaf which is what I got and  my wife got a burger.  They both were great, although in pictures a piece of meatloaf wrapped in bacon it only came with 2 pieces underneath the meat loaf.  It came with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli both very good."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kate W.,"Prescott, AZ",6/11/2018,4.0,"A great place! Good food, good service, great atmosphere. I ordered a brunch item - country fried steak and eggs, with the most delicious fruit salad to accompany. My friend had a cobb salad that was fresh and crisp and the dressing was to die for! I think it was the avocado ranch and it was very tasty. We nibbled on each other's plates until we were going to burst!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sandy B.,"East Dundee, IL",10/10/2020,4.0,We ordered appetizers. They were very good but the stand out was the Brussel sprouts! I would give them 5 stars but the hostess was less than enthused to greet us or seat us and our server had no expression. We actually joked that he must hate his life or job. We paid promptly but it took him over 10 min to come back with our card. That's always a concern when someone walks off with your visa
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Susan B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/22/2020,3.0,"My husband and I decided to order online based on the reviews on Yelp. I tried ordering online and everything was fine until it got time to pay with my credit card. For whatever reason, it wouldn't process my card. I tried it twice, but it would never get past the ""thinking"" part. I decided to call the restaurant and give them my order over the phone.  We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad which was delicious. My husband ordered the flat-iron steak, medium rare. It was no less than well done. The mashed potatoes and brocollini were good. I ordered the meatloaf. It was fine. Meatloaf is meatloaf. It was served with mashed potatoes and brocollini, also. Again, it was good. We also ordered the Mac n cheese. It was yummy! We ordered a side of asparagus. I must say, it was a rip off! For what they charge, the serving was minuscule, to say the least! It was more than disappointing. I don't appreciate being ripped off. We shared a  Creme brûlée for dessert. We enjoyed that a lot! Aside from the meager serving of asparagus for the price and the overcooked steak, dinner (and plenty of leftovers) were good. While we were eating dinner, I looked at the receipt. Every single item, except the salad, was marked ""To Go."" What I'd like to know is why we were charged an extra 30 cents for each item, INCLUDING THE PHONE CALL! What is that all about? I'm being charged extra because I'm getting food to go? I was in the restaurant business for 12 years. Seems to me, there are fewer costs for someone to order to-go compared to a party who dines in the restaurant. I understand there are containers and eating utensils to pack, but that's a lot cheaper than paying manpower needed to serve, cater to, and clean up after an in-store diner. On top of that, I'm still expected to tip, even though we cannot return an overcooked steak to have it prepared properly, or to complain about the measly portion of asparagus (I really find it hard to believe they would have served that portion to a dine-in customer), plus we have to clean up after ourselves. And who charges 30 cents for a to-go phone call??? Come on, guys!! Talk about nickel and dime-ing your customers!  It's the principle of the thing, fellas! Needless to say, that bummed us out. That is why we give Not Watson's three stars. A restaurant experience is not all about the food."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Krystal D.,"Denver, CO",4/28/2018,5.0,"Awesome! Went with my sister and nice and thought I'd sneak in an out of town review ;) 3pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was fairly busy. We were sat right away and greeted within 2 minutes. We decided to share a couple of appetizers and settled on fried green tomatoes, burger sliders, and a side of their onion rings. (The onion rings are not listed as a side), but I saw them pictured via Yelp and asked.....Okay.... the onion rings! I love beer battered onion rings and these did NOT disappoint! Our server was awesome and brought out their ""house sauce"" (spicy mustard/mayo) to dip them it. Such a great choice. The sliders were also delicious with carmelized onions, bacon, and  blue cheese crumbles (all amazing toppings)...and the fried green tomatoes were also, well....awesome! They were spicy and we couldn't tell if it was the pimento cheese, tomato jam, or their light batter...but either way they was great. All items were out in less than 15 minutes. We left feeling full and the service was pretty...well....yes... awesome! I recommended that my sister bring all of her out if town guest to this restaurant in  Market Square."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Brittany M.,"Athens, TN",2/25/2019,5.0,"I've been wanting to try Not Watson's for awhile and I'm glad we did. We visited on a week day and had a few kids in tow, as school was out. I was pleased when our server did not snub her nose at our kids, she was very friendly and patient. The menu has several southern favorites with a twist. We started with a couple appetizers, the portions were smaller with only enough for 2-4 people to share so glad we ordered a few. The friend green tomatoes and Philly cheesesteak egg rolls were our favorite. For entrees, we tried the strawberry salad, the wings, fish n chips, and chicken and waffles. Everything was fresh and delicious. The chicken and waffles had a different spin as the waffles had a spicy seasoning on them and the side dish of spiced watermelon was a super yummy surprise! It was not over powering but a nice touch. I will definitely visit again to try more dishes. The atmosphere was nice and the decor is trendy. The location is easy to find in the heart of Market Square."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mariliana V.,"Margate, FL",6/10/2018,4.0,"In the heart of Market Square. Great place for lunch! Great food.and reasonably priced, a big plus!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,CC W.,"Boston, MA",8/29/2019,5.0,Chose this spot for a downtown meal in Knoxville's Market Square based on other Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Location was fun and active. Service was quick and friendly. And food was better than you'd expect the first time you walk into bar with a restaurant. The fried pork belly tacos alone were worth the trip. Tasty and unforgettably good!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,John R.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7/20/2019,5.0,I love this place. It's delicious and I don't know what else to say. Great food and it's located in a great atmosphere in downtown Knoxville.  Keep up the good work. Parking and walking several blocks sucks just to get to it for a take out order.  It still gets 5 stars because the food quality is fantastic and that's what is most important.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jada Z.,"Knoxville, TN",7/16/2016,5.0,"Great spot to have a drink, bite to eat and perfect service. Friendly staff, great location, comfy atmosphere. Delicious food, great presentation. I had the Turkey Burger and it was awesome. Deviled eggs too!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Salmaan T.,"Washington, DC",10/26/2017,2.0,"I was at a 4 star but a 2 star experience today. Our waitress at lunch was awesome. Attentive, kind, professional. You can tell she cared about her tables and her work. Wish I could recall her name but she was outstanding today at lunch. Our food. My wife ordered a burger without jalapenos and with mac n cheese. Burger came with jalapenos and with fries. Also the patty was either for a kid's burger or the lunch special. Maybe 1/3 of an ounce, seemed more like 1/4. For a burger that should have been 1/2 a pound. I only care because I was charged for the 1/2 pound burger. My fish tacos were okay. I can't quite place which grocery store the processed shredded cheese was from. Hope this was a one time thing, way too many other good places to eat at in Market Square."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Salmaan T.,"Washington, DC",5/24/2015,4.0,Ordered 2 burgers to go. The market and Bleu cheese burgers. Savory bun and cooked exactly how I asked. Meat quality was great. One of the better burgers in knoxville. Will definitely be back.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Josh M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/11/2019,3.0,Meh. We were the only people in the restaurant which worries me right away. The food was just OK. Good service and beer selection.  Probably a nice stop after a night of drinking.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Fe Lixx D.,"Knoxville, TN",12/31/2016,4.0,Honestly overall this place has a good menu with matching food quality!Rib sliders are my favorite. I have had them several times without any disappointments! Keep up the good work everyone! Kudos
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Murray L.,"Franklin, TN",7/23/2019,5.0,In town for a business trip. The service was impeccable. The food was so good I went back the next night. Try the Pork Belly tacos they're the best in Tennessee. Great beer and wine selection.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Dr C.,"Sevierville, TN",5/15/2019,4.0,Very nice restaurant lots of different things to choose from service is pretty decent and so are the prices.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Alison P.,"Albany, GA",6/13/2019,5.0,"Came in late with a table of 6. They were so accommodating. Our food was great. I had the salmon and my son had the chicken and waffles. Both were fabulous. Our server was great, but I didn't get her name. Tuck delivered our food and he was a jewel. Great personality! Will definitely be back."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ansley M.,"University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN",9/21/2020,5.0,"This restaurant was delicious and good quality. they seem to have run out of certain options on the menu both times I've been there for dinner, but probably because they're busy!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tom G.,"Chandler, AZ",7/2/2019,4.0,"Good spot on a busy square.  Bartender was busy,  but provided great service.  He even had to to recommend a great beer.  Had the skirt steak for dinner.  Very good, especially the sauce,  but it did have a tough ""vein"" through it, however the the mashed potatoes were great and made the meal really good."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Elysia C.,"Jacksonville, FL",12/2/2017,4.0,"This place has one of the best burgers I've ever had. The location is perfect in Market Square. Layout was strange but works. We sat in the back which was fine with me. My daughter took me here for a quick lunch before we headed over to her apartment. I ordered the burger that comes with the fried egg and bacon with no bun and my daughter ordered the ol smokey burger. I was so excited when they let me substitute asparagus for the fries (for just a little extra).  Both were excellent, presentation was perfect and service was awesome. This will not be our last visit here. I could have stayed until happy hour!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sam B.,"Tucson, AZ",11/19/2017,5.0,"Very friendly staff.  A nice little front patio with a roof.  Many different types of burgers .  Also there are other menu options such as salad or a black bean burger.  I had the Ol'Smokey burger, absolutely delicious!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Bailey W.,"Nashville, TN",1/14/2018,5.0,"Y'all, I'm amazed anytime I can walk into a popular restaurant during prime brunch time, be seated right away and receive great service (hard to find where I live in Nashville). This was one of those places. We felt well taken care of and had a wonderful brunch. The Bloody Mary was wonderful and a steal at only $4. I had the veggie Bennie and my partner had the market Bennie, with a side of tater tots - we both practically licked the plate afterwards. Delicious! A great stop if you're hanging around market square!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kendra J.,"Macon, GA",3/7/2018,5.0,Service a QUICK AND EXCELLENT!! I mean everything was flavorful. Fries are very tasty. My husband enjoyed the wings and his good morning burger. Will be returning. I highly recommend it.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Danielle M.,"South Knoxville, Knoxville, TN",9/6/2020,5.0,Dylan was especially nice and quick with service. Went out of his way to accommodate my requests.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Katie H.,"Knoxville, TN",12/9/2017,4.0,"Came here for the first time last night and was not disappointed. Had a small wait, but it was worth it. I didn't even take any pictures, but all the pics posted here do it justice. I had the classic cheeseburger that came with cheddar, bacon, lettuce, pickles, and not sauce on a brioche bun. The burgers come with fresh cut fries which were awesome! Get a side of the not sauce to dip your fries in! I never eat a full meal when I go to dinner or make dinner at home, but I ate every last bite of this meal! Prices were good too. My boyfriend and I each got a burger with fries, a beer, and a glass of wine and our bill was only $36."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Vanessa N.,"Norcross, GA",5/8/2017,3.0,The food was good. I enjoyed my braised short rib sliders.  Service was good. What got me was the smell of the place. It sort of smelled like a restroom that was cleaned to hide the smell. If that made sense? Maybe we came at the wrong time but it was not pleasing.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Patrick O.,"Albuquerque, NM",2/21/2017,5.0,My Not Watson's dinner was the definition of a 5 star experience.  It was a busy Saturday night but we used Yelp to add ourselves to the list before we got there.  This worked and our wait was less than ten minutes.  Just enough time to get a beer at the bar before being seated.  We started with the sliders and the calamari and they were both excellent.  For my main I went with a burger and it was absolutely divine.  On top of all of this the service was fantastic and despite it being busy I felt we were taken very good care of.  It was an immensely pleasurable experience dining there.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Steve R.,"Old North Knoxville, Knoxville, TN",8/25/2019,5.0,"I consider myself a cheeseburger specialist!! I have eaten them many, many,many places across the country!! you want the best cheeseburger cooked to perfection with the greatest tasting fries or mashed potatoes, Go here!!I haven't tried anything else because they are so good!! They have many other options including healthy choices!!The service and staff is top notch excellent!!!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Schoberle A.,"Pensacola, FL",1/29/2018,5.0,"Outside of the wait, the food and drinks were amazing!  The restaurant was easily located , and thank goodness for the the waitlist attached to yelp!  I ordered a lemon drop martini that was delicious and I had the black and blu sliders was good! The best part of toy experience was the macaroni and cheese and Brussel sprout! If I had of known how phenomenal those two would be I would have just ordered two servings of that! If I come back to Knoxville I will definitely be back!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Vincent L.,"San Ramon, CA",10/2/2017,5.0,Everybody wants to be the one we rave about. This is one of the authentic ones. The beer selection is hearty but not overwhelming. The fried green tomatoes flooded our taste buds with waves of varying sensations. The chicken and waffles arrived with a fanfare of aroma and the promise of flavor assault. They delivered. We probably didn't scratch more than the surface of what this creative kitchen can deliver. We're bookmarking this place!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Dana M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/21/2019,3.0,"So really. What is wrong with Ricky? I've never seen a more apathetic, non-knowledgeable server. And on top of that his he's arrogant. Hoping our food comes out faster than the drinks. When we asked where those were, Ricky casually yelled across to the bar asking. Of course no one heard him or answered. He turned, smiled, and said 'They didn't answer'. I told him he was very helpful. Please god let dinner get better. 6-21-19 6:33 pm High top table. Update***Food is actually good!! Service is not. At all. 3rd time I've tried eating there. Just not good service at all."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Maria V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",8/13/2020,5.0,"Great place. Good service. Great food. I had the wedge, philly egg rolls, tuna app and the fried chicken."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Laura F.,"Boerne, TX",6/30/2018,4.0,"Visited Not Watsons twice in one week during the Destination Imagination Global Finals.  Both times I was impressed with the quality and freshness of the appetizers, burgers and fries/tots.  The fried green tomatoes rock and the sweet tea is tasty!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christine B.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",4/27/2019,3.0,"Burger was great chicken wings looked like they were neonates! Problems with management. Service was fine but our original server was told she couldn't serve us and when I said I wanted her to serve us, It was overturned by management. Not sure why they would do that. Odd situation that made me uncomfortable."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Terrell M.,"Navarre, FL",7/29/2019,4.0,"My first time at Not Watson's was AMAZING! The service was good and the wait was short. The Creole pasta was awesome. It had shrimp, chicken, and alligator. Great spot!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Don H.,"Walland, TN",3/18/2019,3.0,"The philly rolls are great, I had the  ribeye not impressed at all it had no taste. Also had the seared tuna on kale it was very good. The wait was about and hour and a half  and very crowded. If your hungry and expect to eat soon call ahead maybe. This place is upscale pricing without the upscale meal. My bill was 73 with a coke and 2 glasses of wine , philly steak rolls appetizer , ribeye steak And mahi,, tuna. I think they get so busy and just hurry making the food. Not so Watson was ,  not so good of an experience. My advice for them would be , do what you do and take the time to make the food right, people will always wait for something good."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Daria V.,"Vero Beach, FL",5/27/2020,5.0,Such great food and the place was awesome! Great character and definitely a must visit when in downtown Knoxville. Great atmosphere overall and top notch dishes. Everything we tried was outstanding.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Karyssa P.,"Corbin, KY",9/3/2018,5.0,"Their food is out of this world amazing and plated beautifully. I sat on the outdoor patio to get a view of market square. It's the prefect place for great food, and conversation. He staff was friendly, and the service fast. I'd recommend the Mahi Entree. I"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mike D.,"Knoxville, TN",4/7/2017,5.0,There's really not much to say.We've been here three times and the food is great. Every single time.It's not expensive. Though there are definitely places that are right nearby that aren't as good.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kurt F.,"Woodstock, GA",4/22/2015,4.0,"I frequent Knoxville on business, so I have tried most of the restaurants in town.  I decided on NotWatsons, since I've never been here and it was close to my hotel.I tried their ""Not so old fashioned"" and it was delicious and strong.  I had to have another.For dinner I started with a wedge salad and the deviled eggs.  Both were delicious and well portioned.   I had the fish and chips for an entree, it was pretty good, not terrible, but I'd try something new next time.They have a revolving menu for desert, I had a maple bacon cupcake just for fun, which was pretty good.Summary:  I would come back for the atmosphere and the food."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jimmy K.,"Cleveland, OH",7/14/2019,5.0,Our server Amanda recommended the Tuna sandwich.  Fantastic with a wedge salad.  My GF had the po'boy which was also very good.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Todd G.,"Staffordsville, KY",2/12/2017,5.0,Karly you were wonderful. Thank you for your suggestion- the double oak barrel tequila margarita was fabulous. Salmon too was terrific- my wife is a salmon snob. Wild Caught- is there any other way. The manager checked on us a couple of times - made us feel right at home. Thank you for a wonderful afternoon.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Michaelangelo A.,"Louisville, CO",4/8/2019,5.0,Great food! I highly recommend the philly potstickers and spicy burger with sweet potato fires. The founders port was awesome as well. My wife loved her blackened mahi mahi.  They need to add Pellegrino to the menu. The service was great as well...very friendly. Will continue to come here with friends and family.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Rich W.,"Huntersville, NC",4/28/2018,4.0,"Delightful lunch spot.  We arrived at the end if lunch rush, during an Arts Festival do downtown.  We were quite a 45 minutes wait, but it was actually 25 minutes.  We sat outside and soaked up the ambiance.  I had the wings and a wedge salad; my wife had the Strawberry salad.  The salalds - both - were very well-executed.  They did not just throw some vegetables together with a dressing; both were a well-thought out and executed dish.  The wings were meaty, tasty and presented well, with a decently hot chipotle sauce and a sprinkling of Bleu cheese on top.The wine and beers on tap scored as well.  Great service too.  We would definitely come back here!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Paige T.,"Knoxville, TN",9/18/2016,4.0,"The Cobb Salad is my favorite. The food is really good here and they have lots of beers on tap.I am happy with the service most times, but some days they seem to struggle."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lauren B.,"Caryville, TN",5/4/2019,3.0,"Well, my biggest issues was the taste of the food. I ordered a well done burger and got a medium burger. The fries tasted good but all in all I would say stock and barrel is better. The chili Mac and cheese burger was so messy and didn't taste that great and there weren't that many fries in the little basket they gave."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Anna J.,"Memphis, TN",1/21/2017,4.0,Ate here today (Saturday) for brunch around 1-2pm. The restaurant was moderately crowded but comfortable. Good service at the bar. Has two $4 mimosas and then the Market Bennie with country ham and fried potatoes. Mimosas were good and standard size - not too big. The Benedict was great! I finished it all. The hollandaise sauce paired very nicely with the salty country him. Just a pretty solid brunch.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Nick M.,"New Milford, NJ",6/11/2020,5.0,"Wow the food is amazing. The pork belly tacos appetizer was great. Also the steak and mashed potato's. Honestly the food should be more expensive here, due to the manager and wait staffs attentiveness and whoever is the chef. Just wow."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Denise M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6/17/2017,4.0,Ate at the bar here.  Service was ok.  Didnt get a real friendly vibe from the server bit maybe it was an off day.  The food was good.   Had the portobello mushroom sandwich with sweet potatoe fries.  Hubby had a gourmet dog. He said was good.  Drinks were tasty.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kendie L.,"Bardstown, KY",6/7/2019,5.0,Found this great restaurant on Market Square in Knoxville and took a chance.  The atmosphere was nice and the food was excellent.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Keegan J.,"Austin, TX",7/18/2020,5.0,Not Watson's is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Knoxville. Great location right in market square and such great food. Nothing but good things to say :)
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Shi Sofab C.,"Birmingham, AL",11/5/2017,5.0,"The Creole Pasta was amazing!! It was seasoned to perfection. While we waited on our food, we ordered calamari which was delicious as well. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and she enjoyed it. Definitely recommend Not Watson's Kitchen and Bar!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christina B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/9/2016,5.0,"I have been to Not Watson's a handful of times at this point, and every time has been without disappoint. This last time I had the veggie burger, and it was absolutely amazing.  Mind you, this is coming from someone who hardly ever eats veggie burgers as they are a staple in eating at non vegetarian houses.  I was worried about it being mushy, which is gross and honestly how a lot of ""in house made"" veggie burgers are.  I was pleasantly surprised how delicious and crispy it was, not mushy in the least!  Of course the staple of fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese on it are always an appetizer.  The fries here are amazing, even the next day.  I am always happy with my order and the awesome beer list with rotating drafts. The cocktails are amazing, and always great service. Not Watson's is my favorite on Market Square."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christina B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/22/2015,4.0,"I have visited Not Waton's twice and both times had a great meal and service.  First off, their appetizers all look amazing, so narrowing it down to one visit will be hard.  My favorite would have to be their friend green tomatoes with pimento cheese on top OOHHHH MYYYY LAAWWDDD its sooo goooooddddd.  Next up we have their deviled eggs, and yes hunty they good too. Their wedge salad would have to be my all time favorite, that included classic blue cheese but also balsamic on it !!! Genius and delicious! And if you are struggling with a side, do the asparagus, always do the asparagus- I don't know what kind of witchcraft is involved in making these, but I want MOOOAARR.  I have enjoyed their salmon, which was really good and also their amazing mix drinks, the kingsman being my favorite.  They also have a great selection of craft beer and 21 different kinds on draft.  I can't wait to go back to try everything else on this menu!Drink Specials:Every Monday is half price bottles of wine all dayEvery Tuesday is $3 pintsEvery Wednesday is $4 House Martini's Every Thursday is $5 House mojitos ( many flavors to choose from)"

The group shared a portobello mushroom sandwich, a buffalo chicken sandwich, fresh cut French fries and a wedge salad with Apple smoked bacon & blue cheese crumbles. Three local beers complimented the meal that could certainly be recommended...and Maizy had a biscuit to boot!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ashley B.,"Mesa, AZ",8/23/2016,5.0,"We're new here in Knoxville but came from Phoenix the land of amazing local restaurants so we've had a hard time finding places we like as much as back home but this place hit it out of the park! I ordered the chicken and cheddar waffles. I was skeptical of the cheese in my waffles but it was insanely good and came with so much chicken I couldn't even finish it. I'm already so excited to come back and stressing about what I'll order next time. My husband got the cheeseburger and fries and it was sooooo good. The fries were a little soggy so we assumed they'd disappoint but the flavor was insane! I almost ordered a whole other side of them because I wanted to steal them all. The burger was flavorful, great bun and perfect sauces. Plus it's local and grass fed which is always a plus. So happy we found this yummy spot!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tim Z.,"Rockford, IL",8/8/2017,3.0,"We stopped in for a later dinner at 8:15pm.  Our server was awesome! Kyle was very helpful and wiilling to share his opinion in with specific details.  We started with the  fried green tomatoes and brussel sprouts. The sprouts were seasoned and cooked perfectly to a nice crisp. They were fantastic! The tomatoes were good but a bit inconsistently made. The small amount of jelly is critical to balance the flavor of the dish.  Several of the four tomatoes had too much of the creamy spread and too little jelly which was applied in one small spot on the top or side. As served some bites were mediocre and a few bites were terrific. A little more time during the prep will help this dish.I had the Carpetbagger burger. I love exciting mixes of food but I think this one had too much going on and the flavors did not work well for me.  It was ok but not as good as I hoped. The fries were the leftover little overcooked  pieces like they ran out and did not want to make more.  My son's had the Old Smokey and Good Morning which they rated 3 out of 5. They were cooked correctly but were just not great.It took a while to get the food considering there were so few people in the restaurant, maybe we were too close to closing time.The prices were good and I would like to rate our meal as a 3.5 but I can't rate this a full 4."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sarah W.,"Murfreesboro, TN",8/4/2017,5.0,"Wings are the best we have had had in a long time. I ordered the Market burger with sweet potato fries and again the fries were so delicious!!! My hubby ordered the Carpetbagger with slaw and fried oysters to try something different and enjoyed it. I cannot wait to come back and try the chili Mac & cheese burger, short rib sliders and even save room for dessert. A must eat when you come to Knoxville! Loved the atmosphere and the server was good too!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Suzanne S.,"TN, TN",10/3/2017,5.0,"Excellent food and service!  We shared the fried pickles, wedge salad and the pork medallion entree.  Everything was so delicious!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jennie B.,"Chicago, IL",3/8/2015,3.0,"I LOVE farm to table restaurants. Whether I love their food or not, I still respect them for taking strides to help raise the level of consciousness when it comes to dining out and caring about animal welfare and human health.For some reason I had higher hopes for Not Watson's.  I had NOT read many reviews on Yelp, but I did read some of their story on Not Watson's website, and I was excited by their selection.We sat outside on a beautiful, sunny day.  I sat down before my 2 others.  The table was for 2, but we were 3, so I borrowed a chair from another table.  The waitress tried to take my drink order before my other 2 sat down.  I told her I was waiting for 2 more people, that we were 3, and I'll order something when they arrive.  She offered to bring water to start--great. I had to ask for a 3rd roll-up (napkin with silverware inside) and menu even though I told her we were going to be 3 people.  She brought 3 waters, my other 2 joined us, but she never took another drink order.  About 5 minutes later she took our order.  We all ordered the ('authentic' 9th Street) Philly cheesesteak after discussing details with her.  My mother grew up in Philadelphia and I've had many a fantastic Philly cheesesteak in my life!  I was SO excited to try this because the menu says:  The (sliced) meat's from Philly, the roll's from Philly, the cheese whiz is from Philly, the onions are from Georgia.  We asked if it was overstuffed, like I like my Philly cheesesteaks, and the waitress said, 'Yes--it's delicious!'The meals arrived less than 10 minutes later and sadly the cheesesteak looked sparse.  The meat was sort of fitting into the roll but not quite pushing the boundaries.  We couldn't find the cheese whiz so we immediately mentioned it.  The waitress offered to take it back for more cheese whiz. We also asked if they could throw in a little extra sliced meat and she obliged.  A couple minutes later she returned with a darn good looking sandwich!  The roll did seem authentic albeit a little soft.  I like my Philly cheesesteak rolls a bit warm & crispy on the outside while still soft on the inside. Maybe that's just me.  The meat, cheese, caramelized onions and cherry peppers were very good.  The fresh cut fries were another story.  They seemed kinda old.  Kinda stuck together, some were large and some were just random pieces thrown in.  The only reason I know there was something 'off' with our fries was because just before leaving I spotted the waitress serving another table 2 orders of fresh cut fries.  I just about stopped in my tracks and asked her if those were sweet potato fries because they looked phenomenal and completely different than ours! Nope. They were fresh cut fries. So much for consistency.Overall I think this place is OK, but I won't go home and dream about it at night.  Nor will I go back anytime soon, unless I'm dying to eat on Market Square, outside, and there is no other open table.  I think I'll continue trying new places before I return."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Danielle R.,"Annapolis, MD",7/5/2017,5.0,"Started with the Not-Cho Libre nachos...big mistake. They were so delicious that we ate all of them and ended up barely eating our dinners. I ordered the Not Yo Mama's Chicken and Waffles which came with seasoned watermelon. While I wasn't a fan of the watermelon, my daughter was and ate every last bit. The fried chicken and waffles were killer and I wish I could have finished them! The location is great too! Market Square is so much fun!"

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Elizabeth H.,"Saint Simons Island, GA",3/5/2019,5.0,Fun vibe. Veggie portabella sandwich was perfect after a long day of travel. Kyle was attentive and super friendly while juggling a packed bar. I hope my travels bring me back again.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kate G.,"Knoxville, TN",2/29/2020,3.0,I have had mixed experiences at Not Watson's. The food is pretty good but not the best for what you're paying. The service has been bad when I have gone. I am a local and have no plan on going back.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Steven B.,"Central Business District, New Orleans, LA",4/22/2019,3.0,Pork belly taco..awesome. bourbon tasting..great. blue cheese carmelized onion burger great. Cheese steak egg rolls...yum yum. Service was not very good.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Douglas W.,"Knoxville, TN",4/12/2016,3.0,"Not Watson's is nestled in the heart of Knoxville's downtown area, Market Square, and is great place for a casual Saturday lunch. Not Watson's is located in the olde Watson's department store location and the owners have paid homage to Knoxville's great heritage by naming it as such. Check out their website for a delightful story regarding the naming of the restaurant. The restaurant is a fun dinning experience with a great menu. The decor and atmosphere give off a relaxed vibe. The bathroom was clean but there were hand towels strewn about. Despite this the restaurant was very clean.The hostesses were very accommodating with us and our finickiness of our seating preferences. Our waiter was attentive but aloof. It seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but there, that day.To begin the meal we had an order of Not Your Grandma's Deviled Eggs and the Shrimp Ceviche. The smoked trout roe on the deviled eggs was a nice twist on a classic dish and the avocados on the ceviche was very fresh. The shrimp was well prepared and the freshly made tortilla chips were warm and delicious. For the entrée I had The Carpetbagger burger. The burger was topped with a fried oyster and a spicy remoulade, which was exceptional. The dishes I had were all original and tasty. I enjoyed my meal and will plan another trip to Not Watson's in my immediate future."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kat M.,"Knoxville, TN",11/15/2017,5.0,"The chicken and waffles are the best in town!They take a slightly different approach to the southern dish by doing a savory cheddar waffle, boneless fried chicken that's easy to eat, and a bourbon maple syrup. It's an amazing combo of flavors. Compared to a lot of the places to eat in Market Square, it doesn't get terribly crowded (usually). The drinks are also good and the wait staff has always been great."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lindy Y.,"Brentwood, TN",11/16/2018,5.0,"Went there before the UT game, great burger, waffles, and mimosas weird combo but if you split it, it makes a great meal."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Adam R.,"Columbus, OH",5/24/2018,5.0,Stopped in while visiting the area. It's a good thing I am just visiting or I think I would be here everyday just to have this flatiron kale Caesar. It was amazing. Service was great. Patio was also a nice spot to sit and listen to the live music on the adjacent plaza.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tammy H.,"Smyrna, TN",4/25/2017,5.0,Got the creole pasta and it was really good. The server was very attentive and did not keep me waiting on anything. Service was friendly. Atmosphere was nice and calm. Music not too loud or obnoxious. Would return to this place in the future. Drink menu looked good but didn't try any drinks on this trip.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Wendy C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/9/2016,4.0,"The place has a very relaxed and  welcoming vibe.  Nice staff, easy going and attentive.  The food was incredible. I have never had better mashed potato in all my life, and mash is my thing, I always order it when available. The chicken and waffles that my husband had was enough to make Knoxville and famous destination in itself.  The salt and peppered watermelon went so well with it, who knew?!  My flat iron steak dish was superb.  We had a large group and everyone ordered different things and we all really enjoyed our meals. Lots of nice things were said by everyone. I heard the salmon pasta dish was delightful.   My husband ordered a gin cocktail and he said was very well made.  I love the nice tall and round wine glasses and the huge coffee cups too.  This is my new favorite restaurant. I need to come back and try everything on the menu."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Eric B.,"Bethesda, MD",1/26/2016,4.0,"Pretty good. Wings were recommended by concierge at hotel and they were no disappointment. The only thing they lacked was piping hotness. Very good simple buffalo sauce, pretty crisp, good size, fresh/juicy, but not all that hot temp wise. I'm assuming they're cooked ahead, and fired again for 3-4 before getting sauced and plated. Which is fine, really, but I like the wings to come out hotttt!Burger was pretty darn good. And if my only criticism would be that there was nothing all that inspiring about it, I would be forced to admit that the meat quality was noticeably above par. The flavor of the burger - standing completely independent of bun and fixings - was fresh, light (not a homogenized, flat, meat disk), and delicious.Only disappointment was the onion rings, but I can't pin the fault entirely on the chef. When they hit the table, I thought they were grease-logged, but it seems the culprit was a very, very watery yet abundantly flavorful and fresh onion. Despite interfering with the batter's crispness, and creating a pretty wet onion ring experience, a huge bite of these things was still yummy.I'm going out on a limb to say this is one place where not everything on the menu is dressing up the cheap ingredients. Freshness and quality - even to the detriment of execution, and standard technique. Good experience overall."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Savanah D.,"New Shoreham, RI",12/31/2019,5.0,My absolute favorite place to eat and enjoy a good brew in downtown Knoxville. The ahi tuna sandwich is amazing for and never disappoints!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Savanah D.,"New Shoreham, RI",4/15/2019,5.0,My absolute favorite place to eat and enjoy a good brew in downtown Knoxville. The ahi tuna sandwich is to die for and never disappoints!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Chris G.,"Memphis, TN",6/11/2018,5.0,"I never write reviews, but was compelled tonight. Incredible experience. Kyle (bartender), despite the amount of customers, treated me like I was the only one there. Volunteered (no pun intended - UT) to replace my steak, that came out too early. Also replaced my Weller, that was mistakenly cleaned up. Can't wait to come back. Thanks Kyle!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Leah S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/24/2019,5.0,"My friend and I went there for the first time last night. We originally were trying to go to stock and barrel, but there was an hour wait... so we went to Not Watson's BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED! They seated us right away, our waitress was absolutely amazing! I can't remember her name but she hair red hair. The food was delicious and reasonably priced too! I had the intention of saving half of my food to eat at a later time but I just couldn't stop!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Thao T.,"Hendersonville, TN",1/15/2016,4.0,"Not Watson's name is so odd I actually cringed a little when I saw their sign for the first time.....Anyways, we came here as a group of 10 for Marz's bday and service was awesome. We had Sam and he kept waters refilled and somehow remembered all the random orders we were yelling out and got all the checks right on the first try! Beers could've been colder :(( but their Not So Old Fashioned was soOoO good!! The mojitos were light and refreshing as well, not toooo sweet.We shared a few appetizers. The fried pickles were my favorite. They're spears rather than little slices! Which I fell in love w immediately.I really don't understand the concept of unripe tomatoes but everyone else said the fried green tomatoes were *amazing* as well.I got the portabella sandwich and mac and cheese as my side. The melted Brie on the sandwich was sooo goood, but the bread was overwhelming for the size of the mushroom. /:The mac and cheese was bland... it looked like it was drowning in velveeta. Lolll. I also had some sweet potato fries, which were perfectly crispy and slightly salty. There were dramatic high and low notes but overall it was a fun dinner. Nice environment for a group outing."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kate P.,"Greensboro, NC",1/3/2017,4.0,"My boyfriend makes every decision very...carefully so we had been scanning menus in Market Square for a while on a Monday evening when a young woman working in Not Watson's noticed and opened the door to invite us in. I'm so glad she did!Decor was really neat, include the little room where all the kegs were. Service was average, no complaints. The flat-iron steak with chimichurri though...amazing. My boyfriend dove into my mashed potatoes right away based on smell alone & I had to keep swatting him away. Broccolini would've been the best thing on the plate anywhere else. Loved the whole thing. Boyfriend got chicken & waffles and didn't seem to love them, hence the four stars. Dipped in the bourbon maple syrup, I thought the chicken was pretty darn tasty but it wasn't as outstanding as the steak. Highly recommended!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Matt C.,"Maryville, TN",4/2/2016,4.0,"Another hit in Market Square! The whole fam squeezed into a both and enjoyed this joint. Large menu with something for everyone. Between the 6 entrees we ordered-silence once served, meaning great food!! I plan to return for the alligator po boy. Worth a stop when in the square"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Richard T.,"Knoxville, TN",12/19/2017,5.0,This is one of my favorite places on Market Square. Working at the Ice rink....I'm their almost daily. They have the best chili and grilled cheese ever!!! All their soups are delicious. I love their burgers and phillies too. The staff has always been courteous and efficient. If you have not been here you are missing out!!!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Shawn K.,"Winter Garden, FL",10/18/2016,5.0,So glad I stopped in here. Kyle was great at the bar and the food was really special. The chicken and waffles is the end game....crazy good.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Zeenat S.,"Warwick, RI",11/26/2015,5.0,"They serve creekstone beef! The quality of the burger is phonomenal. I have tried the pretty hot burger and the Parisian. I am a big fan of Brie cheese so I thought the Parisian tasted great. I have heard from other friends the ribs taste good.  Since I don't eat pork I can't really compare those ribs with beef ribs. Nonetheless I really need to try the ribs next time I go. As a side, get the sweet potato fries. They are perfectly fried and taste just right. I think this place is probably one of the best burger places in Knoxville."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kimberly P.,"Knoxville, TN",1/12/2019,5.0,"One of our favorite restaurants in Knoxville. Always delicious, great atmosphere for date night or for family. We love to sit outside when we get the chance. Our favorites are the Mahi Mahi dish, sweet potato fries, and the Pork Belly tacos."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Rickey E.,"Fort Sanders, Knoxville, TN",2/22/2020,5.0,"Fantastic everything!!!! Food, drinks, and people! Certainly a must go to spot in the downtown area of Knoxville if not all of the city. It offers trendy music, TVs and good vibes. I saw people dancing in their seats and heard plenty of laughter. Dishes that were order were both presented beautifully and delicious. Drinks were on point and my server was outstanding. Thanks for the wonderful experience, which will have me coming back for more."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Wesley L.,"Philadelphia, TN",11/15/2015,3.0,"We had just come from the homecoming game vs North Texas and were hungry. I suggested Stock & Barrel, but they already had a line out the door. I had never been to Not Watson's and The Boy had expressed a burger Jones.We were promptly seated and greeted by a server. She was of Hispanic origin, yet had no trouble with our local accentuation. She took our drink orders while we perused the menu. Shortly, two Diet Cokes and a Yazoo Sue appeared. We ordered:-The fried pickle appetizer-Young bride; Ole Smokey burger (w/fries)-The Boy; The Carpetbagger (w/fries)-Me; The Chili-Cheese Dog (w/fries)We evaluate the meal thusly:The fried pickles were good and the remoulade sauce was fresh, but there was not enough for the number of pickle spears in the order. They came out later than they should have (only about 5 minutes before the main course) but that was not a server issue, as they were piping hot.My young bride's burger - ordered medium well - actually medium. She said that the flavor and quality of the beef was quite good and the bun was very high quality.The Boy's burger - ordered medium - came out medium-rare, so both were just slightly under-cooked. He also gave the flavor and quality high marks.My dog was monstrous and perfect. Just enough of each ingredient so that all I needed to add was mustard to my own taste.The only real issue with the meal was the fries. They were - in our group opinion - greasy and limp. When picked up, they flopped over consistently. We all felt that they should have been double-fried in the Bobby Flay style to make them crispier. Also, they should have been drained better to allow more of the cooking oil to disperse. A minor issue also, the Diet Coke was inadequately carbonated. That's a mechanical problem that probably had not been discovered by the staff.On the flip side, our service was exemplary. The server smiled every time she showed and was courteous and pleasant overall. I won't refuse to go back, but it can wait, The next time I'll try something that comes minus the fries, or try one of the other sides."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Crystal L.,"Owingsville, KY",5/1/2018,5.0,"I had the fish and chips. The fish was crispy as was the fries. When my plate arrived, I was disappointed and thought the fries were burnt, but they weren't. They had an excellent flavor. I added a bit of malt vinegar over them and devoured them. The cole slaw had the best flavor. It had a unique flavor that reminded me of possibly lime. It was creamy, but light. I loved it. Service was a bit slow, but the whole restaurant was pretty steady with customers in and out."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,A S.,"Manhattan, NY",9/30/2019,5.0,Tried with the family as we passed through Knoxville for 1 night. We selected this restaurant based on Yelp reviews and we thought it was excellent. I had the cheesesteak with brief cheese which was excellent. The meal was tasty and the service was top notch. Really great find.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lance R.,"Valparaiso, IN",8/18/2015,4.0,This was an excellent place with great food and the waffles and chicken outstanding. They had a nice selection of bourbon and scotch and wonderful service. By the way it's not Watsons because the owners mom was a fanatic for a department store called Watsons and the kids would go NOT Watsons when asked where they wanted to go.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jennifer B.,"Mobile, AL",10/22/2018,5.0,This is the best service I've ever had!  I had a not so Cobb salad with crispy chicken.  The manager thought the chicken was too crisp so he brought me new chicken strips on a plate. I thought they were fine but that is just excellent customer service!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Amy L.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2018,5.0,"I have only been here for brunch, but was definitely not disappointed! They have delicious drinks to go along with the food. It's right in the middle of market square so it's nice to walk around the farmers market during the summer then grab some brunch there. I have always had great servers who are very attentive."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mark R.,"Garland, TX",11/28/2015,4.0,"This place isn't crowded but has about as good a burger as Stock and Barrel.  I ordered a cheeseburger medium rare with fries.  I tried the onion rings and they were probably the best I had in Knoxville. If you want quiet and smaller crowd do ""Not Watsons"" if you want a noisy crowded experience do Stock and Barrel, the burgers are about the same, IMHO."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Latecia H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/2/2018,5.0,"Great burgers and delicious fries. I'll be dining here again soon to try other menu options. Nice atmosphere and right in the center of Market Square, where there's always something fun happening."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mireya R.,"Maryville, TN",2/26/2017,4.0,"This was our first time trying his place out. I ordered a burger and it was very good, very juicy. The bread it was paired with made it extra good. The sweet potato fries were delicious. I liked the outside seating area, and our server was pretty nice. The only reason I took a star off was their cocktails. The pineapple drink was way too sweet and the grapefruit mule was extra spicy. Nothing like a regular Moscow mule. Other than that i would recommend it."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,David S.,"Dallas, TX",6/7/2016,4.0,"Very good variety on the menu, great service. A bit overpriced in my opinion, but everywhere is anymore LOL. I had the fried oysters appetizer, it was good. The burgers are huge and delicious. I'm not a drinker but the bar has a huge variety of beers on tap. Located right in Market Square, so what could be better than that?"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Erica B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/23/2018,5.0,"Dropped in here on a busy Saturday. Service was wonderful, and the food was amazing. It's got a great vibe, too!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,RJ P.,"Johnson City, TN",5/15/2017,5.0,"This is our go-to place for consistently great food and service. This being the case, it gets fairly busy sometimes, but even so I've always received fast, friendly service.Brunch is always incredible. And you MUST try the blue-cheese sliders on the appetizer menu!!!!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Justine R.,"Oak Ridge, TN",8/12/2018,5.0,Not Watson's is a wonderful place with tasty food. I enjoy my meal every time I go there! My favorites are the black bean burger and the veggie powder wrap. Each time I go I request for my server to be Gavin as he is cute as a button and gives great service! Everyone go and make Gavin your waiter and you won't regret it!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tim C.,"Newton, KS",5/27/2016,5.0,"One of the best restaurants I've been to. The chicken and waffles were amazing and the service from Marcus, our waiter, was even better. If we were local this would be out new spot for friends and family."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tiara B.,"Atlanta, GA",8/8/2018,5.0,"Everytime I come to Knoxville I come here. This is the place I go to unzip my pants halfway and eat until I feel sick, yet surprisingly elated. Love the food here. Gotta talk about the building first. I really like the set up, whether you want to sit outside to view the bustling Market area or sit inside with the bright colors and lively ambience, they are really giving a great time either way. I always love my service here also. They have some awesome burgers; I have had the Spicy burger (forgot the name) and one of the non-meat bean burgers. The bean burger is SLAMMIN! They have something here for many tastes. Also, try the fried green tomatoes. I am a country girl and have had many different experiences with FGTs, but these are so hearty and sinfully delicious."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Steven H.,"MD, MD",5/2/2016,4.0,"Fun place, great atmosphere, and good food. I especially like the fried green tomatoes. I thought the alligators po boy were too chewy but it SAS interesting to try."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Shannon C.,"Scott Air Force Base, IL",7/10/2018,5.0,Great food and kid-friendly menu! Liked the atmosphere although the hosted area seemed more like a social gathering. A little distracting but the overall experience was great!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,L F.,"Nashville, TN",9/11/2019,5.0,"We went on Knoxville's First Friday and sat outside. This was entertaining in itself. I had a first for me--chicken and waffles. Husband had the pork porterhouse. Oh my, fabulous. Call an hour before and get seated immediately. A great experience."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,John M.,"Henrico, VA",3/7/2018,4.0,"What a nice little place on Market Square. Went there on a Sunday night. Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, but I was able to grab drinks at the bar. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were perfectly sized. So often the prices are high, and you get too much food. I was there for the weekend so couldn't take food with me. I got the Flat Iron steak with Chimichurri sauce. It came with a side of mashed red potatoes. Just perfect. The Ahi Tuna appetizer was also amazing. Had quite the kick and large enough for dinner if you are not starving."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Chelsi H.,"Joelton, TN",3/17/2016,5.0,"Best burger I have had in a long time! Cooked to a perfect juicy medium, great fresh veggies and balanced flavor! Got the Ol' Smokey and would order again for sure. Fries were hand cut and awesome, just a tad salty, but good with the house made ranch (huge plus is real ranch!) Great service and welcoming vibe!Second visit, next night was not as good as first time. I got the burger with the fried egg on top and was so disappointed that it was over hard, tried to explain my disappointment to the waitress but there seemed to be a language barrier. Rest of food was good, but left disappointed from previous night experience. Service and that over hard egg were disappointing. Third visit, 1 month later: had a GREAT waiter, Frank. Took his recommendation on the fish and chips and LOVED it! Excellent crunchy batter, not greasy. Fish was firm and fresh, not mushy at all. Good coleslaw and tarter sauce (which I'm usually not a fan of) but I ate both. Husband had the alligator Po'Boy and other than a small amount of gator, he liked it. He said the sauce was really spicy and tasty. Excellent service again."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Shilpi S.,"Cary, NC",1/14/2016,4.0,"This wasn't our first choice because when you open Yelp Stock and Barrel seems to be dominating the dinner scene. So on a rainy night we all walked there and the place was too busy for 4 of us. So we walked to Not Watson'd Kitchen + Bar which wasn't busy but welcoming for sure. The decor was clean and eclectic. Our server took our order of drinks (Interesting cocktails!!)  and gave us time to look at the menu. Our order of Fried Green tomatoes, Wings and Oysters came in pretty quickly. Oysters were great and Fried Green tomatoes were hands down winner for me because of Pimento Cheese. the portion sizes were good so we only had room for one entree between all of us. Chicken and waffle was the unanimous decision. Well i stay away from mixing those two together but it was probably wise to try here because those along with bourbon infuse maple syrup were divine. Despite being really full we polished the whole thing off. Apart from great food, Watson's  have good vibe, music and spot on service too. I will definitely go back for more of that syrup and waffles and of course fried chicken."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Justin E.,"Meridian, ID",6/4/2015,5.0,"I had a delicious bacon Bloody Mary to go with my bacon burger. The waitress was a delight and the food was great. It was busy and felt fun but it wasn't too noisy! That's really all I have to say! Nothing went wrong, there was no aspect of the restaurant that turned me off, and my friend had a good meal too. It's a clean jazzy looking place. We sat at a booth and it was cozy! That's all! That's all I got! And this picture!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,David C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/3/2018,3.0,I have nothing good or bad to say about my visit here.  I had the seared tuna sandwich and the wife had the chili cheese burger.  Her burger was ehhh and my tuna was ehhhh.  That being said the person by us got the philly and it looked amazing.  Maybe next time.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Justin C.,"Coatesville, PA",2/3/2016,4.0,"Fun atmosphere and pleasant staff. We were passing through Knoxville on our way south and stopped here for dinner. The chicken and waffles are a must order, so tasty the breading on the chicken was heavenly. Owner stopped by and chatted with us for a bit. Would return next time we are in town!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Melinda R.,"Reston, VA",10/14/2018,3.0,"Veggie bennie was good.  Burger was just average.  Prices were great.  Service was particularly slow.  Took 10 mins for drinks on a slow Sunday afternoon.  Food took about 25 mins to arrive.  Bill was overcharged,  but they fixed it.  Nothing special."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Adriana H.,"Brentwood, TN",9/15/2017,5.0,"Ok so I'm very picky when it comes to meat. On top of that I have allergies so I can only eat turkey burgers or chicken. My friends and I checked out this place upon happenstance and let me tell you. BEST TURKEY BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD. Turkey burgers are known for being dry but this was totally opposite. So juicy, great flavor. I crave this burger most days. A must try in my book."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lauri M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/2/2019,4.0,"We had lunch here during the Dogwood Sidewalk Art show.  The wait was long due to the crowds but the staff was very nice.  We were seated outside and enjoyed people and dog watching while we waited.  The food was very good and the waitress was wonderful.  I recommend trying it, we will go back."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,John M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/4/2015,4.0,"Just stopped in for drinks, but will go back to dry the dinner menu. The ambiance is nice, but the music is a little loud if you're looking for an intimate dinner for two or something. Probably would be a good place for dinner with friends. Tried several drinks and they were all really good: dixie carter, the Watson, and the kingsman. The Kingsman was probably the overall favorite."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Brooks B.,"Atlanta, GA",1/28/2018,4.0,"Three words: sweet potato fries. This is a great burger and fries joint! They also have some pretty good fries. Plus every time I've gone there, they make some pretty good (and strong) drinks! Definitely a good spot to drop into."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Deron B.,"Columbus, OH",4/17/2018,5.0,"High quality, very unique restaurant with great atmosphere, great food and great service. I highly recommend the Philly Cheese egg rolls and sandwiches as well as the chicken and waffles."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sarah P.,"Knoxville, TN",3/14/2015,4.0,"My sister and I tried Not Watson's for the first time this evening, and I must say, it's pretty tasty. I had the fish and chips, which were some of the best I have had in Knoxville. The cod was perfectly breaded and cooked, and the fries were hand cut, which really amped up the dish. There was live music in the Square tonight, and patrons seemed to be taking refuge from the drizzly weather inside restaurants. I assume this was part of why it was so busy, although since I've never been, it's possible that this is common at Not Watson's. Regardless of the crowd, we received great service. All in all, Not Watson's seems to really stack up to the competition in Market Square. Not an easy feat!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Andy B.,"White House, TN",9/14/2015,5.0,"I'm strictly giving this place a 5 star review because I'm obsessed with cheesesteaks and they have a good one here with Amoroso Rolls.  That is the key.  I ordered mine with white american AND whiz because I like it extra cheesy.  I will say that I found this place on Yelp! to plan a stop on a road trip and this was on the way.  I stopped on my way to Bristol and on my way back to Nashville, and the first steak was much better simply because it had plenty of steak.  My second steak on the way back  was a little skimpy."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jody C.,"Knoxville, TN",1/13/2015,4.0,"This place is pretty great. Their burger meat is not quite as good as Stock and Barrel, but I love the options for the burgers. Best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Plus, they have tater tots on the menu! That's a small thing, but I dig it. Had a few of the entrees, and they are well-prepared, flavorful, and a good price. Their desserts are pretty fantastic too.As for the service. I've been going since literally day one. They've gotten a ton better. Sure you'll have bad service every once in a while. But I also watched a waitress keep her composure while one of my friends was being a complete piece of crap. For that, I gave her a bigger tip."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Robert F.,"Gray, TN",3/1/2018,3.0,"Nice place with a decent menu. My wife and I ate dinner here on a weeknight and enjoyed the appetizer and drinks more than the main course. I had the ribeye and she had the salmon, they both were good but nothing to write home about."

Only comment I have is order more biscuits for Sunday brunch! Chicken and waffles was def on point; but I wanted biscuits gravy chicken and all the fixings."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ellin G.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",8/12/2017,5.0,So we visited here for the first time with a party of 11. The waiter was so very attentative. Also the best burger I have had in a long time. Every child cleared their plate too. Great atmosphere and good classic music.

I got a burger and was cooked as I requested. It wasn't anything spectacular but I loved the sweet potato fries! This is the kind of place that has a pretty big/overwhelming menu, great for pleasing a large group of people."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Don E.,"Waxhaw, NC",7/7/2019,5.0,Great and inventive brunch menu. $4 mimosas and Bloody Marys. Name comes from the Watson's department store which used to be in the building. Would definitely recommend.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sam F.,"Market Square, Knoxville, TN",9/2/2019,1.0,Takes for ever for not that much food. Messed up our waters and put soda water in it. Burgers just mediocre waffles and chicken pretty bad and the service is so slow you can nap and finish a harry potter book. Messed up our receipts over charged on the wrong items. Do not expect much ....
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sam P.,"Knoxville, TN",8/19/2016,5.0,"I've had almost every burger on the menu at this point, and I've yet to be disappointed by any of them.My favorite has to be the pretty hot burger or the portabello mushroom sandwich.  Both are packed with flavor!I'm happy they offer sweet potato fries as an alternative to normal fries as well.  It's nice to switch it up every once in a while.Service is always great, everyone always seems to be having a great time and enjoying their jobs."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Boy H.,"Knoxville, TN",5/10/2017,2.0,"**1/2 STARS:  I had burgers and fries along with a couple of IPAs.  The burgers are actually fabulously juicy with great flavors.  The fries had potential, seemingly fresh cut.  The problem with the fries likely had more to do with them being allowed to sit under a heat lamp for too long rather than them being served immediately.  I highly recommend instructing your wait-staff to present the food as soon as prepped--esp. the fries (if you desire them hot). Otherwise, you might be served cold, soggy fries.  Next time I visit, I will certainly send the food back; this time we were in too much a hurry... to go see STS9 in concert (highly recommended as a must see band).OK, I went back to give them a second chance.  My experience left me with no choice but to decrease their rating to just 2 stars, and that might be generous.  This time I ordered the ""pretty hot burger"" @ medium well along with sweet potato fries.  My wife ordered a salmon/kale salad.  Starting with the positive, my fries were warmer this time around...  not hot mind you, but warmer than the first time around.  However, the burger was completely over cooked to the point it was hard, dry and chewy. Speaking of chewy, the bun's texture was as if microwaved--it tore like a pretzel such that it required pulling the bite off as if beef jerky.  My wife's salad was in a word, ""forgettable"".  The meat was cooked to her liking (somewhat raw in the center) but the greens consisted mostly of Brussels sprouts (not kale).  She noted that it tasted like a bag salad sold at Costco... not to knock Costco, we are big fans.  However, we aren't interested in paying $50 for a meal we can prepare from home, purchased at Costco, at $10."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Karen D.,"Cleveland, TN",9/24/2017,5.0,"Amanda was an exceptional server on a very crowded Sunday.  Our food was delicious, hot, fresh and plentiful. See the photos:). This is located in Market Square which is filled with many different restaurants, sidewalk shops and musicians, a water play fountain, tall trees and history.  My husband is the pickiest of eaters and requested to leave out any hot/spicy flavors on his pasta, and he enjoyed his meal.  I've been on a healthy eating program for several months, and the Salmon Kale salad fit with my dietary needs.  The Salmon was cooked perfectly and was thick and tasty.  My son loved his Fried Chicken and waffles.  He had difficulty deciding between that and the pork loin medallions with Mac & cheese and grilled asparagus. The couple by us had brunch, and the French Toast was stacked high.  The burgers that we saw were thick and presented well.  The menu had much variety and everything looked delicious.  We saw the scallop appetizer, and the scallops were large and plentiful.  The bar is large and has large TVs tuned to sports."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,GD C.,"Oak Ridge, TN",8/11/2019,3.0,"Went on a Saturday evening and had about a 15 min wait for a table, less than the front desk's estimate so that's a plus.  They don't automatically drop straws on the table; one of the rare things we were ahead of the times was not using straws at restaurants (we don't at home and we trust them to wash the forks so why not the cups) even before microplastic waste was a public issue.  There are several TV's with sports and the indoor seating area was a bit loud for conversation.  Service was efficient.The Good Morning (applewood bacon and fried egg) burger was a hit and the substitution of sweet potato fries for regular french fries was also a positive.  The strawberry salad was OK, the fried goat cheese an interesting addition.  The fish in the fish and chips were round puffy spheres which was interesting but when you cut it some of the fish would fall out of the batter ball.  The regular fries weren't anything special and the cole slaw disappointingly plain.We don't often get downtown but would be fine with visiting again, though we likely would try one of the others first for comparison."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,L T.,"Pawcatuck, CT",10/17/2017,4.0,Visiting family in Knoxville & they brought us here. What a fun restaurant- delicious burgers & breakfast- everyone was satisfied. I'd definitely visit again.

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,L B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2015,2.0,"3 visits since they opened- 1 visit last month hoping for improvements over time The fried green tomatoes perhaps set the bar too high for the rest of the menu.  They were the favorite of all the diners in my parties- the other dishes are very mediocre in comparison.  Very loud if you are in the mood for that -  the drinks were all well done though the staff does seem a bit ""relaxed"" rather than attentive"

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tara S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/14/2014,2.0,"Over all I did not experience anything that leaves me feeling compelled to return. I will say, I hope that is all due to new restaurant glitches, however they've kind of been open too long for that excuse. First, when we walked in , the hostess, and a waitress who was looking at the books, looked up, met our gaze, and stared at us. Finally the hostess said"" can I help you with something?"". Maybe I sound snarky and old-fashioned but what happened to a friendly greeting from the hostess? Also....we both know what you can help me with. Finding a seat! I am not a census taker, I am hungry! Anyway, we were then seated quickly. I have to compliment the effort put into the remodel - it is soooo much lovelier than the former restaurant which inhabited the space. The bar is lovely, lighting is good.  They had some pretty good wine and beer so we started with drinks. Our server wasn't unable to use the wine tool, so there was a bit of slamming around the table and the cork ended up broken in two with bits in the bottle. Our server was sweet and apologetic, however when we looked over the food menu she checked back every minute or so, which made us feel rushed.The menu seemed enticing in some ways and confusing in others. For example, there were dishes that featured a component which was not available on its own -like an appetizer with bbq pulled pork or something, when pulled pork was not offered elsewhere. This makes me think the pork isn't cooked or smoked in house, because it seems like something awesome to offer if you're making it fresh! We each ordered a burger. They were pretty good, the burger buns were great. We had to wait for long expanses of time to get things that we asked for or were forgotten; the service was very hot and cold. I think I will go again and sit at the bar and maybe have an appetizer to see if things have improved; i hope the best for them but things were just not in sync on my dinner visit."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sara K.,"Charlotte, NC",8/17/2017,5.0,"This place was cool and my burger was perfect. Large beer selection and every employee we dealt with was super friendly. Really enjoyed it and will be going back, soon."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Eric S.,"San Francisco, CA",8/12/2017,5.0,"My favorite downtown/market square restaurant out of the vast selection available. Delicious American dishes for whatever you're in the mood for, but I can't get over their burgers which are among the best I've ever had - there is no way to underestimate the full gravity of that statement, I love me a good burger everywhere travels take me. This spot is a must try for those staying downtown for business, visiting downtown Knoxville, or locals trying to find something new (if you're like me, you've already heard about it from work/church/neighborhood). I definitely recommend giving this place a try, even if you've stopped trying downtown locations for a while."

I'd seen Not Watson's on a previous trip was impressed with the menu. One of my coworkers was on an extremely limiting diet, and Not Watson's was not only accommodating for her, but also had many options for the rest of the party. I had the ribeye with asparagus & a small portion of the white cheddar mac n cheese. It was DELICIOUS! The steak was cooked to perfection! As an appetizer, I had the wedge salad, which was HUGE, but equally delicious. There is also a great beer/wine/cocktail menu. Frank was our server and he made sure that our glasses stayed full, and that our orders were right. I'm definitely keeping Not Watson's on my list for future trips to Knoxville."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jean H.,"Wellington, FL",7/5/2019,1.0,"Old tasting fish, disgusting french fries, burger tasted like rotten red meat and was black on a cold bun, and the scallops tasted like dirty grill.  Pretty gross and wait time from the time we ordered and to get our food for a party of 4, was over an hour.  Nice server and manager but disappointing food."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Rachel B.,"Orlando, FL",4/6/2018,4.0,"One of my favorite places I visited when in Knox recently. The drinks are strong and the fried green tomatoes were AMAZING!!!

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Amy K.,"Knoxville, TN",10/11/2016,2.0,"Tried this place for the 1st time on the recommendation of several friends.  The calamari appetizer was just ok, not the best not the worst. I ordered the pork medallions which came with asparagus and white mac & cheese.  My medallions were cooked to the point of shoe leather which might be why there was so much sauce you couldn't taste anything else.  white mac & cheese was bland, no flavor.  Both my wife's burger and a friend's were raw, though one was spooked to be medium, the other medium rare.  This was not a busy time or day, so for this poorly cooked food I was quite disappointed."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Giselle C.,"San Diego, CA",6/6/2015,3.0,Ordered the chipotle pork loins. Sauce was good. Spicy and sweet. Well cooked. Asparagus was flame. Wanted to incorporate vegetables. But mac and cheese needs work so it doesn't taste and look like cafeteria mac n cheese.

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lauren B.,"Houston, TX",12/2/2014,2.0,"First things first, as other Yelpers have stated, the hostess at the front needs to perk up.  We were meeting friends who got there before us whom she had JUST seated, when we asked if they were there she basically just waved her hand towards the back and said ""yeah""... We got settled in and ordered drinks.  We did ask some questions about the ingredients in the drinks, which were not answered, so I just had to google.  There needs to be some general training, especially if they are serving specialty drinks.The menu has so much stuff on it, all kinds of sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, etc.. and it's all reasonably priced.  I ordered the chili dog and tots for $6.50.  The tots were amazing.  They were super fresh and crispy and probably the best things I ate all night.  My chili dog was good but the bun should have been toasted or the cheese melted. I kept thinking my food was cold.  The alligator po'boy was spicy and the fries were wilty. My two drinks tasted completely different even though I ordered the same thing.  All the employees we encountered after seating were super friendly and accomodating but not very knowledgeable.  Mehhh.I probably won't come back here anytime soon, I would like to let some time pass and try brunch maybe.... maybe."

I love the concept and the decor is really great. I do think their menu has a few too many choices that aren't the best. Unfortunately I didn't get the right thing, so I'm anxious to go back, but the Carpetbagger burger is not my favorite. I didn't think Cole slaw and fried oysters all belonged on a burger, plus the oysters made the whole burger just taste weird. My wife, on the other hand, had a wonderful veggie omelette which was actually very good. I'll definitely be amending this review upon an updated visit. But for the moment, 3 stars."

I ordered a Chili Mac and Cheese Burger, and my friend had the Alligator Burger. Both sandwiches were nothing memorable. I could have probably made something comparable at home. The prices were reasonable considering you're in market square, but I could have gotten two full meals if I just went to Cook Out. The menu looked really good at first, but like anything else ""don't judge a book by its cover."" However, I do like the idea and theme of the restaurant.Perhaps its a better place to grab drinks. They have a few drink specials that won't break your bank. Other than that, I'd probably skip the food. Service was average - not very personable."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jason B.,"Charleston, SC",1/23/2015,4.0,"Great food, very friendly service, and really kitchy in an upscale, casual, not expensive way. Yeah, this place was pretty awesome. When I first walked into Not Waston's I wasn't sure what to expect on the menu, or the impact that would have on my wallet. It had a modern chic style to it with tables spread throughout the restaurant and a long bar against the wall, but they also had a few big screen TVs which made it feel like a sports bar. There really isn't a single way to describe or categorize this place, and I loved it. The staff was friendly from the moment I sat down. I was there on a business dinner trip, but despite that I'm always sarcastic and tease people. The waiter jumped right in and helped me! He also answered every question I had about the menu items, but there was only one thing I wanted: chicken waffles. Sweet heaven on Earth, I'd never had chicken waffles before but I've wanted these ever since. The meal was cooked perfectly and only took about ten minutes to arrive. It was quiet and cozy inside. Sure, there were a lot of conversations happening all at once, the outer wall of booths are close to each other, but it wasn't overwhelming. It was dark once I got here so the place felt cozy and romantic, so this is a great place to bring a date. Not sure about a first date because once she has those chicken waffles she might run off with the chef. TIP: Had I mentioned the chicken waffles? They are a regional food not found in many restaurants, even in the south, so get these while you can. I don't even like waffles myself, but these were amazing."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Greg G.,"Logan Circle, Washington, DC",9/13/2017,4.0,"I ordered the ribeye, which comes with potatoes and asparagus. The steak is topped with a bleu cheese butter compound and it is quite delicious. My steak was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were very crispy. The meal was fantastic. I sat at the bar and the service was exceptional. The music was great too. I did have to take off one star because the noise level in the space was very loud. I know the venue cannot control loud and rowdy crowds, and it's not unusual to find them in bars, but the ceiling is high and open, which I think (without some type of sound absorption) contributed to the excessively high noise level. My Diet Coke tasted funny too. But noise and soda aside, the meal and the service was more than I could have asked for. I was very satisfied with my experience. Highly recommended."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kelsey S.,"Mount Juliet, TN",9/11/2016,4.0,"Pretty good menu variety.  I've had a couple of their burgers and haven't been disappointed.  The same goes for the dish I ordered on my most recent visit, the Seared Scallop, tomato, and basil pasta.  It was perfect!  The scallops couldn't have been cooked any better and the sauce was flavorful.  They've got a great beer menu.  Got a taste of the Black Horse high gravity cider, and I must say, it took the top spot for favorite cider.  They are quite noisy between the music and the college crowd, so it's not a great place for conversation unless you're on the patio.  Still a favorite for a dinner on market square."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Aly C.,"Las Vegas, NV",9/3/2016,5.0,"My son chose this place because ""I absolutely refuse to eat anywhere that even might be owned by a Watson."" It was mid-festival and everywhere was packed. We waited 45 minutes for a table. It was absolutely worth it. The food is fantastic. The servers were all nice and still took the time to chat with him even though they were all very busy. We've been back probably six or seven times since that first experience. It's always a great experience with amazing food and fantastic staff."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tery M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/2/2016,4.0,"Great food, sat outside and enjoyed the Market Square activity!  My little helper loved her hotdog! Excellent service!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Shay A.,"Mount Juliet, TN",8/28/2016,5.0,"Fried green tomatoes, moscato and ribeye were the best I've seen in Market Square. Staff was attentive and handled our party of 13 with excellence. Highly recommended."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Alexa W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/26/2016,5.0,"One of my go-to places downtown, even though it's hard to choose sometimes because every restaurant is pretty great. Not Watsons has a great menu, lots of choices, and I've not ordered one thing yet I didn't enjoy-- the Chicken and Waffles is my favorite, so good. The decor and ambience is nice too. The noise level is tolerable for a bar."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ashley B.,"Mesa, AZ",8/23/2016,5.0,"We're new here in Knoxville but came from Phoenix the land of amazing local restaurants so we've had a hard time finding places we like as much as back home but this place hit it out of the park! I ordered the chicken and cheddar waffles. I was skeptical of the cheese in my waffles but it was insanely good and came with so much chicken I couldn't even finish it. I'm already so excited to come back and stressing about what I'll order next time. My husband got the cheeseburger and fries and it was sooooo good. The fries were a little soggy so we assumed they'd disappoint but the flavor was insane! I almost ordered a whole other side of them because I wanted to steal them all. The burger was flavorful, great bun and perfect sauces. Plus it's local and grass fed which is always a plus. So happy we found this yummy spot!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sam P.,"Knoxville, TN",8/19/2016,5.0,"I've had almost every burger on the menu at this point, and I've yet to be disappointed by any of them.My favorite has to be the pretty hot burger or the portabello mushroom sandwich.  Both are packed with flavor!I'm happy they offer sweet potato fries as an alternative to normal fries as well.  It's nice to switch it up every once in a while.Service is always great, everyone always seems to be having a great time and enjoying their jobs."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Greg M.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2016,4.0,"50+ restaurants downtown and I'm on a mission to try them all for lunch. Not Watson's is your basic casual place to eat. Burgers, salads, sandwiches. The interior style is rustic. I ate outside under the big awning. I had the Good Morning burger, which is topped with a fried egg. Pretty tasty. Nice bun that held together despite the messy burger innards. The fries are fine too. $9.50 is a fair price. My waitress was nice but forced the fake cheerfulness a bit too much. A little annoying but not awful. (Tell her to relax). I don't know why I'm not more enthusiastic about Not Watson's. There's nothing wrong with it. Food is good. Prices are in line everything else downtown. It just doesn't stand out from the crowd in any way."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Amber A.,"Jacksonville, FL",9/16/2017,5.0,"Ammmazing! Stopped in from out of town and stumbled upon this place based off of some great Yelp! Reviews. They most definitely stood up to all of them. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were so very friendly that I forgot for a moment I was alone. The manager, Erick was exceptional, very attentive and super friendly.  He made one of the best spicy pineapple margaritas I've ever had. I also had the Mahi-Mahi, and being from Florida, I thought it was ahhhhhmazing! Thanks for the amazing southern hospitality, Knoxville and Not Watson's Kitchen..:: I'll be back!"

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ashley J.,"Knoxville, TN",2/7/2016,4.0,"I really like not watsons. We have been several times now; tried several drinks, appetizers, and entrees, and most have been great. The salmon entree with smashed potatoes and asparagus was delicious. I remember the tater tots being pretty dang good. I have gotten the veggie burger but it was so long ago and doesn't stand out in my mind. The fried green tomatoes, sans ham, ruled. The deviled eggs, sans bacon or whatever meaty protein it is they use, were good. However, we tried the shrimp ceviche this past weekend and for $8, neither my husband nor I were too impressed. It was... different? It had like pickled cucumbers in it. Not pickles, just lightly pickled cucumbers. Odd choice. It wasn't bad but we wouldn't order it again. We went specifically to drink and all of our drinks were tasty. I have had the Watson on a previous occasion, and I liked it. But my favorite thus far is the hot buttered bourbon. I really want to go back and try the wedge salad, as it looks delicious. I like the laid back atmosphere of not watsons and we have always had good service."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Stephen J.,"Knoxville, TN",1/19/2019,5.0,"If someone asked to recommend the top 5 burgers in town, Not Watson would be on the list.  The fish and chips are a guilty pleasure.  I save a night a week when I can cheat my normal diet.  They are on the short list."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Shalom S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/30/2016,5.0,"One of our new faves!!!  I do think my Beef Ribs were the best since my mom and fiance got the Rib Eye, which, though very good, paled compared to my Rib dinner's melt in my mouth flavor and tenderness! So at first I was told I could vape at the bar while waiting to meet up with my peeps, but once we got seated I was shut down and found that very disappointing to not be able to add Vape Friendly Award to this review :(However, they also initially informed me at the bar that they had no Decaf, but once we were seated our server said they went to a neighbor restaurant to accommodate our request, which was a delightful surprise!We started off with a Wing appetizer which we requested super mild for my mom's sake, but it was still so hot that I was glad we hadn't been any bolder. Very tasty but almost too hot to enjoy IMHO.Perfect low lighting for our date night and very good service! We'll be back, Arnold ;)"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Robin N.,"Cadiz, KY",5/30/2015,2.0,"We were excited to try Not Watson's, and since Stock and Barrel had a 2-hour wait, we figured tonight was a good time. I wish we'd waited the 2 hours for S & B. The wait for a table wasn't awful, about 35 minutes. We were seated, and it was a good 10 minutes before our server came over. We ordered cocktails and a couple of waters. The cocktails came about 10 minutes later, but it was another 15 before we saw waters and that was after we reminded our server. We ordered burgers--the Parisian and the Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger, both of which came with fries. The wait for food wasn't bad, and we asked for additional mayo when the manager brought it over. No mayo came until we flagged her down several minutes later to ask about it. The food was bland at best. The burgers could have used some salt and pepper, and my dining partner said even the bacon needed something to add flavor. The fries seemed old, like they'd been in the oil far too long, and were soggy, but also burnt-ish.The service we had tonight was subpar. She couldn't have been more inattentive and bored, and while all of her tables appeared to be in front, she remained in the back in the kitchen for long swaths of time rather than checking on her tables.  Our water was never, not even once, refilled, nor were we asked if we might like additional drinks. As I mentioned, the manager was even tardy and negligent. After paying, we left without anyone acknowledging us to say thank you or even looking up from the hostess stand; there were at least 2 people there--a hostess and the manager.We won't be back. The food simply isn't up to the standards set by other eateries in the area, and the service isn't up to anyone's standards."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,F S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/13/2017,5.0,My wife's favorite burger in town ' even over stock and barrel - and all the other plates are good too. Sometimes a long wait but worth it. Good portions and great service.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mary B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/10/2016,5.0,"Friends kid us about eating hamburgers and hot dogs while vacationing. Well, here's the place for the greatest of both! They were so delicious and flavorful. Their menu would also suit those having more variety in mind."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Alexandr S.,"Oak Ridge, TN",5/5/2017,5.0,Great drinks. The mojito was made correctly. Which is rare in Knoxville. The food was also good and reasonably priced.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jay G.,"Fountain Valley, CA",8/3/2016,4.0,Not Watson's has a very nice upscale gastropub feel to it.  Very good beer and cocktail collection.  Attentive service.  I thought my oyster po'boy was excellent and I'm from Louisiana.  Kids all chowed on their kid foods.  Burger salad was unremarkable with the Blue burger.  The Chicken and Waffles was incredible with the bourbon maple syrup.  Would definitely consider it a top dine and drink location on Market Square.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sara S.,"Oliver Springs, TN",6/11/2016,5.0,"Went here last night with some friends before a concert at Scruffy City. The service and food were awesome. I ordered the Good Morning burger, it had bacon, sauteed onions, cheese, and a fried egg on it. It was amazing!! The atmosphere was cool and the hard lemonade was amazing, though small. I would definitely go back and try something else off of their menu."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Matt J.,"Knoxville, TN",1/31/2016,3.0,"Fine, but not impressive. Menu spoke to us, but results weren't up to par. Not bad, just not great either. Atmosphere was good, will give a second try."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Aaron J.,"Knoxville, TN",4/23/2016,3.0,"Decent food, but nothing special.  Much better food and ambience to be had pretty much any where in Market Square.  People rave about their burgers, but what's the point with Stock and Barrel down the way?"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Gwendolyn M.,"Knoxville, TN",4/18/2016,5.0,"We stumbled upon Not Watson's during a trip to downtown Knoxville. It is located in Market Square and is a must to visit. There burgers are absolutely delicious and I am in love with their cheese steak sandwich. They can get crowded very fast as they are always busy. The staff is very nice and we have never had bad service. The fries are fresh cut and are super tasty. My daughter is picky about her fries and she even liked them. They also have a delicious brunch that I have heard amazing things about but haven't tried yet. It is on my to do list this summer. They even have a small patio area outside where you can dine which is great when the weather is nice. The Creole Pasta comes with shrimp,alligator and chicken and it is one of my husband's favorite dishes when eating at Not Watson's. So many great dishes to choose from just means we have to keep going back to try them."

If you are ok with mediocre service then stop by because the food is actually really good. The staff stand around and text and socialize with each other instead of focusing on their customers. We have been here a few times and it's always the same so I can't say they were having a bad night."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,randy s.,"Lexington, NC",10/15/2015,5.0,This place has killer burgers I got the turkey burger my daughter got a chili macoroni and cheese hamburger. It took a little longer to get food fries came out warm but burger was awesome.

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Carly S.,"Knoxville, TN",6/24/2016,5.0,Not Watson's is consistently our downtown go-to dinner spot. The service in is always credible and the food is amazing. I would recommend either the Tuna sandwich or the Not Watsons Cobb salad. The specials are always good too.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kristen M.,"Roanoke, VA",7/15/2016,3.0,"Not Watson's has a catchy name and a design with a fun feel to it. However, when you're greeted by the not so friendly hostess your excitement from the atmosphere will damper a bit. Then you'll be greeted again by a not so friendly waiter and you'll be served only mediocre food. Once you finally get your bill you'll be wishing you picked a different restaurant all together."

Don't count on snagging a place at the bar if you are 21+, kids/minors apparently get to sit at the rail as well....."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Arthur T.,"Cordova, TN",4/29/2016,5.0,"The atmosphere was great. The staff was friendly and best of all, the food was awesome!

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,D S.,"LA, LA",12/19/2016,5.0,"OUTSTANDING! First time in Knoxville visiting the University of Tennessee and my daughter & I came to Market Square for lunch. On a hunch, we chose Not Watson's and what a phenomenal selection it wound up being! Frank & Maurice went above & beyond the call for service & meal selections. We hit home runs with their burgers & the pork medallions were ""to die for""! Sadly they were out of the chocolate cake - however, the Peppermint Brownie knocked our socks off! My daughter says it ruined all other brownies as they will all suffer from comparison moving forward. I love finding new digs for dining & drinks and can say unequivocally, should my daughter select UT as her school, Not Watson's will become a visit staple! Well done, well done indeed."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Justine H.,"Jupiter, FL",7/14/2015,5.0,Service and accommodations to menu and drink preferences were OUTSTANDING!  I believe our servers name was Gus and did not catch the bartenders name but in our group we had some substitution requests for food and drinks and they went over and beyond.  The food was delicious - we had the BBQ sliders and Fried Green tomatoes and all 3 of us had different variations of burgers.  They have an outdoor seating area and a pretty large indoor dining area compared to some of the other spots downtown.  I can't imagine this place getting anything less than 4 stars for any reason. I forgot to snap photos but trust me the food was delicious!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,John B.,"Monroe Township, NJ",6/14/2018,4.0,Ha the tuna sandwich and was tasty and rare. Perfect. Was warned about the fries and they are deadly. Side salad was perfect
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Michael G.,"Maryville, TN",7/28/2015,3.0,"Good, but not great. We ended up here because the wait at Stock and Barrel was too long and because the service at Five was quite literally the WORST I've ever experienced...seriously, don't go to Five. Ever. I wish them quick failure. We waited about 30 minutes after being told it would be about 20. There were empty tables the whole time. People who came after us got seated before us. That system seemed unorganized. Once seated we tried the fried pickles for an appetizer. The breading was really good, but the pickles themselves tasted unlike any pickles I've had before. It was a weird twang. I don't know what a rotten pickle tastes like, but I wondered if I might be eating one...My wife got one of the burgers. It was big, and it was good. Really good. She got tater tots on the side, and they were very good as well. One recommendation: they put something called ""not sauce"" on most if not all of the burgers; ask for it on the side. It's an odd combo of mustard, mayo, ketchup, jalapeno and something else. I wouldn't want it on my burger. I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was absolutely fantastic. The fries were pretty standard fare. The only negative really was the pickles and the service. The place was completely empty by the time we left at 9. There were several servers there, and they seemed to be standing around enjoying each other's company. In the meantime, it took us a LONG time to get our order in, to get drinks refilled and to get the check at the end of the night. I'd eat here again, but I probably wouldn't pick it over the other options around."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Michele F.,"Kissimmee, FL",3/6/2017,5.0,Great chicken and waffles and chill cheese hamburger. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Would definitely eat here again.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Brent T.,"Knoxville, TN",5/30/2016,5.0,This was our first time here and we were definitely not disappointed. The Bleu burger was delicious and the atmosphere is outstanding. We loved the music selection and the food was a hit with our entire party. I would recommend dining here soon.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mike J.,"Libertyville, IL",10/26/2015,4.0,"The family and I saw Not Watson's reviews on Yelp.  The place was packed but we luckily got a booth right away.  My wife and I brought the 3 kids with; an 11 month, 4 yo and a 6 yo because we were traveling and staying in Knoxville for a night.  They were very accommodating for us even when when my 11 month stuck his hand in the bourbon syrup and smeared it everywhere.  The waitress was very sweet when helping us clean up.  Back to the syrup, the wife had the chicken and waffles with the bourbon infused syrup and it was delicious.  A bit spicy for the kids but we loved it.  I had the steak with compound butter and not only was it cooked perfect, but was delicious.  Decent wine list, great beer selection, great service, and great atmosphere.  Next time through Knoxville we will be stopping in again!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Rob B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/31/2016,5.0,"Great place for brunch on the Square. The husband and I thought we would check it out since the menu was so extensive and they had $4 Bloody Mary's. Great atmosphere and they cater to all crowds it seems. Saw families, couples and groups of friends all having a great time. I had the Carpetbagger burger with tots and the husband had the alligator po' boy. The burger was cooked perfectly to medium just like I ordered and the fried oyster and spicy remoulade made it unique. Good enough to repeat. The alligator po' boy had the same spicy remoulade and the husband enjoyed it as much as I did the burger. The Bloody Mary was just okay...nothing special. With a menu so extensive definitely a place to bring friends and family members to try more items."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Heather T.,"Nashville, TN",7/11/2015,5.0,"We went for the first time and actually didn't have to wait! We had the best server, Samuel. He explained all the beer on their menu, and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. I had the ole smokey burger and it was fabulous. The French fries were delicious as well. My fiance had the cheese steak sandwich and if you like the traditional ones, you will love this one! I highly recommend this restaurant and will be back."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Schell G.,"Eureka Springs, AR",7/15/2016,5.0,"Had a late lunch here and it was fantastic. Knowledge staff that helped me pick the right local brew but they have a great spirits list too. It was hard deciding what to order but settled on just a hamburger with cheddar and it was wonderful. Presented well and the ""not sauced"" sauce was delicious! To me, the sign of a good fries are that they don't need any Ketchup and these were perfectly salted and crispy. Would come again for sure!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Sarah F.,"Braceville, IL",4/30/2016,5.0,"We have been here several times now, and each experience has been great. The food is served quickly and is always fresh. I highly recommend their burgers. It can get a bit loud in there, so if it's a romantic evening I would suggest the patio. Their kid's meals are great as well, and they are very accommodating for your family. Great beer selection too!"

Not Watson's definitely didn't disappoint. I had the salmon salad, and my husband had the turkey burger. Both were fantastic. Plus the service was great, and the atmosphere was fun with a touch of funky. We would definitely go back should we ever find ourselves in Knoxville again."

not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kellie C.,"Lenoir City, TN",6/12/2015,5.0,I had delicious burger but enjoyed the beer selection and recommendations from our waiter even more. Excellent service and casual-but-fun ambiance. We will definitely be back to try more!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christi B.,"Laramie, WY",6/19/2016,4.0,Great place on the walking mall. Had a fantastic Kale & Shrimp salad. Would give it more stars but vegetarian options are limited.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jessica M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",11/13/2017,1.0,"Came here last night for dinner and while the food was good, the service was not. Our group all ordered drinks so our waitress put the order in. Three of us got our drinks and the last person in our group (whiskey on the rocks - literally the easiest drink EVER) waited 20 minutes to receive his drink. Once it was brought out, we realized that the glass was dirty and had a hard substance stuck to the glass. It was disgusting. We tell the waitress and my friend orders another drink instead - a beer. So we wait again for that. We receive the beer in a tiny glass the size of a hot sauce bottle and are told that we won't be charged for the whiskey (No duh... why should we be charged?!!). I thought that because they took forever to get us the drink AND gave us a dirty glass, that they'd knock the beer charge off... but they didn't. We all loved our entrees but because of the unsanitary glass and service, I doubt we will be back."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kevin O.,"Milwaukee, WI",10/5/2016,5.0,"Excellent wait staff. She encouraged us to taste a particular beer before ordering it to ensure that we would like it. Ceviche appetizer was light and refreshing. Catfish and creole pasta entrees were very tasty. A tad greasy but we definitely cleaned our plates! Very good atmosphere, both on the outdoor patio and inside the restaurant. We really enjoyed our time here!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Brian G.,"Milford, VA",4/9/2015,4.0,This is my new favorite place to get fish and chips in Knoxville. Skip the house martini though.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Olga N.,"Knoxville, TN",10/29/2015,3.0,"Eaten here twice.  The first time was after they had just opened.  The second was about a year later.  First time was just okay.  The second time the service was more cohesive, and the food was good.  The staff is nice.  The bathroom makes me think they ran out of money while finishing the restaurant-- a bit cheap.  I kinda had a fit over the steak knives as well...seems like they may fall apart in your hand or the blade may snap off and fly across the room.  Charge it to the game 'cos they're a really nice burger alternative to Stock and Barrel if you don't want to wait in line for hours."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,C. John C.,"Knoxville, TN",3/4/2016,5.0,In my opinion they have the best burger in downtown Knoxville. Similar atmosphere to the other Market Square restaurants.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Aly C.,"Las Vegas, NV",9/3/2016,5.0,"My son chose this place because ""I absolutely refuse to eat anywhere that even might be owned by a Watson."" It was mid-festival and everywhere was packed. We waited 45 minutes for a table. It was absolutely worth it. The food is fantastic. The servers were all nice and still took the time to chat with him even though they were all very busy. We've been back probably six or seven times since that first experience. It's always a great experience with amazing food and fantastic staff."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Heather H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/19/2018,5.0,"Absolutely amazing buffalo chicken sandwich their fries r great,and the philly u just can not go wrong!!!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Adam S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/19/2015,5.0,"We stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago while looking for a place to eat in Market Square.  After looking at the menu, we decided to try.  In 2 weeks we have been back 3 times.  We think the Fried Green Tomato appetizer is one of the best appetizers in Knoxville.  We've ordered pan seared scallops, burgers, Buffalo chicken sandwiches, and a Chicago dog.  We have not had bad food or service yet.  Twice we've been served by a guy in a kilt, and he is a great server.  Our only complaint so far is that the food comes out so fast, you don't get enough time to enjoy multiple adult beverages.  We will be regulars even though we live out west."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jessica C.,"Knoxville, TN",3/10/2015,5.0,A friend and I came into Not Watsons for dinner last night with our two toddlers for dinner while I was visiting in Knoxville and we had a great experience! Our server (I believe her name is Lindsay) was very sweet and helpful and our food came out quickly! We each ordered an organic turkey burger and her daughter had kids grilled cheese and my son had the kid burgers... Fries for everyone. Our burgers were amazing! And the kids loved their food too! Both of them gobbled it right up! The fries are perfect! Seriously one of the best quick meals I have had out in a very long time. Plus the staff was just genuinely kind and that is always such a plus when you are dining out with children. I will for sure be going back when we come into Knoxville again!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jeff E.,"West Lafayette, IN",1/8/2015,5.0,"So far I've had a fried oyster po' boy and the market cheeseburger and both were excellent.  The fries are great, but the real treat is that they're one of a very small number of places that offers tater tots.  Seriously, that's so good I just went back and changed from 4 to 5 stars.  Just for having tots.  The beer selection is decent but nothing special, and the decor is serviceable - don't expect anything amazing.  There's great food on the menu, the staff are all wonderfully pleasant, and if you sit in the right place, the person eating with you will hand over her bacon. I won't tell you which seat it is, but you'll know when you sit there.  Free bacon is worth trying it out."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Victoria N.,"Knoxville, TN",8/21/2018,4.0,"My grandson was so excited to tell our server he wanted ""Notcher Mamas Chicken"" he got it all turned around. For $16.00, it was enough for 2 and delicious. But, I do think 12.00 would have been more reasonable. My friend green tomatoes were excellent. The server was prompt and helpful with our outdoor seating."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Andrea S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/23/2018,5.0,"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in a Market Square.   We have had a burger, Philly cheesesteak and brunch.  All were delicious."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Rex L.,"Kodak, TN",12/4/2015,5.0,Visited on Saturday afternoon around 2pm.  Waiter encouraged me to order their French Toast with real Maple syrup.   Excellent recommendation and choice.   Service was great and atmosphere very enjoyable.  Highly recommend anyone to experience the French toast.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lisa B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/21/2018,5.0,Went there last night for GNO it was amazing! I had been wanting to try this place for months! It did not disappoint. I got the salmon mashed potatoes and kale salad it was incredible. I will definitely go again!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Naomi C.,"Denver, CO",4/16/2015,3.0,"I had the device and it was delicious. However, when I returned, I had the Parisian burger and it was not so good. And yes, their hand cut fries are not crisp. I hope to go back and maybe third time's the charm."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Richard O.,"Huntsville, AL",3/24/2018,5.0,Best fish and chips ever! Not over fried or greasy. I had a craving and these met exactly what I imagined. Now I'm fat and content.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lizzy C.,"Knoxville, TN",6/7/2015,4.0,"This place is a solid place to have a casual lunch or dinner with a variety of hotdogs and sandwiches.  Overall, the service and service have been fine.  No complaints."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Steve G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/3/2016,5.0,"As a student, this is easily my favorite restaurant in all of Knoxville because their food is delicious and it doesn't break the bank. They have a terrific selection of both food and drink and I've never had a bad meal here. Why would you spend a ton on a more expensive place when you could go here?"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Erich G.,"Knoxville, TN",11/8/2015,5.0,"We came here after waiting 75 minutes at Stock and Barrel even after calling ahead for a party of 8 (see my complete review on that experience for more info).  After the terrible treatment there we sent a scout out onto Market Square to see what else was available.  They found Not Watson's who said they could take our party immediately.  We quickly left the Stock and Barrel and were immediately greeted and seated - great hospitality and friendly, knowledgable staff.  The service was prompt, all drink and food orders were correct, the food was great and the waiters personality made the whole experience fun.  We will definitely be back!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Julie S.,"Green Hills, Nashville, TN",9/17/2015,2.0,"Sat at the bar tonight - cold food and rude service. After our empty plates say in front of us for 10 minutes-we had to ask for our bill. When she dropped the receipt off, not even a thank you or good night. So disappointing!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Nick W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/31/2016,4.0,"My office is just a few blocks away so I've been to Not Watson's multiple times. All their burgers are great and are priced very well, especially when compared to some of the competing burger places in Market Square.Service can be a bit slow sometimes, but it is does appear to be one of the constantly busier places in the square. Overall I recommend it for a stop if you have time."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mike M.,"Portland, OR",2/21/2015,4.0,"One of the best Philly Steak Sandwich I've had outside of Philly. Authentic with bread and meat from Philly! Onions and peppers were delivered on the side but I'd prefer them fully integrated with the sandwich in the kitchen. The French toast was quite good, however I had to ask three times for butter. Atmosphere has a good vibe but the decor contains no soft materials so the noise level is high."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,James S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/4/2016,3.0,"I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I also wouldn't hestiate to wonder back. Good food, simple, but well made."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jen L.,"Knoxville, TN",9/25/2014,3.0,"Let's just say...I hope since it's new the Owner's are still working out all the kinks. The food menu selection was average if you're wanting upscale bar food. The Deviled Eggs were good, but nothing to write home about. The rest of the food we ordered (turkey & regular burgers) was just average. As far as service goes, our waitress was new, so we gave her the benefit of the doubt. However, when she repeated back our order, yet still messed it up and forgot to bring correct side and drink refills after being reminded twice...I'd rate the service as an epic fail!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Elio G.,"Agoura Hills, CA",10/17/2017,1.0,"The food was good, but overcharging the tip is not right. Even if it is just $0.96. Check your credit card statement after going here."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,David G.,"Nashville, TN",2/11/2015,4.0,"Had their turkey blue cheese burger. Caramelized onions, bacon, gluten free bun. Side was yummy sweet potato fries. Also ordered slaw. $3 per extra side. A little pricey, but fantastically good."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ashley C.,"Miami Beach, FL",4/14/2016,4.0,Amazing food! The service is good as well. It's a small place so be sure to get there early for brunch. The French toast was good but their chili Mac n cheese burger stole the show. The $4 mimosas and Bloody Mary are worth it.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mary Lou M.,"Warren, MI",4/12/2016,1.0,"Where can I get good service?  NOT WATSONS!  My friend and I went there yesterday about 6pm and were seated almost immediately at the first booth. There were 3 waitstaff congregated near the front door,  chatting.  Over the next 15 minutes,  numerous waitstaff walked by us to chat with the hostess and check their phones.  Not one approached our table,  not even to take a drink order.  We decided to leave,  and the hostess looked up from her Internet browsing long enough to apologize."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Miya H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",4/9/2018,5.0,The waiter was very nice. The fish was so well seasoned. I would recommend the strawberry salad too. There was nothing bad about this place. Everyone in there was pretty friendly and happy. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT!!
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Chris H.,"Corryton, TN",10/5/2015,5.0,Everything ive had has been one of a kind and but i think my favorite has been the bacon wrapped deep fried hot dog. Staff is always friendly and they go out of the way to explain what the menu has to offer and what they recomend
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,David C.,"Tacoma, WA",8/13/2015,1.0,"Terrible! Got called for our table that was out door and their hostess let another group walk up and take our table.  So instead they put us at a bar top table with our three year old.  Then our waitress came said hi and left and handed us over to another waiter who must of forgot about us because it took us another 10 minutes to get water.  The place was just too loud to go to for a dinner, too many bro's trying to flex up on each other. Finally after a long time we finally ordered and as we watched people who came after us get their food we asked about ours.  Our food was brought out and my pregnant wife was served raw undercooked cold scallops.  They comped us for the plate but by that point we were already too annoyed and just asked for boxes to go and left."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jon K.,"Dublin, OH",3/31/2016,5.0,Really really good.  Even the kids meals were amazing.  Get the Old Smokey burger!  Chicken fingers were handmade.  I wish I lived around here so I could come back.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Steve P.,"San Francisco, CA",6/16/2018,5.0,"Great food! Our server, Washington, was awesome. He recommended a delicious beer and made sure we had everything we needed. This place is dog friendly and they even brought out fresh water for her before we even asked."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kevin B.,"Birmingham, AL",3/18/2018,5.0,"Amazing food all around! From the chicken and waffles to the fried green tomato's. You will not have an issue with any food you order. Kyle is an amazing bartender. Makes an amazing old fashioned! Great atmosphere, always enjoy having conversations with the staff like I am always welcome and not a stranger."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Luke P.,"Antioch, TN",4/18/2015,5.0,A nice little spot in market square. Not So Old Fashion and fried pickles. Fried pickles are spears but the batter makes up for it. Not So Old Fashion was perfect. I split a chili Mac n cheese and a philly with a friend. Everything was perfect. 10/10 will visit again.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Christa O.,"Knoxville, TN",10/30/2015,5.0,Bacon Bloody Mary!!!! You really don't need anything else. Sliders make a great side if you must have solid food! Prices are high but food and atmosphere are great.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Kaushik G.,"Park Ridge, IL",5/25/2015,4.0,We were driving through Knoxville and stopped here on a whim. What a good decision that was. Our server was very helpful and friendly. Our food was delicious. I had the creole pasta and my wofe had the veggie wrap. The pasta was perfect with good chunks of alligator meat. My wife's wrap was very flavorful which is normally not the case with veg food. All in all I will definitely visit again.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jen R.,"Johnson City, TN",11/2/2014,5.0,"We were happy to find this new spot downtown, it had a really cool ""feel"" to it and the food was delicious!  We stopped in for dinner, they were busy but managed to seat us pretty quickly. Our server came by by & got us situated with drinks really fast. I got the fish & chips and was really happy with how great it turned out, kind of the perfect pub meal. My husband got a burger & it was amazing, they use really good grass-fed beef & you can definitely taste the difference. The burger was cooked perfectly as a medium rare too, sometimes that's hard to find.  All in all, it was a win & we'll be going back for sure. Next time, I think I'll get the chicken & waffles, the table next to us had it and it looked delish!  Stop in, you'll thank me later!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jane W.,"Boynton Beach, FL",9/15/2017,5.0,"My husband and I had an absolutely delicious meal here last night. I had the chicken and waffles, and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger. Not only was the food prepared perfectly, but our server, Marcus, was excellent! He was completely attentive, and he had new soft drinks on the table for us the moment we finished the old ones. We had a wonderful dining experience, and I highly recommend this restaurant. I only wish we lived closer, so we could eat here often."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,E M.,"Kirkland, WA",9/21/2014,4.0,"Excellent menu and speedy service. They have a great selection of creative burgers, brats, sandwiches, and some of the best fish n chips I've had. I also recommend the deviled eggs with ""redneck caviar""."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Margaret M.,"Damascus, MD",10/6/2014,5.0,"Awesome salad and burger, great service. Looking forward to coming back for the chicken and waffles!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Coty F.,"Brevard, NC",7/30/2017,4.0,"Very good! I really enjoyed everything we had, burgers, steak, ahi tuna sandwich, and Brussel sprouts. The beer selection is very good and reasonably priced, unlike some of their Market Square neighbors. Give it a go, you'll be pleased."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mary F.,"Knoxville, TN",11/13/2017,5.0,"Giving a 5 star because we always go here and it is the best food i have ever put into my mouth.. however, the service is slacking and the servers are getting sassy. Not a good look. The portions are also getting smaller and smaller for some reason?"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Janine A.,"Knoxville, TN",12/20/2014,3.0,This place has so much potential! If only they could get the staff on point (we were without a server for a good 20 min at a slow time) and turn off the TVs-  it would have a much better ambiance.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Meridith R.,"Rockwell, NC",7/19/2017,1.0,Rude service from the hostess that sat us to the waiter that waited 10 minutes to get our drink order. We got up and left! Went next door at Cafe Trio for a better experience.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Derrick M.,"Maynardville, TN",1/29/2015,4.0,"My wife and I went to the outdoor market about a month ago and decided to eat lunch. We went in and out of many of the restaurants before we chose Not Watson's. Mainly because there was immediate seating available. The little 2 seater table was very cramped especially since we were placed next to a group of about 10 people who were not very considerate to others around them.  My wife ordered the Parisian burger and I ordered the Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger. Both were great and we loved the French fry holder. Neat place but next time, I think we'll hold out for a bigger table. We'll definitely go back. BTW, our waiter (don't remember his name) was great."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Chris S.,"Frisco, TX",7/3/2017,4.0,Burgers were great.  Service was great.  It was very very loud.  Could not even hear each other at the same table.  Wouldn't go back bc of that.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lacy M.,"Orangeburg, SC",10/21/2014,5.0,Quickly becoming my new favorite downtown eatery. Food is incredibly cooked and presented with care and the prices are unbeatable in One of Knoxville's best areas for entertainment. Great brunch specials and creative delicious burgers! You gotta go.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Charlyne B.,"Tucson, AZ",10/4/2017,4.0,"I loved eating here! I was brought to TN for work and decided to explore on my day off. I asked the clerk at the general store where to eat and they recommended Not's. The Creole pasta was fantastic and the servers were all very nice. The only qualm I had with it is that the town itself is very dog friendly (THAT I LOVE). But the server I had practically went into cardiac arrest if she didn't pet EVERY dog that walked by. Girl, I get it, I love dogs too, but I hope she washed her hands after the encounters. Theres a time for a petting zoo and when your food handling, that isn't it."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Avi T.,"Knoxville, TN",12/30/2015,5.0,"Wonderfully diverse menu-- and the spicy watermelon is the stuff of dreams!!!  This is usually where we end up eating whenever we go to Market Square for dinner.  There is something for everyone here!  My man always gets the same thing-- the Chicken & Waffles-- and it NEVER disappoints! (I know because I ALWAYS have a bite of his!  Haha!)  I don't always eat meat, so I like the fact that they have really delicious vegetarian options on their menu.  The only downside is that the music tends to be a little loud... so it's not a great place for quiet or intimate conversations."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Amanda H.,"Buena Vista, VA",3/27/2017,4.0,"We went restaurant hopping and came across Not-Watson's. Being in the mood for a burger we decided to split one. After much deliberation and some great advice from our waitress, Amanda, we decided to get the Parisian burger. Oh my goodness! That had to have been the best burger I have had in a very long time. The burger itself was nice and thick and very juicy. A ton of flavor! It comes with their house Not Sauce, which has become my new favorite sauce, which I will probably spend countless hours trying to make it at home. They make their own fries that are absolutely delicious.  The service was superb as was the food. I can't wait until I'm back in Knoxville to try something else on the menu. Eric the manager was also really friendly and helpful. I very strongly suggest you check it out!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Mario E.,"Memphis, TN",5/13/2015,5.0,"We decided to try this place out based on recommendations of friends. I tried the Creole pasta that was decent, the pork lion is fabulous, the salmon was my friends favorite choice as well. Good place to try when you are in Knoxville."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Terri L.,"Marietta, GA",2/13/2015,3.0,"Visited here for lunch. It was just okay. Not bad, but not great. My chili was lukewarm, and the salad was kind of bleh. Whatever. I won't return."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Michael H.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",7/28/2015,1.0,OVERRATED food and bland service. All you need to know. They seem to want to be a gourmet burger joint but just don't have the know how to do it proper.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Chris F.,"Columbia, MO",3/26/2017,4.0,Tried to go to another close restaurant and they had a 45 min wait. Not Watson's did not great bourbon and tequila selection. I had a local IPA which was just OK. Good burger. Lots of TVs.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Markley G.,"Santa Ana, CA",10/14/2017,5.0,Exceptional blackened Mahi Mahi and Ceviche with excellent service.  Also served water to our dog without us asking.  Dylan was a great waiter.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,K R.,"Hightstown, NJ",6/4/2017,2.0,"The sweet potato fries were really good, the burger wasn't bad. The service was pretty terrible.  After we were seated it took almost 40 min for someone to come take our order and they were not even busy. Just confused looking servers walking around. I order my burger well done while my friend ordered a different burger medium. After another long wait they messed up the order and made mine medium, I always eat my burgers well done. After notifying our waitress of this, she comes back to let me know that the chef wants to ask if I want a new burger or cook the old burger that was sent back till it's well done, seriously!? They should've had a new order being cooked as soon as it was sent back, I've never been asked that before.  Anyway, the burger was alright once I was able to eat more than an hour after we sat down."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jay E.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2016,2.0,"Average food, terrible service. A friend and I went for lunch and despite the nearly empty dining room, we were seated in the back directly in front of the open kitchen door where we got to listen to three employees' extremely loud discussion. We couldn't talk to each other over the noise, so we asked a host if we could move to a booth closer to the front. We were basically ignored, so we got up and moved on our own. During all this, our server was too engaged in the loud kitchen convo to do more than slam water glasses on our table without introducing himself or acknowledging us. But he came running over to our new table to ask (a bit too sharply) IS THERE A PROBLEM? We explained about the noise, and he was clearly not pleased. HE, the server, was not pleased with US, the customers. Hmmm...A manager came by a few minutes later to smooth things over and offered a free appetizer, but nothing can undo rude, dismissive treatment. I understand that everyone occasionally has bad day, but that should not impact your customers. IS THERE A PROBLEM? Well, yes. There is a major problem, Not Watsons."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Missy W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/2/2017,5.0,"Our favorite downtown restaurant. I've never had a bad meal here. My husband loves the ahi tuna burger. I enjoy the fried green tomatoes and chicken & waffles, which I believe they put a hint of bourbon in their syrup."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jim A.,"Knoxville, TN",4/1/2017,4.0,"Hostess was a little rude, but the food and wait staff made up for it.  Do recommend."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Alicia W.,"Melbourne, FL",2/24/2017,5.0,Superb!!! I cannot explain how great the food and staff were! Sat outside so we didn't have to wait. I'm so glad we came here! Drinks were delicious too! Will definitely be back
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Nancy A.,"Voorhees, NJ",8/6/2016,5.0,"Wow! Out for a day in town and very hungry after enjoying the blue plate music special at the visitors center. Although there were many choices on Market's Square, Not Watson's stood out among them for best burgers in town. Top quality Angus beef, fresh ingredients, and fabulous sides made my lunch exactly what I needed. We started with a true treat of fried oysters. The sauce served with them was a little too spicy for me but came with outstanding home made Cole slaw. Each one of us made yummy noises as we devoured the oysters. My sister had a flat bread special with cured salmon done in house. She finished it to the last bite. Of course we had to have the house Bloody Mary for this Saturday brunch. However, the real find about Not Watson's was the staff. Our hostess was kind and reassuring to find us a comfortable table, the manager stopped by twice to insure that we were well taken care of and our waiter, Irving, was extremely genuine in attention, knowledge and interest in our experience being superior- which, of course, it was!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Louissa L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2017,5.0,"We ate here on Easter Sunday for brunch & the food was delicious, along with the service & atmosphere. We were a party of 5 & wanted to sit outside on the patio & our waiter Blake arranged a table for us no problem. Our waiter Blake went above & beyond to make sure we had a great experience, he was so polite & friendly with us & our kiddos. The food was served with such professionalism & our drinks were never empty. Delicious food, great service, amazing atmosphere, friendly staff... can't go wrong !! Thank you we will be back :)"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Laura L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/12/2017,3.0,"I had some business downtown today and had time to go to Market Square for lunch.I chose Notwatsons because I have not been here before and their fish tacos sounded good.I was greeted with quick seating as it was after 1pm. My server came, did not interact or smile, took my order, did not try to upsell and left. Considering I ordered fish tacos I was a bit surprised it took 25 mins to get them. My server dropped them and LEFT for the duration of my meal. I ran out of my drink, eventually asking another server if i could have a refill. My server showed up again at the end of the meal to collect my money. Not a pleasant experience as could have been. I am a former server and fortunate for him I tip. He didn't deserve it but I tipped anyway. He could have made way better if he just would have acted like I deserved his time. If I go back I will make sure he is not waiting on my table.I hope this is not the norm for service."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Scott W.,"Powell, TN",12/18/2014,3.0,AhI tuna. Sandwich was great.  Staff very helpful.  Need a larger craft beer selection.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lauren B.,"Houston, TX",12/2/2014,2.0,"First things first, as other Yelpers have stated, the hostess at the front needs to perk up.  We were meeting friends who got there before us whom she had JUST seated, when we asked if they were there she basically just waved her hand towards the back and said ""yeah""... We got settled in and ordered drinks.  We did ask some questions about the ingredients in the drinks, which were not answered, so I just had to google.  There needs to be some general training, especially if they are serving specialty drinks.The menu has so much stuff on it, all kinds of sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, etc.. and it's all reasonably priced.  I ordered the chili dog and tots for $6.50.  The tots were amazing.  They were super fresh and crispy and probably the best things I ate all night.  My chili dog was good but the bun should have been toasted or the cheese melted. I kept thinking my food was cold.  The alligator po'boy was spicy and the fries were wilty. My two drinks tasted completely different even though I ordered the same thing.  All the employees we encountered after seating were super friendly and accomodating but not very knowledgeable.  Mehhh.I probably won't come back here anytime soon, I would like to let some time pass and try brunch maybe.... maybe."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jamie C.,"Corbin, KY",11/16/2014,4.0,"Great atmosphere. A little pricey. Me and my husband came in for brunch. I had a bloody Mary.. Which was great! I also ordered the chicken and waffles--pretty amazing. My husband got the ultimate bacon cheese burger with pimento cheese. He said it was awesome!! We had been wanting to come here for a while, glad we did."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Joe S.,"Powell, TN",11/15/2014,3.0,"Updated interior and decent menu, but execution is so-so after three visits.  I work a block away and have been with customers.  The Philly is as good as anything in town.  Chicken and waffles - Bland.  Fries, so-so.  Burger, ok, not amazing.  Most frustrating thing is the need to blast music at lunch when you are trying to have a business lunch.  I understand the staff likes louder music and it seems hip, but I don't see a bunch of kids paying $12-14 + for lunch plus tip so why not make the sound reflect the demographic/price point."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Tara S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/14/2014,2.0,"Over all I did not experience anything that leaves me feeling compelled to return. I will say, I hope that is all due to new restaurant glitches, however they've kind of been open too long for that excuse. First, when we walked in , the hostess, and a waitress who was looking at the books, looked up, met our gaze, and stared at us. Finally the hostess said"" can I help you with something?"". Maybe I sound snarky and old-fashioned but what happened to a friendly greeting from the hostess? Also....we both know what you can help me with. Finding a seat! I am not a census taker, I am hungry! Anyway, we were then seated quickly. I have to compliment the effort put into the remodel - it is soooo much lovelier than the former restaurant which inhabited the space. The bar is lovely, lighting is good.  They had some pretty good wine and beer so we started with drinks. Our server wasn't unable to use the wine tool, so there was a bit of slamming around the table and the cork ended up broken in two with bits in the bottle. Our server was sweet and apologetic, however when we looked over the food menu she checked back every minute or so, which made us feel rushed.The menu seemed enticing in some ways and confusing in others. For example, there were dishes that featured a component which was not available on its own -like an appetizer with bbq pulled pork or something, when pulled pork was not offered elsewhere. This makes me think the pork isn't cooked or smoked in house, because it seems like something awesome to offer if you're making it fresh! We each ordered a burger. They were pretty good, the burger buns were great. We had to wait for long expanses of time to get things that we asked for or were forgotten; the service was very hot and cold. I think I will go again and sit at the bar and maybe have an appetizer to see if things have improved; i hope the best for them but things were just not in sync on my dinner visit."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ricky T.,"New York, NY",11/12/2014,3.0,"All the hype, mediocre food, average service. I ordered a Chili Mac and Cheese Burger, and my friend had the Alligator Burger. Both sandwiches were nothing memorable. I could have probably made something comparable at home. The prices were reasonable considering you're in market square, but I could have gotten two full meals if I just went to Cook Out. The menu looked really good at first, but like anything else ""don't judge a book by its cover."" However, I do like the idea and theme of the restaurant.Perhaps its a better place to grab drinks. They have a few drink specials that won't break your bank. Other than that, I'd probably skip the food. Service was average - not very personable."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jen R.,"Johnson City, TN",11/2/2014,5.0,"We were happy to find this new spot downtown, it had a really cool ""feel"" to it and the food was delicious!  We stopped in for dinner, they were busy but managed to seat us pretty quickly. Our server came by by & got us situated with drinks really fast. I got the fish & chips and was really happy with how great it turned out, kind of the perfect pub meal. My husband got a burger & it was amazing, they use really good grass-fed beef & you can definitely taste the difference. The burger was cooked perfectly as a medium rare too, sometimes that's hard to find.  All in all, it was a win & we'll be going back for sure. Next time, I think I'll get the chicken & waffles, the table next to us had it and it looked delish!  Stop in, you'll thank me later!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Jason G.,"Knoxville, TN",11/1/2014,4.0,We were going to the Library for a drink and decided to have lunch first. This was our first time at Not Watsons but had high hopes after the favorable Yelp reviews. I had the Ahi Tuna burger and my gf had the chili dog. My tuna was slightly over cooked but seasoned well. The chili dog was delicious. Will definitely try the dinner.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Lacy M.,"Orangeburg, SC",10/21/2014,5.0,Quickly becoming my new favorite downtown eatery. Food is incredibly cooked and presented with care and the prices are unbeatable in One of Knoxville's best areas for entertainment. Great brunch specials and creative delicious burgers! You gotta go.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Deborah M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/11/2014,4.0,"Husband and I hit this place up on a rare date night. He ordered the short ribs, which were superb. I couldn't resist the chicken and waffles, which came with watermelon sprinkled with a spice blend. Tasty! The chicken was good, but the cheddar waffles really made the dish special. Portions were kind of insanely large but I don't complain about leftovers. The drink menu is really nice though and that disco lemonade? That situation made my night! Service was kind of meh, nothing special. Good food, great drinks. That floor is insanely slippery which becomes a consideration after a few of those great drinks, as well as the limited bathroom facilities."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,J B.,"Knoxville, TN",9/30/2014,5.0,"I've eaten here three times since they opened, and have to say I loved my experience twice and liked it once.  The fried green tomatoes are the best I've ever had...interesting mix of pimiento cheese, tomato jam and country ham.  Yum!  The Philly was exactly that.  Authentically good...they say the bread is from Philly and the steak is from Philly...and I believe them.  Burger was awesome (just as good as their neighbors if you ask me) and was actually cooked medium!  Had salmon the last time, and it was good, although the sauce wasn't really my thing.  More a personal preference than a bad dish.  I'll be back!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Stacey S.,"Knoxville, TN",9/28/2015,5.0,"My boyfriend and I have been to Not Watsons twice this week.  Both times the food was excellent! We have tried the Parisian burger, the Blue burger, Chili mac burger, and the sweet potato fries. I do believe that they have the best burger in town. They are large, juicy, and full of flavor. For drinks, we ordered the Kingsman ,which is amazing!!! I also asked the bartender to make me a watermelon martini not on the menu and it was great! He used real muddled watermelon with premium vodka! The atmosphere was great,and our server was Amazing! She was so attentive, funny, knew the whole menu, and was really cool to talk to. I was also very impressed with the manager!! He stayed busy delivering food and drinks continuously and trying to greet each guest!!  They have a nice little patio and a nice large bar. The music selection was great and the bathrooms were very clean! We can't wait to go back!"
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Dylan G.,"Nashville-Davidson metropolitan government (balance), TN",5/2/2015,4.0,"Atmosphere was fantastic. We ordered beers and liquor drinks, all the drinks came out great and the server was very knowledgeable about the beers. The food portions that came out were plenty big enough to share one appetizer and one entree. We had the fried pickles which were amasing, whole fried kosher spears with a spicy remoulade was fantastic. We also had the po boy. We ordered the alligator, which came out a bit over cooked and very tough, which left strings in our teeth and very hard to bite through.  Other than that one thing it was a fantastic experience."
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Suzan B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/31/2014,4.0,Food was good.  Service was very good although the waitress had a strong accent and was hard to understand. We had lunch fare- hamburgers and hotdogs. They were good and arrived at our table fast. Sweet potato fries were good. Turkey burger was good too. Good value for the money.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Ingmar B.,"Tempe, AZ",12/27/2014,2.0,The hostess was awful.  I thought perhaps she was just having a bad day but after reading other reviews I'm guessing she's an example of nepotism gone bad? ??  I asked to sit outside and have my table cleaned.  The latter never happened.  Cleaned it myself.  Wait staff seems good second time around and food mediocre. First time here was just prior to Tday. Enjoyed the best burger in years and excellent service and that was during the weekend lunch peak; it's late afternoon presently.  With a sample size of two I'm being stingy with two stars but then again I've been waiting for my bill since a few minutes prior to starting this review and I relish an exceptional burger and consistency.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Scott W.,"Powell, TN",12/18/2014,3.0,AhI tuna. Sandwich was great.  Staff very helpful.  Need a larger craft beer selection.
not-watsons-kitchen-bar-knoxville-2,Katie H.,"Knoxville, TN",2/7/2015,5.0,What a fantastic meal! My fiancé and I had a couple different burgers that we shared and they were fantastic! Very cool atmosphere and very friendly staff!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Melissa O.,"Savannah, GA",6/3/2022,5.0,Great place! I have eaten there twice and loved both meals!!!! First time had Prime Rib and it was great!Second time had Grilled Tenderloin salad and it was great The only improvement would be to get Luxardo cherries for Old Fashion drink.Will definitely go back!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Lynn B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/3/2022,4.0,"My wife and I were just out and about looking for something to eat, and this popped up. I called, and the lady said we're packed, but we'll squeeze you in. I said I would be there in a few minutes. We arrived and were seated promptly. Our waitress showed up a few short minutes later. We ordered the lobster dip for an appetizer. I ordered the filet with shrimp & a baked potato. My wife ordered the Blue Cheese filet. The appetizer was pretty good. My wife really liked it. My steak was cooked correctly. The flavor was good, but it was a little tough. However, it was fine and recommended.  My wife's steak was also cooked correctly and, per her, delicious. Very friendly staff, excellent service highly recommend."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Genevieve B.,"Powell, TN",4/25/2022,5.0,"Literally the best salad I've had in .... Well since last time I ate at Firebirds. The food was delicious, came out so fast, drinks were amazing! We sat at the bar and enjoyed the color coordinated bottles and the signature pineapple soaking in vodka. Yum! You will not be disappointed eating here!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Amy R.,"Sandborn, IN",9/4/2022,4.0,"My family and I decided to indulge ourselves in a nice but casual Saturday night dinner, so Firebirds was calling our name. Overall, the food and atmosphere was wonderful with a variety to choose from. The only mishap was we told our waitress we were ready to order but she must have misheard us and though we said we needed more time to look at the menu. Minor inconvenience that wasn't a big deal but we were ready to order our meals and then had to wait several minutes longer before we could. The restaurant comped us with chips and lobster fondue for the mishap but it was all a misunderstanding. Their willingness to go above and beyond though was very thoughtful. Around the table we enjoyed perfectly cooked steaks, delectable salmon, stripper bass and lobster tails. The red sangria was also wonderful to sip on. If you're looking for some upscale wood fire grilled food, look no further than Firebirds. Would definitely visit again."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Iva C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/23/2022,4.0,"I was very impressed with my visit here! I made reservations on a Friday evening and they seated us right away. I decided to try their signature cocktail, the Double Black Diamond, and it was delicious! For my entrée I ordered the lobster fondue salmon with a loaded baked potato and it was decadent! The rest of the table ordered steak and enjoyed their meals as well. To top it all off we ordered the Big Daddy Chocolate Cake and it was incredible. It was so rich and indulgent that the three of us couldn't even finish it. It was a wonderful evening and I will certainly return again!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Shana L.,"Knoxville, TN",8/21/2022,5.0,Love Firebirds! This was a last minute decision so we sat at the bar and Mike the bartender took care of us! The signature drink Double Black Diamond Martini was smooth and tasty! I ordered the cilantro grilled chicken light and fulfilling. The atmosphere is so nice just an upscale restaurant to enjoy!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jill B.,"Knoxville, TN",2/10/2022,5.0,Still super delicious!  My kids even like the bread and butter.  We always get lobster spinach queso. I like my salmon and get it every time.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jill B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/28/2021,5.0,We have been to Firebirds in Chattanooga on the way down to Atlanta and I was super excited to find out they opened one here in Knoxville because it was great.  We started out with the lobster spinach queso/cheese and chips.  My kids are 5&7 and pretty small so we ordered them a macaroni meal with a side of macaroni and fruit to share.  I'm super glad we did because it's a ton of food!  My kids didn't even eat half of the macaroni after helping with the chips.My husband got the cilantro grilled chicken with the southwest au gratin potatoes and enjoyed that.  I got the wood fired salmon with fresh vegetables and broccoli and it was delicious.  Sadly I didn't have room for dessert so I cannot comment on how the dessert here is.  I know that the one in Chattanooga has delicious dessert from experience so next time I'll have to come hungrier so I can fit it in my tummy somewhere!Some of the servers were training since they just opened 25 days ago but everyone was very nice and our orders were all correct.We'll definitely be back and will bring friends and family.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Caroline S.,"Denver, CO",8/7/2022,3.0,"My fiancé and I went here last night on a date. We have been wanting to try this restaurant since it has opened so we gave it a try. I got the tenderloin salad and he got the aged ribeye with a side of potatoes. My salad was tasty though I feel like they were skimpy on the steak portion on the salad. It came already with dressing on the salad, it was heavily dressed but I like a lot of dressing so that was good! Though, I asked for medium but it came out more well done and same with my fiancé's. Next time if we come we know to ask for medium rare to get want we want. We are not ones to send food back, so we ate it anyways. Over all it was fairly good."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Misty S.,"Maynardville, TN",8/21/2022,5.0,I've been tho this restaurant 3 times and I've ordered something different each time. I've never left hungry. It's always so delicious and cooked well. There service is wonderful so even if I had an issue I know they would fix it. We need a Firebirds in Halls/Powell area PLEASE!!!!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jay M.,"Maryville, TN",11/29/2021,4.0,"Wasn't aware that Knoxville had gotten a Firebirds so decided to stop in based off of past experiences as well as being able to make a reservation to eliminate any wait.We were greated and seated as soon as we walked in even though others were waiting for a table which showed they do a good job honoring their reservations. The wife ordered the steak salad medium while I had the salmon and the little one had the kids mac and cheese. The wife was pleased with her salad as it was a large portion with the steak cooked to medium as asked. The kids mac and cheese is a large portion as well and was served with fruit and fries. The mac and cheese isn't Kraft brand and seems to be truly made fresh. Now for my Salmon; the Salmon was approximately 6 oz portion served with fresh veggies and button mushrooms. The mushrooms were very good but the veggies looked to be a portion of scraps that was left over from other dishes. The veggies were cut up onions, tomatoes, carrots, squash, and zucchini with no taste whatsoever. The Salmon was decent, but not something I would order again. The Salmon came out flat like a tenderized piece of chicken which negatively affected both the taste and flavor.We will be back, but I will try something else."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,John M.,"Maryville, TN",4/11/2022,5.0,"Absolutely wonderful experience during our first, but not last, visit to Firebirds. Our waitress Betsy was a delight. The Double Black Diamond cocktails we began with were great and probably a little too dangerous - how easy they go down. We skipped the apps, soup and salads and went straight for the entrees. I ordered the filet mignon (perfectly cooked to medium rare) with the Southwestern Au Gratin Potatoes (nicely spicy). My wife order the ribeye steak with seasoned steak fries. She enjoyed both (I enjoyed many of her fries). We ended the meal with the carrot cake, though neither of us are dessert people, this is not to be missed. It was incredible. I know we will be back."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Shayne H.,"Knoxville, TN",9/8/2022,5.0,"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary and had a GREAT experience. Our server, Abraham, was excellent! The food was impeccable. Abraham was knowledgeable of the menu, and gave us great recommendations!  Thank you so much. Firebirds is definitely a treasure to Knoxville!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Chelsea R.,"Knoxville, TN",4/15/2022,5.0,"I've been a fan of Firebirds since 2013 and living in Winston Salem, NC. Yes it's a chain, but it's a remarkably well executed one. The food is innovative and delicious albeit a little pricey. Pro tip- happy hour in the fire bar helps, and gives a nice set up for drinks and apps. Highly recommend the tuna tacos and sliders! Didn't indulge on this visit, but the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls are also divine !"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Ceri F.,"Knoxville, TN",10/10/2021,5.0,"It was a fabulous experience. We are all ready talking about going back.  We stopped here for lunch on Saturday to celebrate my husband's birthday early.The staff was fantastic. I opted for The crispy fish taco's. Boy they were delicious. Spicy, crunchy and sweet. They were served on a shell that was both corn and flower. It was a tasty duo. I got tater tots for my side. They were golden brown and delicious!! More importantly they were perfectly seasoned. My husband had The steak salad and it was fantastic! The steak was as tender as you can imagine and beautifully cooked. The steak has a beautiful smoky and slightly sweet note. But the star was the crème brûlée cheesecake! They brought us out 2 little squares as a Happy Birthday (and a signed card) for my man's birthday. The texture of the cheesecake was silky with the slightly crunch of the Brulée.  It's the most delicious dessert I've ever had!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Gary N.,"Knoxville, TN",8/7/2021,5.0,"I've been waiting on them to open for weeks. We loved the Chattanooga Firebirds so kind of knew what to expect but even then, they exceeded all expectations. First off, if you want to have a nice nice out, call for reservation. They had me in a seat within 5 minutes of walking in the door. Beautiful inside and has a showcase type bar with outside area that can be opened up when the weather is nice. Very upscale feel and the service matches that.  I had some excellent tasting ribs but the lobster spinach queso might be the best I have had. Pineapple Martini served shaken, not stirred of course was incredible. Service...midway threw drinking it they bring a new frozen glass to keep the drink chilled. This is more than a dinner, just sit back and take it slow as you enjoy your visit here. Looking forward to another visit soon."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Daryl J.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",9/16/2021,5.0,"FINALLY descent upscale spot on the university side of town.  This is a new restaurant and I enjoyed my whole experience. Very welcoming and intimate setting.Must try 1. Wings 2. Veggie burger 3. Salmon 4. Lemon drop martini Located right across this west town mall , may need to make a reservation as people may migrate after shopping.  CS is great and I look forward to this becoming a routine spot for me and the fiancé !"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Dionne F.,"Knoxville, TN",7/30/2021,5.0,Firebirds Wood Fire Grill has the best overall fine dining experience on this planet. My youngest son and I enjoyed an amazing wood Fired grill steak entree with    delicious sides.The service was above and beyond high quality.Firebirds Wood Fired Grill has the best carrot cake and dessert menu.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Angie H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/14/2021,5.0,"They were on a 4 hour wait, luckily we had reservations. We started with Uptown Apple and a seasonal beer (hubby). For starters we had the lobster and spinach dip- very good. I thought it was better on the complimentary bread but the chips weren't bad. We both had the ribeye, one was aged the other was Cajun. Both were cooked perfectly. Our server (Ashlyn) was so sweet and very attentive. We didn't have room for dessert but the creme brûlée cheesecake looked wonderful. We will definitely be going back to try other items.  There was a blackberry drink that looked tasty. Become a member of their online club and get $10 off your first purchase.

firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Suzy D.,"Chino Hills, CA",4/16/2022,5.0,Everything all was perfectly finishedLoved my salad with strawberries and shrimp The delivered eggs were deliciousCan't wait to go again
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Evan R.,"Palmdale, CA",7/13/2022,5.0,It's a pricey nice restaurant for anybody but very fancy for a date or couples. The menu is pretty pricey but well worth it I actually just got a bacon burger with the bbq sauce on the side. You get to pick how you want you're burger cooked I got mine medium rare because that's how I like it anyways when I tell you this is the most flavorful burger I ever had I'm being honest this flavor of the meat patty was easily top 3 best burgers I ever had. It was about 16$ for the burger but you can get a side of steak fries or fresh fruit. I'm telling you I randomly drove by this place when I was hungry and gave it a try it was totally worth every penny. They also have a massive bar that is color coordinated with a all around good atmosphere.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Mike W.,"Murrieta, CA",5/8/2022,2.0,"Been here several times and it's usually a good experience. However, our Mother's Day Day brunch was not that great. Ordered the steak bowl, which featured a poached egg -the steak was raw in the middle, not close to rare and the egg yolk was over cooked, not runny. That Hail Mary Bloody Mary was absent of alcohol. Service was a bit uninformed.Again, one bad experience weighed against several good, means that we will be back. But, a disappointing experience on a special occasion outing."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Tammy J.,"Alcoa, TN",7/31/2021,5.0,"So happy Firebirds is finally here! I eat at one in PA and loooove their shrimp on a spinach salad. Everything I've ever had there is great and this location is right up there. We were honored to be invited to their preopening weekend. Everything was delicious and the service exceeded even high expectations. Here's the nitty gritty: Salad had just enough dressing, not too little not too much. Lots of strawberries; shrimp was good & did not have tails, which is a plus. Lemonade is very light and not bitter - very, very  good with a bit of a good deed thrown in, because they donate to charity for every glass ordered. Steak was tender, cooked perfect & had great flavor. Lobster queso... oh my. We didn't get it today, but the Ahi tuna is excellent too. And I dont even eat fish! I was calling Firebirds my favorite restaurant here even before it opened, and I'm glad they've held up my claim! Can't wait to come back. Kudos to this team for a top-notch opening weekend that didn't disappoint in any way."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Joseph S.,"Vicksburg, MS",6/9/2022,4.0,"My wife and I stopped in the middle of the afternoon for a late lunch / early dinner. Service was great, place was clean and food choices were very good.  I can't remember what I had for a main course but I do remember it was exceptionally good.   One item we liked the most was a deviled egg appetizer.  We will be back."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Joyce N.,"Knoxville, TN",8/14/2021,5.0,Outstanding! Our 2nd time here and I have had the Baja Shrimp pasta both times! Loved it!Enjoyed the white sangria the first time!!! Yum! Also had the Black Diamond Pineapple martini then as well.So tonight I had the Lemonade Drop martini... well enjoyed 2 of them I should say......while my husband enjoyed his apple martini!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Rodger H.,"KY, KY",6/22/2022,5.0,"Second visit was even better than the the first, which was super. Had salads this time, which were excellent. The service, like before, was great. This restaurant is a hidden gem in Knoxville. I highly recommend it. Also, we were seated in the front dining area which is separate from the main restaurant and the temp was a little chilly. When it was brought to the staff's attention, the manager corrected it immediately. He was everywhere, interacting with patrons, making sure everyone was satisfied. We love it."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Rodger H.,"KY, KY",5/14/2022,5.0,"First time to visit, but we really enjoyed our meal. I had the salmon with fresh veggies, my wife had had sirloin steak with the veggies. We shared the onion ring appetizer. All our food was great, service was outstanding and we were treated professionally. We will be back."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Matt R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/14/2022,3.0,"I really had high hopes for this restaurant as the reviews looked good and I've been recommended this place a few times. To start off I could tell the restaurant was very busy but it took awhile to get someone at the front desk to greet us as they kept walking away and ignoring us. Once we did get a table it took over 30 minutes to have a server to notice we never even got waters. After we got a server things went fairly smooth and quick with drink and food orders. Unfortunately our drinks were very small and mostly ice which was disappointing considering they were fairly expensive. I had high hopes for the food as I ordered one of my favorite dishes and the food I saw online and on plates around me looked delicious. Unfortunately again, the food also came out pretty disappointing. The portions are really small for the price, and the quality did not match that. The vegetables were bland and undercooked, the mashed potatoes were very gluey and thick, and the salmon was over cooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside and very very greasy. I hope to return sometime in the future and try the food again so I can update my review and see if maybe I just had an abnormal experience."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Griffin M.,"TN, TN",6/11/2022,5.0,The food here is absolutely delicious with great service. I ordered the grilled fish tacos and they were perfect. I will definitely be coming back here again.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Marshall F.,"Knoxville, TN",5/19/2022,5.0,"Great service and the steaks were comparable with Ruth Chris, yet the prices are more reasonable. Everything was so good and the drinks are mixed well by very professional bartenders. Nice manager who came around and greeted us.  Can't wait to go back!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Sean B.,"Knoxville, TN",5/8/2022,5.0,First time visiting this restaurant. It was Mother's Day. We were so fortunate to have a server by the name of Jordan. He was so polite and welcoming it was a great pleasure to be one of his customers! The food and cocktails were great to especially with Jordan's recommendations! The salmon is amazing!!!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Bruce S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2022,2.0,"More style than substance.  The place looks great, and the dishes look great too...but the taste is just not that appealing.  My chicken was dry and bland and the steak was nothing special.  The service was great too, but if you actually are interested in top notch food to go with the atmosphere, Copper Cellar Group is better and cheaper."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Kelly F.,"TN, TN",7/31/2021,5.0,"First of all, I think the 1-star review from the guy who didn't realize they weren't open yet should be removed....I understand his frustration but it's not the restaurant's fault that people who got to go to the soft-opening wrote reviews and made it seem open.Now, my review....this is a chain, of course. I'd been to one in Charlotte before and remembered it as an upscale place with good, solid food. The visit here for their 2nd night of soft-opening confirmed my good opinion.We had filet and sea bass. Both done well, although it seemed the sea bass was just a tad overcooked. The sides we had were delicious. Had one mixed drink (that was pleasantly decently priced-- lately restaurants seem to have really jacked up prices, especially when they call a basic drink something special to gussy it up! Wine menu looked ok; beer menu could use a few more on tap (especially darker beers) but overall had a good selection.We also had a seared ahi appetizer (although for me, this dish is becoming too mundane), and a very tasty cheesecake with creme-brulee topping.Last point, the filet was very well priced and very soft, tender and well cooked at medium rare. I'd go back without hesitation, when I want another small filet."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jim W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/1/2021,5.0,"I thought I had written a review Friday night after dinner for the soft opening. Apparently it didn't post.. We had a wonderful dinner experience. The filet was one of the best we have had. 21 day dry aged, cut in-house.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Our server, Stephane was great. She was friendly, courteous and liked helping us.  Mark, the bar manager was helpful and friendly.  The host staff were welcoming.  At least two people opened the doors for us.  A blonde staff member went the extra mile when we weren't sure where things were in the restaurant.  She could have pointed the direction.  No. She walked us to where we needed to go. Great staff, well trained. We are going back Monday night for the grand opening!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Judson H.,"Knoxville, TN",9/4/2021,5.0,"We made it to Firebirds! OK, best ribeye in Knoxville, and I dare say anywhere besides me cooking it. The service was spectacular, and the building is perfect decor and lighting. Background music was on point! Will be going back. Kicked Ruth's Chris as well as Copper Cellar into next Tuesday.Perfect for date night, special occasion, anytime you want a delicious steak, and few drinks and a terrific dinner!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Kristina F.,"Sevierville, TN",7/31/2021,5.0,We had the pleasure of dining here on opening weekend. The front of house staff welcomed us warmly and we were seated promptly. We enjoyed the steak and ribs / both delicious. The kids macaroni and cheese was a very generous portion with fresh fruit.We were always offered warm towels at the end of our meal.Overall a fantastic experience and would definitely return and recommend!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Kevin S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/4/2022,5.0,Trust me when I say this. Get the baked potato! You can thank me later.Hunter is a great server. She took really good care of us. We will return. This was our first time.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Andrea G.,"Knoxville, TN",8/9/2021,5.0,We tried lunch here yesterday.  I had the tenderloin salad and my husband had the salmon on his Caesar salad.   I enjoyed the ambiance.   My only complaint is the $3.25 tea had zero taste.  We will for sure go back.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Tony A.,"Oak Ridge, TN",8/28/2021,5.0,Heard about this place and decided to try it out. Run to this place. I mean Firebirds is fantastic. It's been awhile since everything from the time we were seated till we left was spectacular. Well Firebirds is bringing it. The lobster quesadilla and chips were awesome! I ordered the 12 oz Cajun Ribeye and it was melt in your mouth and so tasty. The vegetables were super. Wife had the blt sandwich with salad and she loved it. Our servers Shay and Hayley were so nice. Carrot cake for dessert and it was great as well. Josh one of the managers came and talked to us and was very nice as well. So go try Firebirds out folks. You won't be disappointed.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Lisa K.,"Jefferson City, TN",3/9/2022,5.0,"Went for a late lunch/ early dinner on a Sunday afternoon, staff was extremely friendly, eager to assist, restaurant was clean, food was delicious, I had filet, tender & cooked to perfection, my husband had ribeye , was also tender, juicy & cooked to perfection, will definitely be back ."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Donald R.,"Knoxville, TN",3/26/2022,5.0,"Another outstanding experience at this Firebird location.  My wife and I met another couple there, and were seated immediately (at 5:00 p.m. on a Saturday).  Our server was very attentive throughout the meal.  We ordered drinks and our meals.  Everyone enjoyed their cocktails.  There was an error when the meals were delivered.  A salmon Caesar salad was a chicken Caesar.  As soon as we pointed out the error, the server apologized and took it back immediately.  A few minutes later, Mark the manager came by to apologize and let us know the salmon Caesar salad was on the way.  He, the manager, personally brought the meal out, apologized again, and removed the charge from their bill.  Mind you, no one ever complained or got upset, we simply pointed it out so the error could be corrected.  As our meal ended, the manager appeared once again with a piece of creme brûlée cheesecake and four forks, on the house, to leave a ""good taste in our mouths"" before we left the restaurant.  And that's how outstanding customer service in the 'service industry' is handled.  We will be back again."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Donald R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/15/2021,5.0,"We have been to Firebirds in Chattanooga several times, and absolutely love it.  On this occasion, my wife and I visited the newly opened location in Knoxville.  It was a busy Sunday lunch, so we sat at the bar, which was nearly empty. We received excellent and attentive service from all the staff behind the bar.  I had a draft beer, and my wife had a glass of red wine.  They offer two size pours, which provides a nice option.  We shared the Wicked Burger with fries (It's basically just a regular cheeseburger with a spicy mayo).  Although it remained busy the entire time we were there, our food came out at a reasonable time and cooked to our liking.  The burger was very tasty, and the kitchen served it split on two plates.  That always scores points for me.  We had a delightful Sunday afternoon in a very pleasant atmosphere.  I don't think you can go wrong at Firebirds.  This location is definitely off to a great start."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jama J.,"Knoxville, TN",6/21/2022,5.0,Service excellent food wonderful! Steaks were so worth it and the house salad was fresh and cold and crisp all good qualities in my opinion. It is pricey but we got the pricey thing and like I said so worth it. We will be back but probably to give something else a try.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Rosa M.,"Alcoa, TN",8/25/2021,5.0,"I have been to many places to eat lived the service, the food, the drinks but best of all the great and excellent customer service. Our server Jade is so sweet and explained everything so professional. Charlene is from Cuba sweet girl and the manager OMG so nice. I recommend this place 100% plus more.  We will definitely go back and sooner than later."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Joshua A.,"Knoxville, TN",2/26/2022,5.0,"Our server Hunter was amazing, the food was delicious, and the service overall was outstanding! Also, the long islands are really strong!!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Mitzi M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/19/2022,3.0,My first visit to this restaurant. Good food not WoW. I expected amazing but.. had dirty martini's which was not very dirty. The stripper bass was delicious and asparagus perfect. I can't eat wheat and could not eat the grain side so had Parmesan potatoes which were good. Guess I'm spoiled my hubby makes better at home. Wine list mediocre.I will go back. We wanted to spend long evening catching up w friends. At 10 pm they turned lights out and people still eating. Website says open till 11 on Friday Not so!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Glen B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/2/2022,5.0,"Our waitress Hunter was excellent, if I could give 10 stars I would. The Philly eggs rolls were the best."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Becky F.,"Duncan, SC",2/13/2022,5.0,Hunter was our waitress and provided fantastic service. Ribs weren't fall off the bone  but tasted great.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Kassi S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/13/2021,5.0,"Probably one of the best meals we have had in a while, the servers were extremely friendly the atmosphere was pleasant and the bar was a real treat to look at."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Elizabeth W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2021,5.0,Wow.... This place is awesome!  Celebrated my birthday there.  The service was fabulous.   The filet mignon was divine.  Cooked perfectly!  I like mine med rare.  My wife had a rib eye and it was awesome too.  We will definitely go back!!!!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Marissa M.,"Oak Ridge, TN",6/16/2022,1.0,Me and my husband have been here once before and had an amazing experience this time was such a disappointment!! We will never be back first of all our favorite waitress obviously has left the company! Our waitress this time was neglectful I ate half my meal drinking the water down leftovers of my soda after asking twice for a refill but never arrived she also! kept touching her nose ring... Also The person passing out food was spitting tobacco! I thought i was crazy until my husband confirmed It honestly disgusted me so much that I didn't eat my meal that was already over priced
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jason T.,"TN, TN",4/1/2022,5.0,Hunter took excellent care of us! Great Place!I love the Philly cheese steak egg rolls!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Sue E.,"Slingerlands, NY",12/20/2021,5.0,Everything was great the server was fantastic the food was delicious and it was nice and quiet where I could hear the conversation of our table we will definitely go back thank you
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Abbey J.,"Dothan, AL",1/27/2022,4.0,Lobster spinach dip is DELICIOUS!!! Steak was also very good. Overall good experience and the manager was very friendly.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Kristen K.,"Springfield, MO",10/25/2021,3.0,"Incredibly overpriced for what it is. My husband and I were driving by and decided to stop and give this a try. I ordered a chicken penne and my husband got a salad. Each entree was almost $20 and honestly I make better pasta at home. It was good but there was nothing making it worth the $$. It lacked seasoning and was fairly bland. My husbands salad was ok too, but nothing to write home about for the price tag. Knoxville has so many restaurants and I was hoping this would be a home run, but there are way better places to go if you want to spend $70 on a dinner (app, entrees, and 2 cocktails)."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Grant D.,"Knoxville, TN",2/14/2022,3.0,"Nice atmosphere, but sadly my steak was way over cooked. Ordered Medium rare and received well done."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Laurie C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/20/2021,3.0,"Celebrated a birthday September 18, 2021 at Knoxville Tennessee location, 4 guests, appetizers egg roll was flavorful, 2 guests had sirloin steaks both were a little tough, side of smashed potatoes were good, side of pecan green beans were good, only get one side with entree. One guest had chicken pasta wasn't very flavorful ( no side). One guest had chicken kebabs, the grilled vegetables could have been cooked a little longer (tough), side French fries were good & chicken was dry. Had lemon cake, chocolate cake and cheesecake all 3 were excellent. Server Lief was excellent server. Reservation at 5:45, sat in booth at the end of kitchen, servers were constantly going back and forth by our table to get to the side tables. Establishment was noisy. 3 guests had water, 1 guest had 2 bottle beers, total was $150 after adding tip $183. May go back at happy hour other than that far better food elsewhere."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Cheryl L.,"Knoxville, TN",8/25/2021,2.0,"Fairly expensive, expected  more finess.  Loud music (sports bar level) not compatible with a dining experience.  Well cooked prime rib overpowered by rosemary seasoning.  Spicy alfredo chicken pasta with only flavor note of chili powder.  Made reservation where it asked if it was a special occasion, our anniversary dinner.  No acknowledgement so why ask?"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Dianna B.,"Knoxville, TN",9/16/2021,3.0,Tried this place for lunch. The server was quite nervous and messed up a couple times but he was nice and attentive. He brought us some bread that had a weird topping on it and the texture was like eating a Brillo pad. Our food came out fairly quickly but my husbands steak sandwich wAs extra crispy well done and it was supposed to be medium. My chicken was good and the broccoli wAs tasty. The price however was kind of crazy for the quality of food and service. $58 before the tip for two teas a steak sandwich and chicken. Probably won't try this place again.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Matthew M.,"Farragut, TN",10/7/2021,2.0,"Well, we decided to wait until the place calmed down from being new  and have all the kinks worked out.  Well, it was hot worth it!  Quality of food was horrible!  Only good thing was the potatoes."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Tammany F.,"Rogersville, TN",12/19/2021,5.0,"First off, Jordan our server was AWESOME. He made our visit terrific and for a Birthday celebration, I have never been to a Restaurant where the severs signed a Birthday Card and gave me a wonderful dessert. The food was just great and the ambiance really good with good music. What I also like seeing was a host come and wipe down the windows which to me is being observant and mindful of the appearance of the establishment. Overall, this place is just the it place to go. Not much it Rogersville so this was a treat."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Thomas B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/17/2021,5.0,"Absolutely phenomenal. If you're tired of the same ole same ole in Knoxville give this place a try. Top notch service, exceptional food, great ambience. Thoroughly impressed! If the Parmesan Red Snapper is on the menu, don't think about it just do it. Lemon cake for dessert."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Nikki B.,"Birmingham, AL",8/1/2021,5.0,"Yay Knoxville has a fantastic new restaurant that isn't downtown! We got to take part in their VIP training night and it was SO good! The staff was so friendly and it was like they've been doing this for months already even though they don't open until tomorrow. My mom got the sea bass and I got prime rib, both were fantastic! The devil eggs... if you like them, you HAVE to try them! The bacon, oh the bacon! *drooling just thinking about those eggs* And the lemon cake with blueberries is perfect for one of those hot days when you want something sweet but not heavy. And you HAVE to try the Double Black Diamond pineapple martini! They marinate pineapple in vodka for a few weeks (we got an explanation about their bar display and how they make it) and they are super dangerous bc you can't taste alcohol at alllll.... Best one I've ever had! So pretty much ya gotta try this place!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jessica N.,"Atlanta, GA",8/13/2021,5.0,"Love Firebirds in other cities, and this location lives up to the standards. Knoxville has been on need of a place like this. Get the lobster spinach queso, prime rib, and creme Brule cheesecake!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Lisa H.,"Walland, TN",7/30/2021,5.0,"We just walked out of Firebirds in Knoxville and we are so impressed! I had a Double Black Diamond and it was pure bliss! The servers were fantastic and ALL of the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. Our steaks came out perfectly cooked and the appetizer was to die for! This is our new ""home away from home for dinner"" establishment."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Chassidy M.,"Cedar Bluff, Knoxville, TN",4/20/2022,2.0,The food isn't that great for the price. Our vegetables still had the grocery sticker on them so I'm assuming it wasn't washed before being cooked. Wait staff was fine and friendly.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Willie T.,"Knoxville, TN",1/21/2022,5.0,"We had a great time with our group of 4.  We made reservations in advance, but at 5:00 there was plenty of seating.  Service was quick and attentive.  The restaurant was spotless, and there was plenty of parking.  Prices, although not inexpensive, were appropriate for this venue.  There was a nice, varied selection of entrees and when ordering beef ""extra rare"", it was served that way.  The food was excellent - portions were just right, cooked perfectly, and well presented.   Salads were large and fresh.  Two of the 4 in our group were celebrating birthdays (58th and 88th), and were given complimentary (unsolicited) desserts.  We will definitely be back again."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Hannah P.,"East Nashville, Nashville, TN",4/16/2022,5.0,"This was the BEST experience my family & I have ever had at a restaurant. The service was superb - I've never encountered a manager as good as Mark, nor a waiter as good as Cody. They both took time to check in with us throughout our meal & made sure that we were satisfied with everything (which we were!!) The food was AMAZING! You must go to this restaurant if you ever visit Knoxville"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Tiffeni R.,"Ontario, CA",8/2/2021,5.0,This place is absolutely amazing from the service to the food. Everything was delicious. The only downside if you want to call it a downside is you only get one side with your entree.....
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Brian R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/30/2021,5.0,Fantastic restaurant new to town.  We always stop by a Firebirds when we are traveling and they are in town. So happy they came to our home town!   It will now be our regular go to!  First night - great food and great service.   They knocked it out of the park.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Stacie H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/31/2021,5.0,We went to the soft opening today and this is going to become my new favorite restaurant.  The American Kobe Beef meatloaf and the Double Diamond martini is absolutely amazing. As soon as you can get a reservation go..it's definitely worth it!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Joan H.,"Knoxville, TN",9/14/2021,5.0,"My son and I came to FireBird's for lunch this past Sunday. Although it was busy we were seated within five minutes. Our server, Jessie(?) had received three tables at once, yet she was efficient and pleasant.  We had a starter (Lobster Queso), which was FABULOUS, my son had a Durango Burger which was also Fabulous, and I had the Fish Sandwich with Soup combo, It was good.  The whole point of going there was because my son saw Creme Brulee Cheesecake on the Dessert menu, so we of course saved room for dessert. CremeBrulee Cheesecake and a Slice of Carrot Cake (which was recommended by our server)  BEST STUFF, EVER. Seriously!  The cake was absolutely divine and the cheesecake was just perfect.  As we were finishing, I noticed that the manager had been engaging with his patrons, one on one, adding a very personal touch to the experience - he stopped by our table. He already knew exactly which desserts we had ordered and wanted to know which one we thought was the best. Hmmm - Close tie. I really couldn't offer an answer, they were both so good.  He then proceeded to tell us he liked the Lemon Cake the best. ""Lemon Cake? You had Lemon Cake?"" I had apparently missed that, so he holds up a ""waiting"" finger and leaves and comes back with the MOST DIVINE, LOVELY  piece of Lemon Cake you will ever have.  Refreshing, light, and airy - this was Heaven!  Overall this was the best experience I have had at a restaurant for a very long time. Servers were efficient and pleasant, food was spot on and the management was engaging with staff and patrons instead of hiding in a back room.  BRAVO!!!."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Michael T.,"Columbia, SC",2/19/2022,5.0,First time here and we will be back. You'll need reservations for a weekend night for sure. And do ask for a table in Hunter's section. She's awesome. Steak was perfect and the cocktails wonderful.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,William T.,"Knoxville, TN",1/29/2022,2.0,"We've been here twice, after the first time we didn't wanna go back, each of us had a meal that was subpar. The first time I had the pineapple chicken skewers. The chicken was dry and not that flavorful. My wife had the filet. She ordered it medium rare. It came out extremely rare, surprisingly tough, and not that flavorful.We just returned for a second time with friends. This time, I tried the fillet, since I was just craving steak. Stupid choice on my part. It tasted the same as last time. Mostly flavorless, just not too tasty.  I've had much better at Longhorns or similar establishments. My wife had a striper bass. We almost sent it back. It was old and fishy. We ended up feeding it to our dogs. We hope they still love us.Our waiter was very attentive, but there was a lady who served our meals by basically saying ""look out"" and just dropping them in front of us.We won't return, and we would definitely not recommend this place to anybody. Save $40 and go to Longhorns if you want a steak. If you want old fish, try Shoney's."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Shawn G.,"Cedar Bluff, Knoxville, TN",8/10/2021,4.0,"Service started a little slow. Took a long time before the drinks arrived. Food did arrive fairly quickly and the filet, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes were delicious. Nice atmosphere with music in the background and several TVs throughout the bar area. Had the cream brûlée cheese cake for dessert which was very good."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jeff B.,"Knoxville, TN",10/9/2021,5.0,Fast service and food was great. I had a 12 oz ribeye and scalloped potatoes and onion rings for the appetizer. The atmosphere was good as well.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,LaBrea D.,"San Francisco, CA",2/14/2022,5.0,We enjoyed a wonderful Valentine's Day lunch there. Food was amazing!!! Special thanks to Hunter who was our waitress. She was excellent. Highly recommend this restaurant and we'll definitely be back.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Kent H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2021,3.0,"Guys night out, reservations at 5:15 for 3. Not crowded at all. We were seated and a drink order was taken. Soft drink was served and beers were served 3 or 4 later. We flagged down a runner for a an order of onion rings... got the o rings and snacked while waiting to place our meal orders. Waited and snacked on the rings. Still no server. Finished the rings, a runner removed the extra dishes and refreshed our drinks and bread (which was excellent). Finally, after an extended wait, our server reappeared and took our meal orders.Another 20 minutes later, our meals appeared. All was quite tasty, Prime Rib, Cajun Serloin, Hambuger. All had excellent flavor and excellent plating. Again we waited, and finally were able to flag down our server for the checks, which we closed out promptly.I was quite impressed with the facility and the food. The servers attention was very much lacking. Not even a  stop to ensure our food was served correctly.  Definitely not the level I expected at a ""higher level"" restaurant. But, we'll be back for the food!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Stu M.,"TN, TN",10/2/2021,5.0,"Fantastic dining experience. We had the most fantastic waitress in Missy. From explaining menu items (including a small sample to see if we liked a particular side), ensuring allergy sensitivities were taken into account, and perfectly attentive - there when we needed her but not hovering. We were also impressed with the manager Josh. Don't know if I've seen a manager more involved with making sure things were right and that customers needs were met. (Seemed like the busiest person in the place, positioning the staff to be successful.) We were celebrating both of our birthdays and they definitely treated us well, including signed birthday cards!The food was fantastic. Ordered a filet, medium and it came perfectly medium. Very few places succeed at that. Wife's dinner (shrimp pasta was also great as was the lobster queso shareable. Overall a great dining experience."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Emily A.,"Anaheim, CA",9/28/2021,5.0,"We have been here three times now. The first two times everything was perfect (food, drinks and service)The third time being this last Friday night, things weren't horrible just not as perfect as usual. Definitely not bad enough to detour us from dining here again. But they were having a bit of trouble with the cook being able to get meat temps correct for some reason. However, service was great as usual. And Mark the manager completely went above and beyond to rectify the situation with our meat. He was very kind! And very serving! Perfect example of excellent customer service. He made sure we left very satisfied customers. Thank you Mark and everyone else at Firebirds for another wonderful dining experience. P.S. Everything we have tried has been delicious but the deviled eggs with candied bacon and the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls are to die for!!! The Sunshine Sting and Black Cherry Collins are delicious cocktails!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Beth H.,"North & East, Richmond, CA",2/26/2022,5.0,Absolutely delicious! So delicious that I forgot to take photos. Will definitely enjoy again and slow down for photos. Had a melt in your mouth Cajun ribeye that was amazing!! It was accompanied with Parmesan mashed potatoes. Split a grilled chopped Cobb salad which is a meal by itself with my best friend. She had the aged ribeye cooked to perfection and no steak sauce needed. She had some semi thick fries that were scrumptious! Carrot cake for dessert made my mouth sing! Big win Firebirds!!
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Vicki W.,"TN, TN",9/18/2021,5.0,"Amazing food and desserts. A must try. Service was free too. The French dip egg rolls, burgers, pasta, drinks and dessert.... You'll love it all!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jordyn B.,"TN, TN",3/11/2022,5.0,"this place is delish! i highly recommend the salmon. great service, too! fancy and quiet place to eat."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Donya G.,"Knoxville, TN",9/6/2021,5.0,"Such a perfect addition to Knoxville's up and coming food scene! It's gorgeous on the inside with a dark vibe, perfect for date night! My girlfriend and I came for happy hour (4-7) and a ton of their drinks were discounted but just as delicious as always! Our server missy was amazing and very attentive, she also gave great drink and food recommendations! The managers Jordan and Josh were very attentive and made sure everything was up to par! Overall I would definitely recommend for a celebration, date night, or even just for apps and drinks! Will definitely be back"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Rebecca S.,"TN, TN",2/14/2022,5.0,"Wow! We had a young server named Hayley and she was amazing! So attentive and overall very sweet. Highly recommend asking for her. As for our food, I got the salmon and Southwest potatoes and it was very good, though the veggies that come with it were a little cold. The lobster queso is also a must try. Will definitely be back soon."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Lacey K.,"Lompoc, CA",8/31/2021,5.0,"We went this past Sunday for my husband's birthday. I was a little nervous because the last few new places we've tried have been disappointing, but this was all around a great experience and I can't wait to go back. The pineapple chicken kebabs were delicious as was my blackberry lemonade ""mocktail."" My husband said his blue cheese filet was awesome (and he's pretty picky). They also surprised us with crime brûlée cheesecake for his birthday, which was amazing. They were kind and patient with my 3 kids (who we would've left at home if we had a babysitter, as this was a nicer restaurant). My 9yo even gave an enthusiastic thumbs up to their salmon. Our waiter was wonderful, the rest of the staff were helpful, and best of all they took reservations so we didn't have to wait outside in 90-degree heat for a table! All-around awesome - thank you Firebirds!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jimmy W.,"Knoxville, TN",7/30/2021,5.0,"We went for our first time tonight. This place is great! The filet is incredible. Dry aged; cut in house and then grilled over a wood fire.  One of the best we have had. The salmon is wood fire grilled as well.  It was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The staff is very friendly, professional but just plain courteous.  Stephanie, our server was wonderful.  I can't say enough positive about her.  The bar manager, Mark was friendly and gracious.  We are going back Monday to try something else.  This is going to be a favorite for date night.  We sat on their enclosed porch. Next time we may try inside. Nice restaurant.  Prices are reasonable with great food and wonderful service."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Megan R.,"Knoxville, TN",9/24/2021,3.0,"I'm not the one who usually gives bad feedback, unless something is wrong. I'm not sure about all the other feedback, if  it was just the fact that this restaurant was new and impressive at first, but our first experience at this location didn't really put stars in our eyes.We will sit down pretty quickly which was nice it took a long time for us to be able to order. Then they ran out of one of our meal choosing, Which they did end up getting more somehow. Three drink orders was incorrect, the food was slightly cold,One of the meals was actually incorrect and was being charged, which they did take that off. The food wasn't that good, but it wasn't bad either. Would definitely recommend Trying it for yourself because even though our experience wasn't as great it could've just been a one off type deal. In about a couple of months we are going to try this restaurant again to see if they have improved."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Ashley H.,"Cumberland Gap, TN",10/9/2021,5.0,"Celebrated our anniversary dinner here. The food was incredible, but our waiter was the best part. Great man who was personable and had a great sense of humor. American Kobe Beef Meatloaf, Devil Eggs, & Wood Fired Salmon were all delicious!!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Kayla H.,"Nashville, TN",11/5/2021,1.0,"Let me start this off by saying I am NOT a picky eater by any means, but this food was just not good. It wasn't just a fluke one bad dish either.. We had a large party everyone got something different. My friend had to send the ribs back they were so tough and bad, my steak was over cooked and just not good, my husbands prime rib was low on flavor and tougher, the crab dip had hardly any taste, even my sides were underwhelming. Pretty much everyone in the party left just feeling like they didn't have a good meal. I haven't had that bad of a meal in awhile. The only thing I liked was the chocolate cake. Nice restaurant, just blah food."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Jenn F.,"Knoxville, TN",10/31/2021,4.0,"Although our meal wasn't bad, it wasn't the best we've had either. our server was kind & helpful. the bread was tasty, the firebirds chicken pasta was good & the serving was HUGE. it just wasn't as flavorful as i had hoped it would be. my husband had the cilantro chicken with the southwestern au gratin potatoes. the potatoes were the best thing we had! knoxville has wonderful restaurants, so i feel the competition is pretty stiff. if i pay $100+ for a meal, i want to leave feeling satisfied. unfortunately, it just missed the mark for us."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Penny M.,"Knoxville, TN",7/30/2021,5.0,"Was invited to pre opening of Firebirds, new to Knoxville. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. Upscale, great place for celebrating a special occasion. Very friendly staff and management. Definitely,  recommend."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Chris H.,"Beech Mountain, NC",8/25/2021,3.0,"We were extremely excited to try Firebirds, but left with mixed reactions. The service was very good, but the food is where the problem was. Half of our table had warm food and half had their plates hot. I'm sure it is because they are still working out the kinks as a new restaurant. The plates that were just warm still had good flavor, but for the price, I will let them work out the problems. Would still say it's worth a visit."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Maddie S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/11/2021,5.0,"My friends and are from out of town, and came here for a later dinner. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed by an amazing host and sat with one of the best servers we have ever had ! The food was delicious and did not take long at all, and the server, Nathan, was very attentive and catered to everything quickly! When the night ended we spoke with two of the managers to compliment their employs and restaurant, and they were very grateful and humble. Will definitely be back soon!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Anita A.,"Powell, TN",8/27/2021,5.0,"We ate at this new restaurant for the first time this past Monday night.  The atmosphere was very calming and relaxing.  Our waitress was Stephani S. and she was great.  She answered our questions about the food, was very attentive and very friendly.  We will definitely ask for her again!  We had pretzel appetizer with dipping sauces and the sirloin steaks.  We will definitely be back to try other food items."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Karen C.,"Knoxville, TN",3/7/2022,3.0,"we were there when 1st open and we were impressed.   today we went to celebrate my birthday and was disappointed.   the ribs had no meat on them and my steak was cold.   the loaded bake potatoes were great, my husband was served a loaded potato when he had ordered a plain potato.  it was  replaced.  the waiter was efficient but the food lack the quality we expected."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Furches L.,"Knoxville, TN",8/10/2021,5.0,We had Missy as our server and she was exceptional!!! She was super attentive and personable. Drinks were never empty! Highly recommend.
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Arthur  M.,"TN, TN",9/17/2021,5.0,"Came for a work lunch, this was my second time coming. Still just as good as the first time. Try the steak sandwich! It's amazing! Brandon G the server was phenomenal, manager Josh came by to make sure our food was good. We will be back again!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Arthur  M.,"TN, TN",7/30/2021,5.0,"Hands down the best restaurant in Knoxville. Service was amazing, the food was perfection! Definitely will be trying everything on the menu!"
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Michael M.,"CONCORD FARR, TN",8/21/2021,5.0,"This place is everything you could ask for. First and foremost, the staff is very cordial and attentive, providing a very inviting atmosphere. The drinks are outstanding with an excellent wine selection. We've tried just about everything on the menu and it has all been very well prepared and delicious. If you're in the mood for something sweet, try the Big Daddy Chocolate Cake. We absolutely LOVE this place. Thanks, Josh K., you have an amazing staff at the Knoxville Firebirds location."
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Mickey H.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",8/8/2021,5.0,I was so pleased with dinner that I went back for lunch. I asked for a medium cooked burger and it came out exactly as expected.  The menu has Pick 2's for lunch at a reasonable price for the quality of the food. Next visit I am going to request a table in the enclosed patio
firebirds-wood-fired-grill-knoxville,Mickey H.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",8/4/2021,5.0,"Everything from the Double Black Diamond cocktails (our table had 6!) to the ending cheesecake and lemon cake was superb!  Striped Bass entree is already tempting me to return. My dinner guest enjoyed the 'melt in your mouth' prime rib prepared to perfection. This is Knoxville's new go to restaurant for lunch, dinner and special events.  Staff was friendly and professional."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Mikayla Y.,"Knoxville, TN",7/30/2022,5.0,"Yum! Cool environment, yummy food, great beer selection! We came here for a late dinner on a Saturday night, and to our surprise it wasn't too busy! They have a wide selection for food and beer. I can't wait to try the brunch, we've heard great reviews for it.My only negative thought was if you will sit on the front patio, the traffic from the road is a little annoying."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,M A.,"Brooklyn, NY",8/28/2022,4.0,"We were just passing through and decided to stop here for a bite to eat. I like the fact that everything is made from scratch and that it used to be an old service station. It was definitely worth the stop. Appetizers-Must have their POTATO CHIP NACHOS! Very fresh! They are house chips made with a cheese blend, black beans, pico de gallo, scallions, and queso dipWe weren't too crazy about the dip it came with. I don't think they needed the dip because everything that came on top of the chips were delicious, fresh and flavorful. It was just right! FRIED GREEN TOMATOES- they were okay. They were on the sweet side and very thin.  Each tomato was topped with pimento cheese, tomato jelly, and sprouts.Entrees BOURBON PORK BELLY- it was very good and a little on the sweet side. It was roasted pork belly, with bourbon and orange glaze, seasoned quinoa, and fresh asparagus.The special - BBQ PORK FLAUTAS- It was delicious! I wish I had room from the appetizers to finish the dish. It's House Chopped Pork, Cheese Blend, Fried Flour Tortilla, House Enchilada Sauce, Crema, Pico De Gallo, Cotija, Cilantro,  and came with Beans and Spanish Rice.We both really enjoyed our choices. If we end up back in Knoxville, we'll definitely return!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,John O.,"Lincoln, RI",8/9/2022,4.0,"Nice job!Loved the choices on the menu Got the Spocy Chicken sliders and the fried green tomato appetizer.Spicy chicke was awesome one of the best slider rolls I've had.Fried green tomatoes were fresh, had an amazing crunch only comment was on the menu it said with pimento cheese! I have never had pimento cheese and it was basically not even there. Less than a TSP on top but overall good job"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michelle H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,"Fantastic as always! Balter never seems to disappoint. The service is outstanding, the food is awesome, and the variety of seating areas makes this place a good meeting spot. Locally (in-house) crafted beer flights for $7, excellent salad, and extremely tasty monthly specials makes this one of my ""go to"" places to impress visitors in Knoxville. I have yet to try something here that disappointed me."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Karmen B.,"Farragut, TN",8/14/2022,4.0,"Stopped in for brunch with some girlfriends. This is the best combo I've found in Knoxville for brunch pricing. $1 mimosas? Yes, please! Carafes are $7.25. Food was good. I tried the breakfast quesadilla that came with potatoes which were amazing. The menu came with a side of fruit, but it was in a dressing dish and maybe has 5 bite size pieces of fruit. Little small if you ask me. Both of my friends got the fried green tomato Benedict and they both ate all of it if that gives you any indication. The vibes were good all around and the patio was nice, too but we are inside as it was first come first serve. They do take reservations, too if you call them."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Colleen R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/29/2022,4.0,"Balter is our favorite family go-to restaurant.  We always start out with the potato chip nachos, and my kids Hoover them down like it's a timed event.Last night we had a big group of family and friends - eleven of us - and Balter was great to take my reservation a couple of days before. Good thing too because it was busy for a Thursday night.Our server Elijah took good care of us, and was great to bring us testers of beer so we could make an informed decision about what to drink.  17 year old and 14 year old had their usual - Balter burgers and fries, I had my usual - Mediterranean salad with salmon, and my husband ventured out this time and tried the chicken lettuce wraps.  He said they tasted much better than they looked - these had a Mexican flair as opposed to Asian.  We were in the dining room, and do yo the crowd it was pretty loud in there, but I don't see that as an issue - just evidence of it being a popular place.I highly recommend hanging out in their outdoor beer garden when you get the chance."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Caleigh J.,"TN, TN",5/25/2022,5.0,"I continue to find myself walking into Balter Beerworks years after finding it for the first time. With exposed distills on one end of the restaurant and my favorite outdoor seating in Knoxville, the atmosphere is casual and cool. It's perfect for bringing the family, having a date night, or meeting up with friends! Balter boasts seasonal brews and their impeccable classics. If it's your visit, don't skip trying multiple with the flight of four 5oz pours. You cannot go wrong with their menu and don't miss out on the appetizers! There is limited parking directly in front of the restaurant, but additional spots are available across the street, above the restaurant, and on the road. Finally, Balter is perfectly located near Old City. You can spend hours right in Balter or wonder down to Pour or explore more of Old City just within walking distance!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Abegail A.,"Rockville, MD",4/25/2022,4.0,"Stopped by for lunch during our day trip to Knoxville. Ordered the fish & chips which were really good. Received two massive cod pieces which were beer battered. They were light, crispy, and had more fish than batter which is always appreciated. The hand-cut fries were also good, but pretty standard. With my meal, I had the brewery mule. It was light and refreshing and came with a good amount of vodka balanced by their house-made ginger syrup.I also tried some of the fried green tomatoes and the Tillamook burger. The fried green tomatoes app was just okay to me. I did enjoy the pimento cheese and tomato jelly it was topped with, though. As for the burger, it was plump, juicy, and cooked to medium-well as asked. I liked how it came with a good amount of cheese that stretched when you bit into it. Enjoyed the bun as well, which came from a local bakery. Also couldn't pass up the banana pudding taster (dessert with banana pudding, vanilla wafers, and whipped cream), which was a good end to the meal. Service was good, with our waiter being friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Parking seemed a little scare in their small lot. Note if you get directions to Balter Beerworks via Yelp, it will likely take you elsewhere."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Rachel G.,"Nashville, TN",4/9/2022,5.0,"In Knox for a client meeting, this was a great choice! Tons of beer and drink options and get your decision maker flowing bc there are lots of yummy options.I went with the hot chicken salad- while it wasn't Nashville HC it was equally delicious. Excellent mix of other items really elevated this salad. We also got a pretzel and chips for the table! Great snacky food."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sarah M.,"Memphis, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,Everything on the menu is fantastic. Whether you go for brunch or at a different time you won't be disappointed. Some of the best fish tacos in town.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Derrick S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/24/2022,2.0,Writing this from the year 2025...still haven't gotten our food...The Toby Keith of restaurants in Knox. Just ain't as good as it once was. Service is terrible. Beer mediocre. Mimosas too. Food is the lone saving Grace if it's ever brought out.But...if you are a white girl looking to get hammered on mimosas for Sunday Brunch. 5 stars easily.Just meh.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sherman K.,"Orlando, FL",9/15/2021,5.0,"This is a great spot to hang out. It is trendy looking and has a nice vibe. There are a few outside dining areas and the inside is spacious. They have some TVs that were showing an NFL game. There is a small parking lot at the building, and more parking on the street and in an overflow lot across the street. The house-brewed beers were pretty good, and they also offer wine and cocktails. The food was fresh and tasty, and the portions are plentiful. The potato chip nachos sounded wonderful, but I was looking for something a little lighter, so went with the Mediterranean salad and I was not disappointed. It was very tasty and fresh as were the other dishes ordered by our group."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tony C.,"Alcoa, TN",8/22/2022,5.0,The atmosphere is great. We sat outside in the breezeway and had a great server. The food was excellent. My wife eats gluten free and they had a great variety for her as well as vegan options. Will definitely go back!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Don C.,"Powell, TN",9/1/2022,3.0,"Good service, friendly staff, so-so food. I had the pork belly, overcooked but not charred crispy skin, just dry, bland meat. Adding some of the sauce it was cooked in barely helped.   My friend had chicken strips and they were just ok as well. Hostess and waitstaff were friendly and helpful."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Deena S.,"Knoxville, TN",6/19/2022,2.0,"Do not order pick up if you want your moneys worth. Very sad, I used to love this place but this is the second time in a row that the food we picked up was terrible. Ordered a Jackson Ave salad and when we got home, I opened up the bowl and all that was inside was a few handfuls of spinach and 2-3 blue cheese crumbles.Missing chicken, cheese, cranberries and pecans.I paid $14 for spinach.We also paid $1.15 extra for sweet potato fries with a burger and had 3 fries in our order."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",1/23/2022,5.0,Great outdoor area and convenient parking. Food was awesome and the portions were very big. I can't wait to go back and try something else. We had a large party so there was a long wait but the outdoor heaters plenty warm so we just got a drink at the bar and went outside to wait. I highly recommend the blackened fish tacos and the potato chip nachos.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tammy M.,"Cary, NC",7/11/2021,4.0,Downtown Knoxville was super busy on this Saturday at lunchtime.  Wait times were through the roof.  We called Balter and they were nice enough to hold a table for our party of 6.They have a brunch menu featured on Sat at lunchtime.  $1 mimosas and $7.50 mimosa pitchers.  That's a great deal !!The food was tasty.  I had the avocado toast.  I was envisioning 2 pieces of toast for the price but I got one piece.  It had an egg on top and some greens.  Served with crispy breakfast potatoes.  Everyone likes their food.  They had a pretty big beer list too.Our server was friendly and helpful.  I certainly wasn't stuffed when we left.  Portions are on the smaller side.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Belinda O.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",7/24/2022,2.0,"I want to start off by saying that I come to Balter very often and have a great time whenever I come with just one other person. BUT, every time I come with a large group (also often),  we always have HORRENDOUS service. It takes almost 10 years to get anything ordered, or to get our check. Our food is always cold. Pretty sure my beans came straight out of the freezer. I always want to show my friends the restaurant but they end up with a disappointing experience. Ope, forgot to mention that we waited 30 minutes just to get water. I love this company so i just wanted to let this be known because it looks like an issue with all of the other bad reviews on big groups. Maybe something needs to change with that.   foods good tho"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tracy V.,"Jackson, MI",8/30/2022,5.0,"We went here for brunch a few months ago, the mimosa carafe was well worth the cost, no bottom shelf liquor used for it. The bartender was friendly, kept everyone entertained, and quick service. Our food was quick, hot and very tasty. Highly recommend this restaurant."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Josh C.,"Powell, TN",7/14/2022,5.0,"I have been coming to this place since they first opened and I absolutely love it every time I come. The Amber beer is one of my favorite beers in Knoxville and I honestly don't know why other breweries in town don't have an Amber???? I am kinda sad they don't have happy hour anymore, I loved coming mid afternoon. However, this is still highly recommended for anyone that loves great food and incredible beer!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Josh C.,"Powell, TN",12/28/2020,5.0,"I love this place!!!! I bring all my out of town friends here. It is my go to spot in Knoxville. They have amazing hamburgers, make sure to try the local grass fed beef! I can't wait until they bring back the happy hour specials!!!!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Connie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",10/24/2021,4.0,"This spot is really a great choice for hanging with friends, eating some burgers, and drinking some beers.Loves:+ Good food, esp for burgers+ Open late to 11pm (Note: most restaurants in Knoxville close at 9pm)+ Beer flight of 4 for $7ish. Def loved Cherry Gose the most!+ Restaurant has its own parking+ Friendly staffI had an awesome time here and would surely recommend it to pals!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michelle R.,"Knoxville, TN",4/30/2021,5.0,"Balter's potato chip nachos were on my post-vaccine bucket list and I just recently got to have them again! They are SO good and like no other nachos I've ever had before. If you're vegetarian like me, there's a decent amount of options here for a beer place, lol. They have some salads, two veg burgers and several apps to choose from, too. The outdoor space is great with multiple options in the front, back and a small covered portion. I will say I'm glad I live within in walking distance and don't have to worry about parking because this place does business on the weekends (esp. during Sun. brunch) and even during the week for lunch and happy hour. Their main parking lot is small, but there are a couple of overflow ones close by. Overall, its a reliable spot if you're looking for above-average bar food classics, beer and a spot to meet up with a group of friends."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lauren P.,"Gore, VA",4/21/2022,5.0,"Absolutely the coolest, friendliest, and yummiest brewery! We sat at the bar and loved the conversation with the bartender, we loved the food, and the chill open air atmosphere pairs perfectly with the beers. Beef sliders came with fresh hot chips. The Hot Chicken Salad was spicy but complimented perfectly with the cool avocado dressing. Sorry, no food pics - it was too delicious!! We will be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Vena H.,"Oakdale, CA",3/29/2022,5.0,Wow what a amazing experience from when we walked in the host was so nice the waitress was so attentive and the brewer we got to meet he just topped off our experience the food was fantastic and the beer we brought some home we will be back
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Timothy B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",4/2/2022,3.0,30 minute wait to sit. 40 minute wait to get food.Food was good. Waitress was nice.Several hostesses and wait staff drank and smoked a weed vape pen at the table behind us :/
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lauren T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3/7/2021,4.0,Great indoor and outdoor seating with lots of heat lamps!The hostess was incredibly rude so our experience started off a little rocky but the food an service made up for it.The portions of the food are huge! We got the potato chip nachos and they were amazing. The pretzel appetizer came with a yummy mustard. The hot chicken sliders were just average though.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Erika M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/27/2021,5.0,"Is it somehow true that I have never written a review for Balter?  How can it be?!  Putting aside all of the nostalgia of being my first date with my husband, Balter is pretty darn fabulous!  Their food is delicious, the outdoor space is prime real estate on a nice weathered day, and their is super consistent!Pre-covid, this was always a favorite brunch spot of mine.  Their breakfast tacos are definitely my favorite in town. You pair that with an all you can eat bar that consists of salads, fruit, cookie and muffins, and snacks and there's not a better deal in town. Especially when you throw in their one-dollar mimosas.  Their menu is great for any time of the day.  I love their grilled chicken salad sandwich and their Jackson Ave salad.  I could eat the entire serving of potato chip nachos and not feel back about it.  And their hot chicken sliders are delicious, offering a smoky and sweet flavor that is completely unique.  Their 3 bears beer (which uses 3 bears coffee) is an easy go-to, but my favorite is their hefeweizen.  During Covid - their curbside pick-up is quick and easy.  I place my order by phone and picked it up in the designated space.  I called when I got there and they brought it out immediately wearing a mask."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Erika M.,"Knoxville, TN",2/28/2016,5.0,"I drive past this place every day on my way to work.  I've watched it evolve and turn into a place that I knew would be right up my alley.  And it turns out, I was right.  This place is rad!  It's absolutely gorgeous in a rusty metal, concrete kind of gorgeous.  If you're just drinking, grab a spot up at the bar.  Any place that offers adjustable stools gets high marks in my book, but that is just the short girl in me talking.  Their beer selection is broad and unique.  If you're looking for something different, try the cask.  Though my personal favorite is the 'bear blend'.  It's fantastic!But don't pigeon hole this place.  It's way more than just beer.  The food is top shelf.  Seriously, I've bounced all over the menu and I have yet to be disappointed.  Where to start?  Three words: Potato Chip Nachos.  It should be known that you may crave them for days.  It's a price that I don't mind paying.  But seriously, close your eyes and point at something on the menu, it's gonna be delicious.  These people care about the food they are making and are doing it right. I've been lucky enough to have several different servers, and I've been pleased to see how well they have all been trained.  Not just in regards to general service, but they all know the menu very well.  That makes all the difference.  I'm beyond eager for the weather to cooperate enough for the beer garden to open up with the fire pit.  For now, the outdoor patio is still pretty great.  Next time you are here, look for me.  There's a good chance that I'll be here too.  (Cue the theme for 'Cheers')"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Taylor A.,"Knoxville, TN",8/27/2021,4.0,"My sister came into town to visit so we decided to try Balter Beerworks. So glad we did! We got there around 6:30 and were seated right away. Our server was super attentive and nice. We ordered around of beers, the splash and hazy IPA, which were both good. I wish the Splash had a little more forward grapefruit flavor. For dinner we ordered the Baja fish tacos, mini sliders and a house salad. My son was also with us so we got him the grilled cheese with fruit. I felt like the food did take a little while to come out but I expect that on a Friday night. My tacos were delicious, however the beans and rice it came with didn't have much flavor. My sisters sliders were yummy and so was the house salad, which was huge. My son had no problems finishing his grilled cheese either. It seems like a fun place to come with friends and as well as a place for families. We will definitely be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tim K.,"Sevierville, TN",2/24/2022,5.0,"I like craft beer and I like good burgers - this place does both well. Add in the good location, the cool vibe, outdoor seating and late menu, this a good go-to for me."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Drew G.,"Lexington, KY",3/27/2021,5.0,"Loved this place!!! It's a college place and I am 50 but We really enjoyed this on our way to Gatlinburg.  We got on the waiting list through Yelp when we were about 45 mins away.  Our turn came up right when we got there.  The food was delicious and the carafe of mimosa's for 7 bucks is awesome!The burger was different than any I've ever had before. It was incredible!  And the flavor and textures of the Blackened Fish Tacos was to die for!   I want to go there again, the next time that I'm in Knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Drew T.,"Knoxville, TN",8/14/2022,5.0,Great location and their food is awesome!  Really good and modern inside with tons of great food options for anyone and even those with a lot of food sensitivities like me
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Dylan S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/19/2020,4.0,"Balter makes one of my favorite local IPAs. Their Firebelly ipa is a great. Not too hoppy but still super flavorful and complimentary of most items on the menu.  The hot chicken salad is amazing. A must order even if your not a big salad person.  Their burgers are really good as are the grilled chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, and the club which is really a hot club served on toasted bread.  The fried green tomatoes and hummus are great app choices.  The fish tacos are just ok, and the soups are a bit hit or miss.  Also, service lately has been good, but a bit spotty in the past."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Macy D.,"TN, TN",6/12/2021,5.0,"We love Balter every time we go. The beer selection is good (I loved the raspberry kolsch, and my boyfriend loved the bear blend), and the food never disappoints. The items on their menu rotate frequently, but I've never had anything I didn't enjoy. The mahi wrap was delicious and so were the sweet potato fries. My boyfriend got the hot chicken sliders and while he said they didn't live up to Nashville hot chicken, they were still good (he said he probably wouldn't get them again). The patio area is also worth noting and is a very pleasant place to sit on a nice day! Inside is nice too, the chairs were comfortable, and the industrial modern vibe is fun and trendy."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,M P.,"Austin, TX",12/3/2021,5.0,"Loved the atmosphere, food was good, service was great, and you have to try a beer flight!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kurt S.,"Cordova, Cordova, TN",7/31/2022,5.0,Great staff. I love the beer selection. Maypop is the fall back but love to try the others. I typically get potato chip nachos and the a great burger.  Last night I saw a salad that looked great.  I then ordered that instead and it was great.  Love this place.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Daniel H.,"Orlando, FL",5/7/2021,5.0,Great brewery in Knoxville we have been to them all and we enjoy their beers and choices in sizes if you want to keep bar hopping etc. (Please drink responsibly) they have a good lunch special and split the salad we ordered which ended up being more than enough.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Scott T.,"Dekalb County, GA",4/17/2022,5.0,"Great place for beers and dinner.  Good atmosphere, good service.  We tasted the stout and the porter- both were excellent!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chase L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2022,5.0,"Come here once a week. Sunday funday's the best but the food's killer 7 days a week. Highly recommend coming here even if you don't like beer! Great variety, staff, indoor/outdoor atmosphere. Thanks for becoming a staple for us Knoxvillians!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Maria P.,"North Massapequa, NY",4/10/2022,5.0,spent lunch here with some friends. the beer is great. I had the appetizer pork belly tacos as my meal and they were very filling
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Alexis L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2/18/2022,5.0,"First off, this is the place to be. They have accommodations for every weather occurrence and temperature. We sat in the breeze way, it was heated and had a seating option for the bar as well. Bria was our server and she was AMAZING. So knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations. She didn't disappoint us once. Very attentive without being overbearing. She anticipated our needs and brought us beer samples of things we may like. 10/10 best service I've had in Knoxville. If you get the chance to sit in her section request her. We will definitely be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Melissa C.,"Crossville, TN",4/1/2022,4.0,Went for an early lunch while traveling through. Ordered the street tacos and an Amber. The beer was great a nice well rounded Amber. The fish taco appetizer was good for the price point. Didn't disappoint for a quick stop.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Amanda M.,"Huntersville, NC",9/25/2021,5.0,"Plenary of parking, even if not directly in restaurant front. We were quickly greeted by Brad our server. He was absolutely amazing and super knowledgeable about food and drinks. We never wanted for anything. Our food!! Chefs kiss! It was amazing. Quite possibly some of the best food we have had. Drinks were wonderful and everything came out in a timely manner. Thanks Brad for your amazing service and food."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Cindy Thuy Tien P.,"Goodlettsville, TN",4/12/2021,2.0,"I was expecting so much from this place from all the great ratings and hearing about it from friends but my experience was far from great. I ate here on a Sunday night so it was bit busy but not the worst, definitely manageable, there was plenty of staff available and working. It took the waitress 20 minutes to come get our orders and when she came she would barely even look at us, asking for our orders as if she was annoyed by us even at our first interaction. She apparently had a table of friends who had came in and spent 90% of her time chatting with them rather than checking on us even though we were next to her friends' table. When our food came out it was disappointing. We got the nachos, hot chicken sliders, salon bowl, and tillamook burger. The nachos were COLD. The cheese on the side was almost solid from sitting so long and the chips had gotten soggy plus there was no where near enough toppings for all the chips. The hot chicken sliders were dry, definitely needed sauce and the bread was stale. The salmon bowl wasn't much of a bowl, it was just a small slice of salmon with a few stalks of asparagus, a small glob of quinoa, and a boiled egg on the side. I ordered the tillamook burger for the interesting avocado sauce but the burger taste no different than a normal bacon cheeseburger not only that but the fries were so far from crispy that they were limp when you picked one up. Safe to say I was already disappointed. We did however try the Maypop beer which was pretty decent. I like the variety of drinks they have to choose from. In the end I still decided to tip the waitress  about  20% and when I told her to keep the change she started counting my money and calculating how much I tipped her right in front of me and made a disgusted face about it. I'd be willing to give the food here another shot but because of the waitress we got, I don't think I will want to come back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bryan S.,"Orlando, FL",3/22/2022,4.0,"One of the best burger places in Knoxville.  We also had the fish tacos, which did not disappoint.  Everything was bursting with flavor.  The atmosphere is great and friendly.  This place is definitely worth a try, you will not regret it.  I can't wait to go back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Natalie M.,"Henrietta, NY",4/9/2021,4.0,"I love this place! The atmosphere is so chill and relaxed. I love to come here on a nice day and sit outside. The staff is super sweet and very helpful if you have all questions. My go-to beer here is the maypop it's light and refreshing especially on a hot day. There happy hour specials are great! But because of Covid the food is no longer Half off, just the beer. If you want food, my personal favorite is the Buffalo chicken sliders. Great level of spice and the blue cheeses compliments the spice quite nicely."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michael H.,"Bradford, TN",3/2/2022,4.0,Solid selection of beer and great food. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Lots of room both inside and out with parking across the street.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ken R.,"Gainesville, GA",2/6/2021,5.0,"Great vibe and cheap mimosas. Only had an ap of guacamole but it was creamy good served with oversized tortilla chips.  A carafe of mimosas was just $7 and they were good, but could have used a tad more orange juice in the recipe.The rest of the menu looked more like upscale bistro foot rather than a college bar."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Nancy C.,"Marietta, GA",3/4/2022,4.0,Fun atmosphere. I had Good neighbor pint. It was nice. The fried chicken sliders were great~ the slaw was especially good.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Melissa S.,"Springfield, VA",3/15/2021,5.0,"This was our one and only lunch stop on our trip to Knoxville and it was marvelous! The wait was an hour, but it was well worth it. I ordered the avocado toast with breakfast potatoes (added pic to my IG story and forgot to save it ). This was my first time having avocado toast and it won't be my last. The poached egg and arugula on top were the perfect pairing for this dish! My husband ordered the breakfast bowl and loved it! The gravy looked so good I had to sneak some bites and I'm glad I did  Even though they were super busy our server was on top of things and friendly."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Celeste G.,"OH, OH",7/4/2022,2.0,"If you want to go to a place where you feel welcomed & they are waiting for you,  this is not the place. Probably not happy to work on July 4th. Manager, Waitresses & hostesses looked like you are interrupting them when we asked for a table . Food was good but when my husband & I got there at 2pm (after the lunch crowd and not crowded) we waited 5 minutes for our waitress, then 10 minutes for our drinks (wine & beer) to come. I had to ask the hostess to get drinks from the bar as I saw the drinks sitting there. Our appetizer came just after the hostess brought our drinks. Waited 20 more minutes for our food. Our waitress seemed pretty apathetic.  Not sure if we'll try again."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Martha S.,"IL, IL",4/19/2022,5.0,"What a great find on a night spent in the Knoxville area. We were seated immediately in a booth which was great as the acoustics were pretty bad for 4 over 60 year olds! Our server, Sam, was wonderful! She made suggestions for drinks and food that were spot on. The fried chicken sliders were so tasty, with a light beer batter crust and just the perfect size for me. My husband got the Brewhouse burger, double patty, with Gouda cheese and a sriracha steak sauce. He loved it and the house cut fries were perfectly fried and crisp. The old fashioned I had was so good and my husband enjoyed 2 beers, the fire belly, and a porter. Both he enjoyed. This is a must go to place if you are in the area! Thank you to Sam for making our evening great!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Courtney W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/19/2022,5.0,We came here for brunch after church on a Sunday ! I called ahead and reserved a table and that worked our great! Make sure you call ahead!! Atmosphere was nice and servers were great too! It's always nice to have great food and great drinks! If you go for brunch make sure you ask for the free muffins while you wait for your food !!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Leslie S.,"Hendersonville, TN",2/5/2022,4.0,Staple brunch spot in Knoxville. My friends and I love to meet here!  Get the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. YUM!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Donald R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/6/2021,4.0,"Our first time here, and (spoiler alert!)...we liked it! In fact, everything was great but the slow service.  And I'm not complaining about it.  They were short-handed (like most), did what they could, and apologized as well. The place is very cool (if I may still use that term). It's an industrial-modern vibe. Their parking lot in front is small, but there's big overflow lot across the street.  The hostess let us select our own seat, which we appreciated.  There's a fairly restricted daft beer selection, but my wife and I still found something we liked.  We enjoyed the ""standard"" burger and fries.  Warning! - It's a messy double patty! It's both family and dog friendly.  We are planning our return trip to try their (very reasonable) Happy Hour."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Amy B.,"Knoxville, TN",1/29/2022,5.0,Food is delicious and the service is friendly and top notch. Very cool atmosphere with a patio. My husband loves the Good Neighbor beer. One of the best spots in Knoxville.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Donald W.,"Knoxville, TN",1/16/2022,4.0,Balter Beer is fantastic.There fish tacos are outstanding as well as the service. We celebrate all our birthdays here every year.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Debra P.,"Knoxville, TN",6/12/2021,5.0,Always have a good experiencehere. Love the fish tacos.Service is usually great and the beer and ciders are cold Nice menu
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Claire H.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",6/15/2022,5.0,"Best grilled chicken sandwich and fries, extremely busy for brunch but worth the wait"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Dave C.,"Southeast, Denver, CO",6/20/2022,5.0,Best brewery food I've experienced... any city and any state. Knoxville is doing local restaurants right.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kevin R.,"Daytona Beach, FL",5/22/2021,5.0,It was my first time and it was simply delicious! The wait was a bit long but when mimosas are a $1 you wait patiently LOL!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Cory B.,"Knoxville, TN",5/3/2021,5.0,"We were here with our Fun With Friends group, and we had a party of about 15 people.  Service was quick and efficient, and was just overall top notch for a large group.  We sat on the patio which is so nice, and the umbrellas with heaters are a great touch. My wife and I shared some pitchers of mimosas which were very good and refreshing.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with potatoes.  The gravy was as amazing as I had hoped when ordered.  Perfect on the thickness and flavors.  Biscuit was really good too cooked perfectly, and it was the right amount of flaky.  My wife got the fried green tomato benedict.  She gave me a bite, and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly too.  I highly recommend Balter for brunch,  and also for lunch and dinner too."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jon W.,"Hickory, NC",10/23/2021,2.0,"Long waits, hot food presented cold. Booths are not comfortable for big people (tall and/or  girth).  Prices a little steep.  On a good note, service staff were doing their best to keep up with the pace.    Parking is limited, so expect a little hike at peak hours .  Not worth a repeat trip."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kellie M.,"Hardin Valley, Knoxville, TN",6/4/2022,5.0,LOVE this place! Bacon chicken mac&cheese is my favorite thing on the menu. It's absolutely delicious!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Zachery P.,"Nashville-Davidson metropolitan government (balance), TN",2/24/2022,4.0,"One of the best places to grab a burger with boys, or with the family, significant other, pick your flavor. The atmosphere is great, the food, tremendous, and beer well it would have been more fitting to name it Balter burger works as that it far outshines the drink menu. While it's nothing to sneeze at I came for the beer as a stayed for the burgers."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ceri F.,"Knoxville, TN",10/18/2019,5.0,"This was our first time here. We were excited to try this place because of the fantastic reviews. We happen to be there a Saturday when they were serving their brunch. We also happen to be there during Oktoberfest. My husband opted for the breakfast burrito. It was enormous! He said it was absolutely amazing. It was served with breakfast potatoes that were both crispy and fluffy. Everything was on point. I ordered off the Oktoberfest menu, the chicken schnitzel served with two kinds of sauerkraut and a fried egg on top. I don't even think I have enough vocabulary to do this justice. The chicken was crispy, moist and tender. They had a mild green sour kraut. The purple had apple cider and cinnamon. Both complement the chicken beautiful. The real winner was the fried egg on top!  It was just the right combo.As far as beer, I had the coffee porter,  if you like bark, complex beer, this is for you!  It was rich and delicious!  My husband had the Kolch,  if you like cloudy Whit beer , this one is for you. Overall everything was amazing and we are looking forward to working our way through the menu!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jason F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",9/25/2020,4.0,"I stopped by here yesterday with my wife for some afternoon drinks.  We were in Knoxville for the day and looking for a second brewery that was open before 3 PM and Balter Beer ended up being our place.  It's sort of a weird shaped building with plenty of both indoor and outdoor seating.  Unfortunately the rain ruined our chance at outdoor seating on this day and so we ended up at a high top table in the bar area.  The restaurant itself was minimally decorated with lots of windows out onto the street.  It had exposed ductwork with large lights that had Edison bulbs in them.  The bar area had two TVS and you could see their pour house, which housed their brewing equipment,  in another close building through the windows.For my drinks on this afternoon, I decided on a flight which I often do whenever I am visiting a new brewery.  At Balter Beerworks, this consists of 4 beers of your choosing and I went with the Maypop (Pale Ale), Gose, Firebelly (IPA) and Bear Blend (Coffee Oatmeal Porter).  I started off with the Maypop which had a little bit of hops at the start followed by some malty sweetness to finish.  Up second was the Gose which was a pretty sour Gose with the perfect kick of salt on the finish  to cut the sour before you could really taste it's dryness.  Third was the Firebelly which the menu described as a classic IPA with pine and citrus.  I did get the pine resin and the hops, just not the citrus.  Still it was a decent IPA.  Last but certainly not least was the Bear blend and you could really smell the coffee on the nose.  Once you got a sip of it, you could tell why as it's very coffee forward from start to finish with a touch of smokiness at the very end.  Out of the bunch I think the Gose was my favorite although I may be a little biased since I do love a good Gose.The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  All of my beers were good and I would be interested in trying some of the food as well."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Patrick C.,"Gainesville, FL",2/15/2022,1.0,"I usually never leave reviews but felt like I needed to. This was our second time at halter beer works and both times the service was awful. The first time we had a larger group but only half of our food was brought out and they forgot to cook the rest. The second time it was just my fiancé and I so I thought oh this time the service should be a lot better. Again service was lacking. There were 4 tables in our sections and we over heard all tables complain about something. 1 table got the completely wrong food, another table had been waiting 45 min and hadn't seen their server. Overall I was really hoping this second time going there we would have a better experience but it was very poor"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michael S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/10/2020,5.0,"This place has it all: great food, great beer, and an AWESOME happy hour!Most recently was there for happy hour on a Wednesday. I got full off of a few chicken sliders (they're so delicious - definitely my favorite thing on the menu), an order of chips and queso (it was like artisan chips and queso), and a firebelly IPA. Perfect happy hour combination.Something to note their happy hour goes from 3-6:30 - and towards the end it can get pretty loud. The place isn't that big - it used to be an old service station - and with a lot of folks crammed into a tight space for happy hour it can get a little noisy. I say this because I once went there for an after work meeting to discuss some  business. By the end of it, we were screaming to hear each other. Great place to hang out with friends - not so great for a work meeting."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,J H.,"Clarksville, TN",5/8/2022,5.0,"Best burger I have EVER had! Everything on the menu is amazing. The burgers are amazingly seasoned, the avocado toast has just the right amount of avocado, and the drinks are amazing. I would recommend everyone to this place no matter what they like. Their service is exceptional and everyone is super nice. The bathrooms are clean and the environment of the restaurant is AMAZING!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Scarlett D.,"Frederick, MD",12/31/2021,5.0,We stopped here on our way home from vacation and it was SO GOOD. Everything tasted super fresh. The salmon miso bowl was amazing and it was the best dressing I have ever had. The sweet potato fries were so crispy and delicious. The mahi wrap was good as well but maybe a little too much cilantro for our liking.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tom H.,"Reston, VA",10/10/2021,5.0,"Fried green tomatoes and miso salmon bowl.  Fresh, perfectly prepared dishes, supported by an attentive staff. Will most definitely be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chris T.,"Denver, CO",9/19/2021,5.0,"This place has a great patio, a great menu, and delicious beers.  The vibe is great and the staff was very friendly.  It's a popular spot, so there can definitely be a wait, but I found the spot to be well worth waiting for."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Andrew A.,"Indianapolis city (balance), IN",10/5/2021,4.0,"Beer is amazing, plenty of options, amazing Ocktoberfest and porter. Food was slow coming out. Appetizers were amazing, especially the potato chip nachos.  Burgers were underwhelming, dry, uninspired toppings. Other food looked good as well, we didn't try anything else. Mac and cheese was amazing, definitely recommended."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,A S.,"San Francisco, CA",1/4/2022,2.0,This place was highly recommended to us so we went for breakfast on a Sunday. Wait was long and when the food got there it was cold. It's a nice place but it fell beneath the expectation. We haven't been back since.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Elaine D.,"Knoxville, TN",8/7/2021,3.0,"While I love the food, the crowds wanting $1 mimosas and the serving staff that never checks back doesn't make me want to go. Pre COVID the staff was very attentive, however now it is each man for themselves. Normal wait time after being seated is 20 minutes for a drink. Be sure and order 2-3 as no one will check back in. Then, after you order at the bar because your server never comes back, you get your food, but it might not be as you ordered it. It was a totally different place a year ago, but the large crowd of stay all day mimosa drinkers and poor service staff keep us from going much anymore."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Taylor U.,"Keller, TX",12/1/2021,5.0,Was driving through from Texas and stopped for breakfast! Had a great experience and even got to bring my dog on the patio!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Emily Z.,"Woodstock, IL",11/27/2021,5.0,"We were in Knoxville for one night and went here for dinner. The service was quick and the food was fabulous! I had the blackened fish tacos and they were awesome! They make them like double decker tacos with a hard shall/soft shell combo which I haven't seen anywhere else. My husband had the burger and said it was very tasty. If we ever go back to Knoxville, we would definitely go back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Pamela D.,"Redlands, CA",7/5/2021,1.0,Hair in my salad. Found this place due to great Yelp reviews and always up for an adventure when on the road. We tried to eat here. Ordered food and picked it up. I opened my salad to start eating it and hair. Before I could even put my fork in the salad. Hair. There was hair on my asparagus. Turned around and took it back to get another one. As soon as my husband brings it in the car I open it up ready to dive in to the delicious looking salad.... And HAIR. Again. So my husband returned it and his Baja tacos too that he did not even have a chance to try but looked and smelled delicious. Staff was nice and apologetic but we just couldn't eat the food. Food looked and smelled great but better watch out for the hair in your food
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jay M.,"Madison, AL",8/6/2021,4.0,"My wife and visited Balter Beerworks and thoroughly enjoyed it. They have a very interesting food menu and the service we received was very good. The food we sampled was very good. Order the potato chip nachos, seriously. Their house brewed beers we tried were nice but certainly not the best available in Knoxville. Theyre well worth a visit and I'm sure we will be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Anna G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2021,5.0,The pretzels on the app menu are HUGE and really good. My family went and had a great time even tho I was a little worried about taking an 8&5 year old. Kids menu delivered! Coloring sheets were really nice! I played a game and ordered hubs a flight of beer 4-4oz little beers and picked the kinds... he had fun with it! He recommends the Maypop!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Mackenzie L.,"Knoxville, TN",11/14/2021,1.0,"Came here with a group of friends, all over the age of 21, with valid id's. After a short wait we were seated outside, the host said they would have someone come light the fire for us since it was 45 degrees F, which they never did. After waiting another 15 mins the server came to get our drink orders  and refused to serve one of us an alcoholic beverage claiming the id was fake and they could ""easily snap it in half."" When we asked him to scan the id to verify it was real, he declined and continued to say it was fake. We then went to the manager and they seemed uninterested and was not empathetic in the slightest bit."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bailey P.,"Laurel, MD",11/10/2021,1.0,"Incredibly disappointed in the service here - I was really excited to have the sliders when I asked for them well done the waitress said incredibly rudely ""we don't do that here"" after the way she spoke to me, I didn't feel like they deserved my business."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jennifer M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/24/2021,3.0,"Food is always amazing. Beer is pretty good. Wish they had a good sour. I ordered a glass of their ""most dry"" white wine & I got what was maybe a 3.5 oz pour of what tasted great, but come to find out ended up costing me $10.50/glass which ended up being at most a $16 bottle of wine (they paid maybe $9) Ridiculously overpriced drinks. Service thankfully made up for some of that, but if you are going to be a brewery, you don't need to charge so much for wine."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Gabrielle Z.,"Charlotte, NC",6/24/2019,4.0,"Really great brunch / lunch spot. Tons of indoor and outdoor space, tasty food, $1 mimosas, and good beer selection.Not only do they carry other people's beers, but also they brew a few items of their own! Brunch item to get: Fried Green Tomato Eggs Benedict, which has pimento cheese AND hollandaise sauce -- total cardiac arrest but the best hangover cure! The breakfast tacos and breakfast bowl are two large items that are really tasty and very satisfying. Also, any purchase from the brunch menu gets you access to the breakfast buffet of pasta salad, fruit, cookies, brownies, and muffins -- which is really nice to graze on while you wait for you food to come out.A lot of people ordered their burger, so that's worth noting! Service was good and friendly. It does get busy!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tiffany E.,"CAMPBELLSVLLE, KY",10/17/2021,5.0,This place never disappoints. Service is excellent and always kind- and the food/ drinks are some of the best in Knoxville.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tiffany E.,"CAMPBELLSVLLE, KY",9/7/2019,5.0,A great brunch experience! I went to Balter on a Sunday morning following an especially awful Tennessee football loss. Even my (very grumpy at that point) husband enjoyed the meal. The brunch bar had delicious muffins- and some other stuff but the muffins were especially great. The fried green tomato eggs Benedict was awesome.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jackie M.,"Atlanta, GA",7/2/2021,5.0,You HAVE to get the blackened fish tacos with a side of fries !!!!  The aioli made the meal. The burrito bowl was def very good as well :)
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jan P.,"Mount Juliet, TN",3/6/2022,5.0,"They make great food, it's fresh & always tastes good. The beer selection is also a wide variety with some great choices."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Leena N.,"Seattle, WA",1/2/2020,5.0,"A friend and I recently visited Balter Beerworks for dinner, and everything was nothing short of phenomenal!Tip: Their Happy Hour specials include beers for $3 - it doesn't get a lot better than that ;-)For dinner we shared an order of the fish and chips and the friend green tomatoes.  The former was beautifully battered and fried to a perfect golden brown, with the fries crispy, delicious, and salted exactly right!  The fried green tomatoes were maybe the best version of that dish I've had anywhere in recent memory :-)The atmosphere is great, the servers are friendly, and the prices are surprisingly reasonable.  Highly recommended!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Matt C.,"Maryville, TN",2/15/2020,5.0,Something about Balter Beer works. They dont even make shakes yet all the boys and girls come to the yard. The beer and premium adult  beverages flow like the salmon of capistrano.The folks bringing the beverages and food  are always all smiles. Just saying balter makes you smile and knowing the meaning will make you laugh.The menu has all the flavors. The burgers stand out but everything is delicious. High recommended a visit if you haven't and if you have I know you're recommend it too.Cheers to Knoxville
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kimberly M.,"Lebanon, OH",12/15/2018,5.0,"We happened upon Balter Beerworks by complete accident. We were traveling home from a road trip and actually stopped in town to eat at a different restaurant that was closing just as we arrived. We spoke to the staff and they suggested we hit this place up and holy cow it was delicious! Plus, their happy hour was no joke. Fish tacos and fried chicken sliders $1.50 each plus hot chicken sliders for $2.00. Are you kidding!? Crazy good food for a crazy good price!! The hit chicken sliders were my favorite with the housemade pickels and blue cheese...YUM! The beer here was on par as well, I tried the double IPA and my boyfriend chose the porter. If I'm in the area again I will absolutely stop by again!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Maddie B.,"TN, TN",9/19/2021,5.0,Best food in Knoxville! I love it so much and think it's so reasonable- and it's dog- friendly which is fun on pretty weather days. My friends and I go every week! I highly recommend!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ana Q.,"Orlando, FL",5/12/2021,1.0,"This is the second time and the last time I order balter to go. I am sooooo dissatisfied. They are extremely inconsistent with their food. The first time, I ordered a chicken salad and it came with half the amount of chicken. This second time I got a balter burger with mac n cheese and the burger was soggy and un seasoned and the mac b cheese was flavorless and dry. What a shame. Horrible experiences."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ana Q.,"Orlando, FL",4/5/2021,5.0,Balter is one of my favorite local spots. The beer is always great and some are seasonal. My all time favorite the winter warmer that comes out around the holidays. I ALWAYS get the hot chicken sliders. They are AMAZING!! But you really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu and I know because I've almost tried everything. Even the salads are so good.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Katie H.,"Washington, DC",12/4/2018,4.0,"A solid place for some good grub. We visited just before 5p on a Friday. We got a table immediately, but it seemed to be one of the last as this place was full! We also saw some people braving the cooler temperatures of November on their back patio. Hubby got the fist tacos and said they were decent. The waitress was awesome enough to ask if he preferred a side other than beans and rice, so he got the sweet potato waffle fries. I think these were the real star on his plate and he and my son ate them all up in no time! I went with the Potato Chip Nachos - chips topped with cheese, crema, black beans, pico, scallion and the queso on the side (you can pour it on yourself or dip each individually). Again, the waitress checked in, asking if I wanted to add bacon. Yes, please!! I found that these chips were loaded with a generous amount of toppings. Obviously the bacon was much appreciated, but I absolutely loved their queso and that I could get plenty in each bite. This place has friendly people, a great vibe (fun and casual) and was clean and welcoming."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Molly C.,"Fort Sanders, Knoxville, TN",3/16/2021,5.0,"Such a great restaurant!!! The potato chip nachos are incredible, I recommend adding avocado onto it! The blackened fish tacos were also incredible! It was super busy but we still had great service, can't wait to go back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Clayton R.,"Knoxville, TN",3/10/2022,5.0,"Besides underage college kids sucking down mimosas.. everything is always really good.. the food is fabulous.. service can be iffy depending upon who you get. Overall though, it's a great place to eat."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,John H.,"Charlotte, NC",11/10/2018,4.0,"Fantastic Experience.We were visiting from out of town and landed on this spot Sat night around 6:00.   Our service and menu recommendations from Ryan were fantastic. He was slammed with a huge table but never seemed to miss a beat with us. The overall restaurant atmosphere was casual and filled with big groups to couples as well as both older & younger folks - including toddlers. Overall a welcoming place for all walks of life.The Firebelly IPA wasn't my favorite - but the Grapefruit IPA was a winner. For starters, we went with Potato Chip Nachos with Ryan suggesting we add chicken and avocado ($14) - what a great idea!   We really enjoyed those and would go back again just for that plate. My bride ordered the Salmon Salad ($15) and said the fish was prepared and cooked well - however the salad seemed to be missing some of the ingredients (e.g. asparagus/peas).  I followed Ryan's recommendation and went with the Blackened Fish Tacos ($14) and they were tasty. I also enjoyed the side of rice and beans.     We loved the place and the food was quite frankly better than we expected for this type of a place (bar/brewery).After being here and experiencing the food first hand, I now understand why the customer appeal is so broad.  Next time we are in town....we'll be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Steven I.,"Chicago, IL",12/17/2020,4.0,Service was great and there is enough room socal distance if you choose to. Ordered a beer after the beer flight and it was great as usual. Our group hace the regular and spicy sliders. They were really good appetizers. There a lot of beer options and you can't go wrong with anything you choose. The sliders were solid as well too.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Steven I.,"Chicago, IL",10/31/2020,3.0,"Came on a Saturday and the place was packed which is usual and we expected it. Waited 45 minutes. Drank at the bar and hung out. Ordered the green tomatoes eggs benedict and they were cold. Almost stale. Nothing to write home about. I was disappointed because my food came out and was almost given to the table next to me. They they then took it back to the kitchen. Not happy about that, they then bring the same plate out to me.Did not say anything but that is a big no no !  However, if you do go during brunch order the chicken and waffles and get them mixed in the nashville hot sauce. My neighbor ordered it and I wish I did. Check them out if you decide to go."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Steven I.,"Chicago, IL",9/12/2020,4.0,I went a couple different times and had a really good experience both times. I have the beer flight which was great. Great selections both times. Service was great too. I only ate the spicy chicken sliders and they were great. My only knock was that there was a long hair in my food. NBD probably from a server. I still ate the food stuff happens. I know it's a big deal to some people but I would return and eat again.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Matt B.,"Asheville, NC",1/15/2022,5.0,"Great atmosphere, great service, good food and good beer.  Many of these smaller restaurant breweries don't have good beer, so I was impressed."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Daisy S.,"Charlotte, NC",10/18/2018,3.0,"I debated my review for this, but I think three stars is more than fair. The positives: the place is very nicely decorated. The chip nachos are delicious. They cut our burger in half and split the servings for us since we were sharing.The negatives: when we showed up it was about an hour before closing - which I know sucks, but we had just gotten into town. There are a few signs saying you have to wait to be seated by the hostess. So we waited. Keep in mind, the place has maybe three tables with people at them. Kept waiting... I went ahead and grabbed a menu myself to see if it would even be worth the wait.Instead she had been hanging out talking to people at a table. Fine, not a huge deal. Waiter takes my order for drinks, brings them... passes us three of four times before coming back to check on us. Makes no eye contact or anything. Reminder: no one is really in here so...We order the potato chip nachos and the tillamook burger. Like I said, nachos were awesome. The burger was ok. Fries were soggy. In this time, I've realized the man the hostess was talking to before sitting us was the manager. And he clearly cared more about the baseball game on tv and talking to his crew than he did about us getting served or taken care of. He walked by us multiple times when we didn't have our glasses full and didn't do anything.Our server did get better for the less than thirty minutes we were there, but everything else (again, other than the nachos) was lackluster. Would not go back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kali F.,"Claxton Community, Asheville, NC",5/13/2021,5.0,SO GOOD! Please get the potato chip nachos (pictured)!! Laura was our bartender and she was super sweet as well as attentive. The food was way better than we imagined! We also ate the salmon bowl and the fried chicken sandwich. Shall be a staple for me here in Knoxville!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Morgan H.,"Memphis, TN",6/6/2021,5.0,their atmosphere is so nice and i love sitting on the patio! The dishes are huge portions and all of us had to get a to go box. the guacamole was really good. I got the bacon grilled cheese for my meal with the fries and that was delicious as well!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Natalie E.,"Knoxville, TN",12/26/2019,5.0,"Great little joint in downtown Knoxville.From their beer to their bar, this place has a fantastic menu to please any appetite. And it's not snobby, all ages are welcome. From their burgers to their salads and street tacos to their fish and chips, everything we have tried is delicious. And save room for dessert, the skillet cookie and brownies are delicious! It's clean and bright inside. Comfortable booths and tables. It's the kind of place where you show up and run into people you know too! Words out though, you will probably have a little bit of a wait, so plan ahead!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lisa M.,"Lafayette, LA",11/1/2020,4.0,My husband and I ate dinner here after a long hike. We ordered burgers and fries. Gluten free bun options available. Fries do not have extra batter but are fried in a shared fryer
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jim H.,"Chattanooga, TN",9/19/2019,5.0,"Yes yes and more yesses. So many great things to share. Had a variety of apps on happy hour special to start. The chips & queso totally on point. Hummus as well. My friend got a fish taco & wished he ordered 10 of them & just had that for dinner. Had the Tillamook burger for dinner. It was big, juicy, messy and delicious. Definitely lived up to the hype as an expert Balterian suggested it. The beer was perfect. Good Neighbor Kolsch on a hot night. Summer in a glass. Lots of excellent beer choices & food in abundance. Star of the show? Our server Kendall. Knowledgeable, helpful, attentive without being over-bearing. Got the 5th star."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Alec B.,"Knoxville, TN",1/16/2022,5.0,"The food and beer were great. Cory Brice is the best, he works there, and he came out and made me feel welcome! I had a great time at Balter's; there is a fun atmosphere and good food that the staff provide"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Flo V.,"Punta Gorda, FL",9/14/2019,5.0,"Awesome is not a big enough word for this place.   We're traveling and decided to seek out a Brewery with food with our grown kids.  We found Balter Beerworks with the help of YELP.We got there just as they were opening.   Friendly staff and we ordered our beers as we looked at the menu.  Lot of choices.We ordered hamburgers and were not disappointed.... not at all.  Obviously, we had to order more beers   The lunch crowd started filling the place.  What a wonderful find!!  We loved it and would definitely go back when in the area."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Elizabeth T.,"Harrisburg, PA",3/14/2020,5.0,"Great Happy hour and great beerMy boyfriend got the Amberiffic and was very pleased. I'm not a beer person so I got the gypsy circus cider. The cider was really good, I ended up going and buying a 4 pack afterwards before heading home. We also got some food and it was heavenly. We had fish tacos and chicken sliders and the pimento and hummus plate. All were great!! And our server was the absolute best!!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Mike K.,"Sunbury, OH",11/30/2019,5.0,I really enjoyed this place even though I am not a craft beer guy. The service was spot on and the waiter rocked. I had the chicken picatia which I thought was awesome. The environment is really cool with a casual vibe.  I have been on a quest to try all the down town Knoxville restaurants and this one is worth a visit.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Savvy H.,"Concord Audobon, Chattanooga, TN",1/3/2022,5.0,"One of my favorite spots in Knox, always take friends here if its their first time visiting the city! Lots of beer on tap, great service, and fresh burgers :)"

Enjoy my trip here every time, and I'm just there for the food!- Love the inside look of the place, really pops during the day time. - One of my fave places to go to nearby because they have their own private lot to park at- Clean at the table and in the restroomsFave Dishes:- Caramelized Brussel sprouts- Fried Green Tomatoes- Balter Burger (with the upgrade to the local mitchell farms patty!)- Tillamook Burger (patty upgrade!)- Shrimp & GritsIf you have been planning on getting here, then get there...chances are I'll see you there!"

Fresh products fused into perfection!!!  ...and waffle and chicken far exceeded expectations! The Hoppy Holler beer was well balanced and the Good Neighbor was also perfect! Next time we are in Knoxville- this will be our first stop!!!  Thanks for a great brunch!!!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bailey T.,"Maryville, TN",12/28/2020,4.0,Food was delicious! Did have some trouble getting our app out in a timely manner (took over 30 min and it was an empty restaurant) they took it off our ticket. Would definitely get the potato chip nachos again! Add chicken if you get them!

I've been eating here for about a year now and I have never been dissatisfied! The best server they have is Alec! He makes you feel welcomed from the moment he opens his mouth. I enjoy showing new friends and family this restaurant and I don't plan on stopping!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bethany N.,"Powell, TN",11/22/2020,5.0,Great place super close to downtown but with good parking. This is my favorite lunch spot and the beers are always great.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kathryn C.,"Knoxville, TN",11/20/2020,5.0,I had lunch with a friend here today. Food and service excellent. I had the Fish & Chips and ate every bite. She has the beer cheese soup and a sandwich.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Dylan S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/19/2020,4.0,"Balter makes one of my favorite local IPAs. Their Firebelly ipa is a great. Not too hoppy but still super flavorful and complimentary of most items on the menu.  The hot chicken salad is amazing. A must order even if your not a big salad person.  Their burgers are really good as are the grilled chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, and the club which is really a hot club served on toasted bread.  The fried green tomatoes and hummus are great app choices.  The fish tacos are just ok, and the soups are a bit hit or miss.  Also, service lately has been good, but a bit spotty in the past."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ilyssa R.,"Kissimmee, FL",11/17/2020,5.0,"Probably my favorite brewery that I've visited in Knoxville so far.

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Andrew C.,"Fort Sanders, Knoxville, TN",11/15/2020,5.0,"The food was above par. The depth of flavor of the sliders as well as the avocado toast was unique. The setting was enjoyable and the history of the establishment is one of a kind. Jacqueline was incredibly attentive and very personable. As a GM in the hospitality industry, I was thoroughly impressed with how she managed tables while also providing great customer service. I wish we could have more altruistic servers like her in our sector. I would highly recommend anyone to dine here."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kate G.,"Knoxville, TN",11/3/2020,5.0,Cutest outdoor seating. Incredible food with incredible beer that they make in house. The brunch looks so good and I will be back!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Emily B.,"Lexington, KY",4/9/2019,4.0,"Probably the best Happy Hour I've ever been to, so definitely come for that.  The beers were consistently good (and really well-priced at Happy Hour), the service was excellent, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the food was good (not great) at Happy Hour prices.  What keeps it from getting a 5-star review from me are two things:1.  The food prices outside of Happy Hour seemed a little high for the food we tasted.2.  We decided to buy a 3-pack of Crowlers to take with us and were charged several dollars more than the price posted on a menu and on a very prominent sign by the bar.  When I asked about the different, the server said ""oh yeah, that sign's been wrong for a while.""  So... either fix the sign or charge customers what you advertised in multiple places!If back in Knoxville, I would absolutely come here for another Happy Hour, but probably skip it during other times of the day."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Atlee M.,"Knoxville, TN",5/22/2019,4.0,"Balter has the cool neighborhood meet up feel with the fun and class of a city hit spot. It is such a great place to meet up with friends during happy hour to relax at the end of the day, or grab something off of their fantastic new menu. We find ourselves going back over and over again because of the relaxed, friendly atmosphere. The servers are knowledgeable and kind. The food is packed with flavor at very reasonable prices. Alec and Crystal are our favorite servers!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Emily A.,"Athens, TN",9/18/2021,1.0,"Waited 20 minutes at a table without a server even acknowledging us. We had to walk over to the bar to order our own drinks. Spoke to a manager and he was very callous about the situation and only offered to ""find a server"". It's a bit ridiculous they couldn't assign a server to our table when we were seated. Do a better job of managing your restaurant."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Onomatopoeia O.,"Knoxville, TN",3/14/2021,1.0,"Updating due to learning of the MOST RIDICULOUSLY BAD (new-ish) HAPPY HOUR SCHEDULE.  Happy hour is updated to be 3PM to 5:30PM M-F (ONLY).  REALLY???  IT ENDS AT 5:30PM???  The WORST that I have seen ANYWHERE on the planet!  No disrespect to the following groups, but (unless you are in the trades, a landscaper, or a shift worker) a 3PM-5:30PM Happy Hour is SIMPLY LAME!!!  Be sure to read my entire prior 2 reviews by clicking the text below as they are all still 100% accurate."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Onomatopoeia O.,"Knoxville, TN",8/24/2019,3.0,"Zero ""Balter Society"" parties = breach of verbal contract!!!  Beer is usually poured into a very hot glass (not a good thing). They have OK prices for happy-hour and pint night ONLY and ONLY if you PAY $20. to join their ""society"" but usually VERY cramped inside at those times.  Happy hour only runs to 6:30 & is THE EARLIEST H. HOUR CUT-OFF TIME I KNOW OF IN KNOXVILLE.  Bar area literally clears out after happy hour which tells me that prices are to high otherwise (or people would not leave the minute that happy hour ends).  Place is always very loud and echoey.  Hipsters, posers, and meticulous beard-farmers are abundant among guests and staff with 25-30ish% being ""average Joes"".   When selling you on joining the ""Society"" they brag that they have complimentary member parties but I have yet to see one actually be executed.  They should freeze or (at a MINIMUM) cool the clean beer glasses instead of using the beer U drink to cool them down after they are VERY hot from dish washer (resulting in warmer beer for your consumption). Not sure what the thought process is to keep a HUGE bar window open in high humidity, 86 degree temps (to serve only 3 customers) while forcing about 150 other customers inside the building to endure their AC NOT KEEPING UP because of their (POOR CHOICE) to keep the window open! If the window is open to serve patio guests, then (if they haven't already) they should put a small bar outside instead of making everyone inside suffer bad AC!  AC also challenged by the fact that the building is a converted gas station and, as a result, has a LOT of windows (I did not notice any heat reflecting tinting either but I may have overlooked it)."

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kachine C.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",2/17/2020,5.0,Zach was such a great and helpful server. He pretty much picked my food for me and I couldn't be happier with what I got. Baja tacos w fries!! And they were absolutely amazing! We got mimosas and a Bloody Mary too and all were 10/10. I definitely recommend this place for any occasion!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Rachel H.,"Cincinnati, OH",7/25/2017,5.0,"Wonderful experience here. The atmosphere is great. It's rustic and modern. There are several large community tables but also smaller ones for more intimate seating. There's a great dog friendly patio as well. I was pleasantly surprised that the beer was so great. They have 4 standards and then they had a couple special ones. We tried three of the standards and the cask ale they had that day. They were all really good. The coffee porter tasted like coffee and was smooth and flavorful. The kolsch is super light and refreshing.  I had the Tillamook burger. It's cheddar, bacon, bbq. The bacon was delicious and there was plenty of it. The burger is two small patties but they are filling and they were cooked just right with tons of juices spilling out as I ate it. The mac and cheese looked underwhelming but had great flavor. You can definitely taste the garlic and onion and it was nice and creamy. Good service as well and it looked like they had a lot of local/small batch liquors. Wish I didn't live so far away!"

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",12/6/2017,3.0,"Came here on a Thursday night. It wasn't so busy, so you would think the service would be on point. Sadly, what I got here was a little disappointing. I love the beer that they have and I want to say this place is a solid 4 for beer.What I got today was ""The Beast"" burger. But for a $14.99 burger...it was a little pathetic. You would think for a $15 burger it would be big, loaded to the max, right? Nope. And let's just say, if you're on a low carb diet... Balter fails, I mean fails at lettuce wraps. Its not a big problem and can be easily fix, yet they probably won't.Why do I say they fail at lettuce wraps? I mean look at it! They just literally put two leaves on it. THIS IS NOT HOW A LETTUCE WRAP SHOULD BE. I know, I'm a little weird not eating carbs... But hey, everyone have their own tastes. Look, the way I see it, lettuce is cheap. And the more lettuce you put on a burger, the bigger it looks...so why don't you put more lettuce?? So I guess this is a warning for low carb, keto diet people... This isn't the place you're looking for if you're in that category. Overall, let's just say that the beer is good. The service was a bit slow, I think my waiter forgot that I ordered beer as it took forever to get... I'll probably come back, but for me Balter won't be of a place that I'll crave for."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",5/9/2016,4.0,"I've came here twice, and haven't written about both of my experiences. I came here for a dinner, and then a couple of weeks later I came here for Brunch. For my dinner experience:I think the beer by itself is definitely a reason to check this place out. The service was great, as our party was pretty big and was neatly seated on a long bench outside. I ordered the Balter burger, because well you know... if a burger is named after the restaurant it should symbolize and stand for their food. It was alright. It wasn't the worst, but it didn't ""wow"" me I guess? Move onto the craft beer: worth getting and drinking. All in all my dinner experience was great, nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing special in the food department. I do have to note that the Cookie Dessert...was awesome. If you're big on cookies and you like them warm, I would definitely recommend that.My brunch experience:I came back once again for a fellow meetup with yelp friends, but this time for the brunch and with the SO. What did I order? I got the blackened fish tacos, but the SO got the chicken and waffles. I got to try both. If I told you what to get, I would definitely try to push you towards the chicken and waffles. Don't get me wrong, the Blackened Fish Tacos were good, but it's chicken and waffles!Overall, both of my experiences were good and I look forward to my next visit, maybe to just get some brews or a hangout. All I know is that I can come here to get some chicken and waffles for brunch!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ben A.,"Murfreesboro, TN",12/22/2019,5.0,"We have ended up here late night several times over the past few months for some reason.  And every single time it has been outstanding.  First, the staff is awesome.  Every server has been crazy cool even with some of the large parties we have rolled in with.The beer is great for a small microbrewery, in a city saturated with small microbreweries.  The food is what has been so impressive to me.  The fried green tomatoes are one of the best small plates I have had anywhere this year.  We honestly have not had one bad thing there as we have worked through the menu.  We will definitely be back, hopefully next time to try brunch."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lee F.,"Knoxville, TN",12/5/2019,1.0,"Just left Balter after an EXTREMELY BAD experience with their front of house staff. To preface this review, Balter had been one of the places that my wife and I went to frequently. We enjoyed the happy hour specials, pint night Wednesday, and the spacious patio for sunny, afternoon beers. We enjoyed Balter to the point that we PAID OUR HARD EARNED MONEY to join the Balter Society of which the perks include being able to hop to the top of the waiting list and 20oz beers for the 16oz price. Fast forward to today... We have out of state family visiting for graduation. After a big day in the Smokies, 6 adults and 2 babies are obviously starving. We know that we have the situation under control and point the caravan to Balter. On the way, my wife calls to give them a heads up since it's a largeish party (we've both worked in food service and know a heads up can mean all the difference) and because we are Balter Society members and shouldn't have an issue being seated after the hour plus drive. The hostess tells us not that they aren't taking reservations but that they DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS (narrator: that was later determined to be a lie). We arrive in high spirits. Check in with the hostess at the door where we are told there are no tables in front of us and will be sat as soon as a table big enough to accommodate us opens. No big deal. Not only are we at the top of the list. We are ""BALTER SOCIETY"" too... remember. We order beers at the outside bar counter, wait, and enjoy our company/beverages. The wait seems to be getting longer and longer as we see parties as big as/bigger than ours depart. I'm not one to make a scene but I went to the hostess stand to inquire when I watched a party of 9, which arrived 5 minutes prior to a large table being cleared, be seated. All while we have been waiting for almost an hour with 2 small children and an earful of BS. The hostess smugly informed me that the reason they had been seated is they ""had a reservation"". A RESERVATION THAT WE WERE TOLD THEY DON'T ACCEPT AT ALL...NO EXCEPTIONS. So basically... Balter Society means that on busy nights you pay for the privilege of being lied to, insulted, and forced to go elsewhere for food and beverages. The handling of the situation was so poor that I'll make a point to direct anyone who will listen to drink at Pretentious/Crafty/Alliance and eat at Elkmont/Stock & Barrel/Jackie's/etc. I've never been insulted nor rudely treat at any of those places and the establishments are greater than or equal in quality. I'll miss those happy hour tacos doe.P.S. haven't returned since the terrible (perhaps racist or classist) customer service. Still happily spending my free time directing my friends, acquaintances, and tangential contacts away from this spot. The new construction wreaks havoc on getting there and parking. Also any place that reinforces a de facto caste system can take an automatic back seat to better establishments that don't aim to be okay/satisfactory at being middle of the road for food and beer. Go to pretentious for dank beer. Go to a number of spots for way better food in Knoxville. This is truly a place to eat and drink when you put no thought into it. I'll update continually because they not only treated me with some of the worst customer service I've ever had but deeply offended my ethnically diverse family."

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jay D.,"Baltimore, MD",2/3/2020,5.0,"My work-place used to come here when we held interviews with groups of 20-30+ people, and Balter always managed to handle everything with ease. On top of that, the beer is good, and the food is pretty great too - I love the potato chip nachos,  the burgers are all good, even the salads are on point. The staff is really polite, and the outdoor space is quaint with its string lights and picnic tables. In the summer, people bring their kids and dogs to the patio area and just straight up chill, which is really nice. Parking is limited, but there's extra space across the street and also up the stairs (if you're willing to walk up and down the stairs to get to and from your car). Overall, a really solid restaurant/taproom."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chelsea R.,"Knoxville, TN",3/23/2019,4.0,"Food was excellent as always. Came specifically to check out their Hux's Hot Chicken menu. The sandwich was bomb. We sat at the bar and the bartender kind of ignored us a lot, but we didn't really care as we were watching the SEC tournament anyways. Definitely a favorite local spot!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Taylor J.,"Atlanta, GA",9/1/2020,5.0,Best burger in town . Guacamole and chips is awesome as well. The weather is changing - enjoy the patio .
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Justin M.,"Bean Station, TN",2/8/2020,5.0,We go to Balter Beerworks quite often. They have fantastic beer. I am a fan of their Good Neighbor Kolsch while my wife loves their Bear Blend. They have excellent happy hour specials that include street tacos and sliders among other things. The street tacos are always my go to. It can get very crowded and hard to find a place to park at times. During certain times you can park across the street in an adjacent lot. It's definitely our favorite place in Knoxville to grab a beer and chat.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Robert S.,"Tullahoma, TN",8/31/2017,3.0,"Chill place to grab some good beer and food designed to enhance each other.   The Potato Chip Nachos were a great start.  They were fresh and delicious and unique.  The Shrimp and Grits was hearty and well-seasoned.  The atmosphere is comfortable and I did not feel rushed.  Right now, until construction on the road is complete, parking is tight and you may need to drive down the street a little bit to one of the other close parking lots."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Mj S.,"Middletown, NJ",8/12/2020,5.0,What an awesome spot to enjoy incredible blackened fish tacos!! The service was spot on !!Margaritas were super tasty and potent and the beers were creative and enjoyable !! Clean and friendly environment to enjoy a beautiful summer night!!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Cobren R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/8/2020,5.0,"Great restaurant!! As a local, it is one of my favorites. They have amazing blackened-fish tacos. All of there sides are delicious. Great vibe."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Amanda C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/25/2021,1.0,The server was extremely inattentive & it wasn't even busy. Took 20 minutes to even order our food and it was just ok. Doubt we would return.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Eileen R.,"Taunton, MA",9/28/2020,5.0,"Passing through the area and did a Google search for breweries...  Came to this one because of the ratings and the beer cheese soup.  Sadly they were out of the soup, BUT Zack and the rest of our meal and beer made the trip worthwhile!  If we pass through here again we'll definitely stop back in!  Zack, you ROCK!!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michael C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/21/2021,5.0,"The type of gem that deserves all of the business in the world, but selfishly wish it stayed a hidden gem to have all to myself"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jillian Z.,"Knoxville, TN",1/14/2021,5.0,Balter is hands down our absolute favorite restaurant in Knoxville - we go at least once a week. Their food is phenomenal and the service is always SO SO good. They are extremely pet friendly and love our sweet girl Stella! We have never been disappointed with a menu item and my fiancé loves their beer! They have a great wine selection and full bar as well! We will never stop coming to Balter as long as we live in Knoxville.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Katie O.,"Old Seminole Heights, Tampa, FL",6/12/2018,5.0,"Do yourself a favor and check this place out! The beer and the food are amazing and pair well together. During our visit, our waiter Niles was extremely helpful when guiding us through the menu and when giving us advice on what to check out during our stay in Knoxville. As recommended, we started with a few drinks. My boyfriend started with the Firebelly IPA and I chose a flight of Hoppy Holler, Maypop, Good Neighbor and Firebelly. All of these beers are delicious and paired well with my food, but Hoppy Holler is my favorite, so we left with a crowler. To eat my boyfriend and I split a salad and burger since our waiter insisted it was no big deal to split in the kitchen. We started with the Mediterranean Salad, which could easily be one of the best salads I've ever had. Toppings include tomatoes, marinated green olives, cucumbers, feta cheese and chickpeas. Writing about it is making me hungry... Next, we split the Tillamook Burger with a side of potato chips and asparagus. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the best flavored burger I've ever eaten. The food was incredible and our waiter gave us the impression that most of the menu is fantastic. We went for a late lunch on a Monday so we didn't get a feel for the crowd that attends, but we still had great conversation with our waiter. Our total bill was $50 with a flight, two beers (one priced lower for Happy Hour), a salad, burger and crowler. If we're ever in Knoxville again, we'll be sure to stop here."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Reema P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",11/19/2019,5.0,Every time I have come here the service has been great! J even got a discount on beer once for biking there which was neat! They have a great selection and I always get the flights and the people are friendly. What more can you ask for?!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Rochelle S.,"Las Vegas, NV",9/7/2020,5.0,"We loved this place! I eat gluten free so I was a bit worried when I saw the menu only listed 2 salads as GF! But they have gf buns and their Balter Burger was AMAZING! The potato chip nachos were also amazing! There were 6 of us and we ALL loved our food! The service was a tad bit slow but they were busy and it seems like with covid everything has slowed down a bit! Definitely check them out if you're looking for fun ambiance, friendly service and great food."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chris L.,"Winchester, VA",6/20/2021,5.0,Our favorite brewery when visiting Knoxville and now a top food spot! Fish tacos and mahi wrap were delicious! Our server Landon was excellent as well!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Cass G.,"Knoxville, TN",8/4/2020,5.0,Great atmosphere!  I had a burger in the patio with some friends.  Located directly behind the law school I think I will be spending lots of time here this semester.  The tacos looked great and I look forward you trying them next time!  Great service
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Emma C.,"Charleston, SC",9/4/2019,5.0,"Great ambiance and happy hour! My mom and I stopped off here at 3 in the afternoon- 2 beers, 2 apps, 2 sliders, and 2 tacos later- we only owed $23! Our server Kole was the real MVP- very attentive, but never pushy. He kept out drinks refilled and even offered to-go containers and bags when he saw we were slowing down on eating. Will definitely be back and plan to ask for Kole again!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chris A.,"Greenville, SC",8/10/2019,4.0,"Wow, picked a different spot to grab some lunch on the way back to SC and this is a very neat place to stop off in.  Plenty of outdoor seating (but I opted for the good old A/C seating.)  Since I still had some distance to travel, I went with one of the burgers (don't remember the name but it was the 8oz over the 4 oz options) and the grilled veggies. Such a gooey and yummy mess. It was good to get in a little early before the crowd hit and it hit big by the time that I had left. Definitely a stop on the next trip thru Knox."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Rebecca G.,"Surprise, AZ",7/15/2020,5.0,Came here on a recommendation and we weren't disappointed. Had the street fish tacos...they were amazing! The appetizer came with 4 tacos and they were full of fish. Some of the best fish tacos I've had.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chris B.,"Knoxville, TN",3/9/2020,1.0,"Had a dreadful experience here tonight (9 Mar 20). Waited for almost an hour for a table. Took over 10 minutes to place drink order. Took another 15 minutes to place food order. Took about 30 minutes for food to come out. Food quality was abysmal. Side items were inedible. My fried fish entree was served at room temperature. Just a very, very bad experience overall. Server was nice though."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kleopatra G.,"Nashville, TN",2/23/2020,2.0,"I was expecting greatness all around from all these 5 star reviews, but sometimes you just can't trust yelpers! This was the case at Balter Beerworks. Came in hungry and slightly intoxicated from spending our wait time at Whiskey Works down the street(highly recommend). I went over to the breakfast bar that comes with every brunch entree and it was just bowls of disappointment. The pasta salad didn't have any salt let alone any seasoning. Everything was so bland, I almost thought I was being pranked. The fried green tomato benedict was not good, the biscuit was so dry and crumbly. The breakfast potatoes were good but they were mostly crispy skins so I didn't enjoy them either. I will say our server saved our experience. He was so nice and we could tell he was swamped. I appreciated his attitude. I might come back for happy hour but never for food because we both left hungry and unsatisfied."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kachine C.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",2/17/2020,5.0,Zach was such a great and helpful server. He pretty much picked my food for me and I couldn't be happier with what I got. Baja tacos w fries!! And they were absolutely amazing! We got mimosas and a Bloody Mary too and all were 10/10. I definitely recommend this place for any occasion!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Matt C.,"Maryville, TN",2/15/2020,5.0,Something about Balter Beer works. They dont even make shakes yet all the boys and girls come to the yard. The beer and premium adult  beverages flow like the salmon of capistrano.The folks bringing the beverages and food  are always all smiles. Just saying balter makes you smile and knowing the meaning will make you laugh.The menu has all the flavors. The burgers stand out but everything is delicious. High recommended a visit if you haven't and if you have I know you're recommend it too.Cheers to Knoxville
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Hannah G.,"Knoxville, TN",2/14/2020,2.0,"Great Sunday brunch - we've decided that's really the only day we'll go to put up with the line and service. We've actually only had good service on Sundays... Every other time we have went its like we were totally forgotten. So bad that we had literally no where else to be that day but my boyfriend had to get up and go ask another server to bring us our check because our server had disappeared for the longest time (we were outside). Something else that really irked me was whenever we sit outside, they have these drainage holes and the man busing the table was literally just throwing all of the drinks down the drain - straw and all. I said something to him and he laughed and let me know they were biodegradable straws which made me feel better but everytime he would carelessly empty a glass - it would splash everywhere which was just annoying at the lack of thought for the others around him."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Otaku G.,"New Tazewell, TN",2/10/2020,5.0,Holy shit this place is good I recommend the breakfast bowl also in the patio area there is these igloo things you can sit in and eat and they have heaters in it! I'm too young to have the beer though.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michael S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/10/2020,5.0,"This place has it all: great food, great beer, and an AWESOME happy hour!Most recently was there for happy hour on a Wednesday. I got full off of a few chicken sliders (they're so delicious - definitely my favorite thing on the menu), an order of chips and queso (it was like artisan chips and queso), and a firebelly IPA. Perfect happy hour combination.Something to note their happy hour goes from 3-6:30 - and towards the end it can get pretty loud. The place isn't that big - it used to be an old service station - and with a lot of folks crammed into a tight space for happy hour it can get a little noisy. I say this because I once went there for an after work meeting to discuss some  business. By the end of it, we were screaming to hear each other. Great place to hang out with friends - not so great for a work meeting."

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jay D.,"Baltimore, MD",2/3/2020,5.0,"My work-place used to come here when we held interviews with groups of 20-30+ people, and Balter always managed to handle everything with ease.

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Aaron C.,"Whitsett, NC",5/21/2019,5.0,"Today was my first time at Balter Beerworks for lunch. I was absolutely astonished by the service provided at this establishment. The service was very fast and my waiter was absolutely the nicest later I have had in a very long time. The beer here is fantastic and some of the best beer I've ever had. I have been to several establishments and tried various brews that are made in house and this place by far has some of the best I have ever had! My phone was dying and the waiter was kind enough to provide me With a phone charger so I could charge my phone! And I have heard of this place and I have only heard good things about this place. I am happy to say my first experience here was just as good, if not better than those I've heard! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice, chill place to come have lunch or dinner! They have both indoor and outdoor seating. I love the environment as well. The brewer at this establishment personally greeted be and thanked me for the compliment on the beer I had here! The food was fantastic! I cannot wait to come back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Robert B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/17/2019,5.0,"Consistently great!Pros:  We went to the Low Country Shrimp Boil.  YUM!  A bit pricey but worth it.  Great shrimp.  Our waitress, Mikala, was awesome.  Very swift and attentive.  It was super busy, but she was more than able to keep up.  You would do well to ask to be seated in her section.  Mikala, you are delightful!  The Good Neighbor ale is crisp and clean and not to bitter.  I like lagers but I understand when only ales are available.Cons:  No biggie but we sat in a booth that had a bright light shining in our face.  I covered it with a napkin.  Sun can be right in your eyes too, but they have installed shades.  I should have closed them myself.  It is NOISY but it was Friday after work and everyone was in the mood to party.  The have made an effort to soften some of the surfaces and it has helped.  I'm just sensitive to noise.  These issues are small and in no way detract from the excellent job they do.  Bring back the brussels sprouts!Mikala, you deserve a raise!  Have your boss read this.  You can't go wrong with Balter!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Robert B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/8/2016,4.0,"New micro-brewery.  Gave it 4 stars based on potential (tempted to rate 3 stars).  We had a great time.  We sat on the patio for a couple of beers before going inside for dinner.  Great atmosphere.  I really liked the ironwork and glass on the front of the building.  Good place for an occasional date night.  Brewery is detached from all else and I forgot to check it out.  Full bar, not beer only. Pros:  Good service, good beer, great meal, Brussels sprouts appetizer is a must have.  Wife had the salmon and I had shrimp and grits, both good.  I love the architecture.  Restrooms are clean beautiful.  Cons:  Noisy as all get-out.  Concrete wall on one side, glass and steel on the other.  Soften all these hard surfaces!  I hate having to yell across the table to be heard.  Sorely in need of shades on the windows.  Sun right in our eyes.  Many guest moved from table to table to avoid the sun.  Too many tables on the patio.  Servers could not make it between our table and the others, very annoying.  Umbrellas were in the way too.  You had to duck down to move through the patio.  Entrance is a bit difficult to find.  First door I tried was locked. The second was open but then I had to find the hostess station.  Hostess station is at a third door which is not naturally accessible.  Parking was lacking.  I'm not sure if there is more down the street.  Chair backs inside leaned back so far they were basically useless.  Expensive, our bill was $80.00 for a few beers, appetizer and dinner for two.  It is new and needs to work out a few issues."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jack L.,"Greenville, SC",2/13/2019,5.0,"I've been coming here time after time and am always happy. The happy hour beers are a great deal and the beer is good quality. I always get the Maypop IPA for $3 during happy hour, but the rotating seasonal shave always been top notch too. Happy hour food includes tacos, chicken sliders, hummus, and beef sliders. The fish tacos are great! A great place with a great vibe."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jack L.,"Greenville, SC",3/6/2017,4.0,"I have been coming to Knoxville for about a year now, and I have always wanted to try this place. I finally was able to stop in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. I sat at the bar and looked over the menu. It wasn't very large, but I saw a salad that piqued my interests. I am generally a fan of cobb salads at most establishments, so I settled on that selection. I wasn't disappointed. The salad had a great array of toppings, which were numerous and sufficient enough to meet the stringent Jack Salad Ratio standards. The salad dressing I believe was a champagne vinaigrette and it, too, was tasty. The beer selection looked eclectic, and if I weren't here for lunch and working, I would have imbibed. This only leaves me more excited for my next visit, in which I will partake in the various fermented beverages."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jessica S.,"TN, TN",12/20/2017,5.0,"My favorite place in Knoxville. I love to go here for dates or to bring family or friends from out of town or just to hang out. Beer 10/10. Consistent and excellent. The bear blend (coffee oatmeal stout) is one of the best coffee brews I've ever had. So smooth, I love it more than the famed ""gotta get up to get down"" brew from the wiseacre brewery in Memphis. Love their seasonal brews and guest brews so far as well. If not for the calories I would get a flight every time I came here.Food 10/10. My significant other loves their veggie burger. We each vouch for the street tacos. The chicken sliders are a guilty pleasure of mine. The fun little pickled garnish on the appetizer plates is something I really enjoy- either pickled cauliflower, carrot or garlic usually. Right now we are in love with their salads, got the jackson avenue salad last time which is SO GENEROUS with the greens, lovely house made vinaigrette is not overpowering, pecans and bleu cheese are perfect with grilled chicken for your protein. I could get it every time."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Julia H.,"Hiawatha, IA",2/25/2021,5.0,Stopped with my husband on the way to Nashville.  Balter Burger and Brewhouse were our choices and excellent.  Enjoyed the amber and kolsch beer also.  Huge outdoor area.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,K M.,"Milton, FL",9/3/2018,5.0,Are there enough superlatives to describe our experience?  We stopped in for lunch.  Our aunt had fish and chips.  She said it was very good but the tartar sauce was the best she had ever had. Our daughter said the cheese grits rivaled any she had in New Orleans.  She really enjoyed her gruyere grilles cheese sandwich. Daughter's boyfriend had the club sandwich. It tasted incredible.  He was very pleased with his selection. I had a soup and salad combination.  The beer cheese soup was exceptional.  It had a wonderful combination of flavors.  I highly recommend it.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Will T.,"Knoxville, TN",1/31/2019,5.0,"Here I go again.. I've been to Balter a couple times since they opened. The first time was with a few friends from work, and I only had beers. I remember liking the beers and the room.Then a few months after that I went with my wife and sister. This time I did have food, but it's been a few years and I don't recall what any of us had. But I remember it was good.Then today I again met with some friends for beers and lunch. I ordered the Balter burger. And it was served in either 4 ounce or ten ounce. So I ordered the big one.OMG. It was the best burger I've had in a very long time. And it was huge! I had to do the Guy Fieri ""Hunch"" just to take my first bite. Good thing the napkins are big, I had to grab it after every bite.Great beers, excellent burgers, and the perfect place to meet. We ate at the bar, and the bartender was friendly and service was great.We all used to meet for lunch at the brewery on Gay street, but I'm afraid from now on when I'm downtown I'll be at Balter. Great place without question."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Luke L.,"Knoxville, TN",3/7/2019,5.0,"Went here twice on my trip to Knoxville from California! The service and hospitality was unmatched and the food, even better. My group and I were greeted and seated immediately. With the purchase of a main dish, you also get access to their breakfast bar which can be a full meal in itself! This was, by far, the most notable restaurant during my visit and I look forward to coming back in the future!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Mark M.,"Hendersonville, TN",9/5/2020,4.0,We arrived on a Saturday and put our name on the waitlist.  Initial eta was 45 minutes but it was only about 10.  Food was great and service as well.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Toby C.,"Seneca, SC",8/4/2020,5.0,Absolutely if you are anywhere close to this place then you really need to make the stop! The food was great!!! Top 5 best shrimp and grits I have ever had!! Fried green tomatoes were also so good. The tacos were phenomenal and the sliders as well. Drinks were also just really good. Make an effort to stop in.

I'd never been here before, but was immediately impressed by the open, sunny, chic industrial interior.Our party was seated at a long pair of tables.I thought service might be off with a large group, but it was excellent. Friendly and fast.The food was excellent across the board.We tried the potato chip nacho appetizer. Addictive.I had a salmon salad that was huge and tasty and included fresh baby asparagus and peas. I really enjoyed it,I tasted my colleague's avocado shrimp and it was great, too.In fact everyone in the party enjoyed their food, from wraps, to sandwiches, to salads.I regret that I didn't get to sample the drinks menu, but I'll be back to try them another time for sure."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Vanessa N.,"Norcross, GA",9/12/2017,4.0,"Balter is the place to drink good beer, have nice dinner, enjoy good company, and stay away from the downtown crowd. For a place that is known for its beer, the food is delicious. If you don't know what to get, try the Brewhouse Burger, the potato chip nachos and don't forget to get the cookie skillet dessert! The service has been hit and miss for us, but for the most part, it has been good. (Please fix some of the parasols!)"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Amanda Y.,"Orlando, FL",6/9/2020,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic. We stopped here on our way up north, and it was so good we made it a point to stop on our way back as well. Everything we've had has been delicious - the fish tacos, Nashville hot sliders, brownie skillet, and fried green tomatoes. The beer is great as well. They really care about their food and customer experience, and we're bummed this place isn't local to us. We will definitely be back every time we're around Knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Rachel C.,"Center City, Philadelphia, PA",10/14/2019,5.0,I took my mom here for a night out and we absolutely loved it! I had a Balter burger with Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. This was very ambitious and I didn't come close to finishing. Everything was delicious! The burger was especially great. Love the buns they use. I will definitely be coming back for their raspberry beer. It tastes as good as it looks!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Rose M.,"Johnson City, TN",8/11/2019,4.0,"Tasty beer and good food. The produce is fresh, colorful, and crunchy. Prices are good, portions are large, and they don't mind splitting up plates to share. Downside...the place is loud, parking is limited, and service is slow."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,John T.,"Cincinnati, OH",10/7/2019,5.0,"Food was great! Atmosphere is even better! Their new Oktoberfest is better than a local German brewery. Jesse was our server and you can't ask for better service. Great table presence and recommendations on cocktails, too!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kevin A.,"Burbank, CA",4/17/2021,3.0,Nothing about this place stands out. Just a regular place to get a regular meal with like 2015 LA vibes.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Teri O.,"Redington Shores, FL",7/29/2020,4.0,"Okay-we are here almost weekly. We came last Saturday. It just started raining and we were seated inside at bar high top. Now, this review is ONLY based upon Covid regulations enforcement. Everyone had on masks (servers as well as patrons) BUT..one group of mid 20's young men(6-8)  rolled right thru the door in front of us and into the restaurant to a table. No one bothered to tell them masks REQUIRED(not recommended) Then the rain poured and people ran inside. Several people crowded our table and were in ""our eating space"". At least 3 times the manager walked by and instead of directing them to the outside ""covered"" area to wait until a table opens. It was uncomfortable for us.Very disappointed at enforcing protocols when everyone else is trying to abide. Management  needs to make sure staff will ENFORCE the mandate."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jared M.,"Madison, AL",2/21/2017,5.0,"I love the attention to detail in everything at Balter. First, the beer. Will R. brews amazing beer - the new Belgian IPA is perfect - with the precision of an engineer. The food is more than glorified bar food. The fried chicken - whether tenders or sliders - is the best in Knoxville. Have the new hot chicken version on Mondays, and be blown away by the unique smokiness. And I love the space. The building, brewery, comfy-industrial interior, metal & glass exterior, the patio, the beer garden. There's nothing else like this in Knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Paige H.,"Powell, TN",3/9/2019,5.0,"This was our first visit here, we had heard great things about it so had high expectations! We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Our waitress was really nice, explained the beers and said if we needed anything to let her know! We ordered our food and waited maybe 10-15 minutes on it to arrive. Everything was phenomenal! I had the Baja tacos-came with 2 fish tacos, fully dressed along with dirty rice and charro beans. My hubby got the hot chicken blt, he said it was great, not Nashville hot chicken hot, but it was still great! We will definitely be back. The only downside was parking and if it hadn't been raining the walk would've been fine!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Colin C.,"Oak Ridge, TN",3/17/2020,5.0,"A COMPLETE staple of the Knoxville happy hour scene. Great beer, killer food, and the best damn prices for happy hour that I think you'll find anywhere. Oh, and the place is REALLY well laid out - great patio, great front porch, and plenty of space in the restaurant and the bar. Balter is a favorite for sure."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ariana S.,"Alpharetta, GA",7/2/2019,4.0,"I really enjoyed going here. I need to go during happy hour, because I know they have $2 sliders and $3 drafts! I need to be a part of that. The sliders were really good, chicken was juicy and I loved the coleslaw on it. The bread was still crispy as well. I took my pickle off because I'm just not a fan of pickles. Only downside is it can get really crowded and there isn't much parking. Menu can get a little pricey too. Besides that, I enjoyed my food!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Adam A.,"Duncan, SC",6/18/2018,5.0,"We had brunch here and it was fantastic!  We sat outside at a picnic table that we shared with another group of people. Great environment. Lidia, our server took great care of us. The food is out of control. I had a burger with sweet potato fries, we also had avocado toast and southern Benedict. All great. They all come with a brunch bar with a variety of salads and sweets. Now for the drinks, get the Balter Bloody Mary it's the best I've ever had! And get the carafe of mimosas. I can't wait to come back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Polly D.,"Mebane, NC",12/29/2018,4.0,"Excellent find on our one night in Knoxville. Great atmosphere, diverse menu, and terrific beer selection. There is a fire pit and a lit of seating outside.We started off with a flight of beer to get to sample lots of options. All were quite delicious, I ended up going with the cherry and my husband opted for another (but neither of is can remember which one).After seeing pictures on yelp we decided to get an order of the chip nachos- everyone including my 7 year old loved them. For dinner my husband got the jambalaya and I had the wedge salad. Our dinners were quite satisfying. The kid had the chicken fingers....he said they were good and cleaned his plate but let's face it he likes McDonalds and still eats his own boogers so not exactly the best judge of culinary success. He did talk us in to the skillet cookie for dessert which was amazing. The only negative was the kitchen was a bit slow, not enough to be annoying but slow enough I just cant give them the 5 stars I would have otherwise."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Joey D.,"Knoxville, TN",12/19/2016,5.0,"Delicious beer and great food here.  I love Balter.  And, it's about 100 yards from my apartment, which is both awesome and dangerous.  I think most have said how great this place is already, so I won't go too crazy.  However, the meditteranean chicken salad is terrific.  AND, go for brunch.  This is an awesome downtown brunch spot.  And, they have parking. Boom."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kelly H.,"Collierville, TN",6/3/2017,4.0,"A cool addition to the Knoxville area.  Proprietary taps with varied beers. We tried several different brews. The spouse was not enamored with the IPA, but he liked the APA and the dunkel. I tasted a couple before settling on the Kolsch and even better the guest offering cider. For food we loved the dip appetizer with really good pimento cheese as well as hummus, pita, olives and pickled veggies. The carmelized Brussels sprouts sounded too good to pass up, but were too sweet for me. The spouse had one of the grilled cheeses with chips and the offspring got the shrimp and grits which looked to be the best order. Nice atmosphere and outdoor space. Good service."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Julie B.,"Flowery Branch, GA",6/18/2017,4.0,"I love the atmosphere of this place.  It was hot as ... outside so no one was sitting on the patio, but I could see how that would be popular during certain times of the year.  I sat at the bar which was empty when I got there and then quickly filled up - it was an in between lunch and dinner time sort of stop.  I wanted to try all of their beers, 6 when I was there.  The flight gets you 4 and then the bartender graciously gave me a taste of the other two.  I would have paid for them, so maybe think about selling individual samples?  I am a beer snob, let's get that out of the way.  I thought the beers were mostly just alright.  I love my pale ales and IPAs.  These were typical run of the mill ones, nothing special.  The kolsch turned out to be my favorite so I got that.  They did serve it in a correct glass, not that I am that snobby, but I noticed.  They also have a few guest taps.  Now the food...it was really hard to pick.  I wanted the potato chip nachos because Yelpers really went on and on about them and the pictures, wow!  But I was by myself and the thought of eating a plate of potato chips wasn't appealing.  I ended up with the black bean oat burger with house cut French fries.  That was definitely good enough to come back for.  I don't live in the area.  If I did I might go elsewhere for beer and come here for food.  I think your typical non-snobby beer drinker will find their beer is just fine by them.  They did offer several different styles."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Amber K.,"Oak Creek, WI",7/5/2020,5.0,Meal was spectacular! The food is great quality and margarita was awesome. Alec was a great waitor. Came here on the Fourth of July because we were out of town and the staff was all in good spirits to be working on a holiday.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Maria T.,"Worcester, MA",1/2/2021,5.0,Our server Alec was awesome- went over the menu and beer choices!!!   The breakfast bowl with an over easy egg was AMAZING! Fresh products fused into perfection!!!  ...and waffle and chicken far exceeded expectations! The Hoppy Holler beer was well balanced and the Good Neighbor was also perfect! Next time we are in Knoxville- this will be our first stop!!!  Thanks for a great brunch!!!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Addy R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/29/2021,5.0,Food is so delicious!! Went there for the beer and ended up falling in love with the food. Great atmosphere as well!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Amanda C.,"Cedar Bluff, Knoxville, TN",3/18/2019,5.0,Burgers and beer were great! Me and my friend sat at the bar late on a Saturday and Jake was awesome! We will definitely be back to try the other menu items!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Iva C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/30/2018,4.0,"Balter is an awesome place to hit up for good food and drinks. The atmosphere is comfortable and the food is great. The only downside to this place is the parking. They have a pretty small parking lot so when it's full it can be tricky to find a spot, but there are usually spots across the street if it's full. They have a wonderful selection of burgers and the entire menu sounds delicious. I always have a hard time choosing what to order because it all sounds good. Last night my friends and I ordered the chicken sandwich, brewhouse burger, and the meatloaf, which was one of their seasonal specials. It was all wonderful and we really enjoyed our meals! They obviously have a good selection of beer, but if you're not a beer drinker they have tasty cocktails as well! There is something for everyone here. Next time I would like to go for their brunch because I've heard it's amazing. Overall this place is always consistent and I always enjoy my time here."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Daniel G.,"Chicago, IL",1/1/2017,5.0,"Stopped in because it was the only thing open on New Year's Day. Fantastic choice. I got the black bean and oat burger while my honey bunches of oats got the burrito bowl.The burger is a very rare find, a veggie burger that isn't salty, but has a crispy crust similar to a beef burger. The asparagus side was also grilled perfectly. I was very happy with my late night dinner. The burrito bowl was very large and equally flavorful. The chicken was juicy and the other fillings blended nicely together. I also had a flight of their beer selections and highly recommended the dark beers if you enjoy strong porter/stout flavors."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ben R.,"Tampa Bay, FL",11/26/2019,4.0,"4-stars for the food, wow! Chicken piccata was phenomenal, the salad was standard, the sliders were good however the Hux sauce could use some work, and the fried green tomatoes were super fancy. While the beers were really good, they took quite some time to make it to us (20 or so minutes). There were a few discrepancies in the bill such as things we had not received being on there or incorrect add ons, but the waitress ultimately fixed the billing. I would suggest adding a waitress or two, otherwise, plan to spend an enjoyable 1.5 hours at this cozy location."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bryan V.,"Vancouver, WA",3/14/2020,4.0,"The fish tacos are awesome the Balter Burger is the bomb, great beer we sat out on the patio. The prices are fair great service."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Rachel H.,"Los Angeles, CA",11/22/2018,4.0,"Went here for lunch on a Monday, wasn't busy at all. I have been here several times before in the evening when it is usually too loud for my taste. They just started their winter seasonal menu. I tried the gruyere grilled cheese with tomato basil soup both were really good. We ordered the apple crumble for dessert, it was sadly quite burnt when they brought it to us, but they replaced it and the second was cooked perfectly and we weren't charged for the dessert. Overall, I nice place, I plan to go back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ciera S.,"South Loop, Chicago, IL",8/31/2018,5.0,"Wow! Simply wow! We went for lunch while visiting from Kansas City, MO. The food was phenomenal and the beer was great. I'm kind of a beer snob and I was genuinely impressed! I got the IPA and my girlfriend got the Summer Pale. Both were delicious, not overly hoppy and nice clean finishes. We split the Mediterranean salad  (the kitchen actually split it on two plates for us) and for our entrees I had the Gruyere grilled cheese with a local beef patty added; my girlfriend has the chicken pita. Both of us loved the food. What made the experience even better was our server Ryan. He was incredibly accommodating and helpful. I ordered everything by his recommendations and he even brought my girlfriend a jalapeño remoulade without us asking, just because he knew it'd taste great with her sandwich. 10/10 would recommend and revisit."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ali P.,"Atmore, AL",2/4/2020,5.0,"Delicious food and amazing craft beer! they have fabulous brunch specials and in my opinion, the best salads in town!!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Laura S.,"Key Largo, FL",7/12/2016,5.0,"We sat at the open bar area to take advantage of the beautiful day and bar service Laura was our server / bartender and was excellent -  running around in 5 different directions,  but cheery, professional, personable  and always aware of all her guests - inside and outside Food...,Ordered the blackened fish tacos which were served with a hard blue corn taco wrapped in a grilled flour tortilla, loaded with fish and toppings  -   Excellent fresh flavor served hot. The  beans and rice were good but we filled up on tacos so barely ate them Drinks....Amazing Habibitini !   Going to the distillery just a half block away to continue to try their local liquor options Beer flight was good - my husband loved seeing a cask ale as an option   Keep those coming! The servers all awesome but obviously stations were not well laid out or too big or some one called in sick.   You can tell the staff worked together and I saw the kitchen crew bringing food out as well.  Love that (as a former restaurant person)  seeing teams work together SuggestionWith the guest beers list you should note location of brewery. We looked them up ( 4 Knox and 1 Asheville) More parking please !!I would also note on your menu that the distillery is only a half block away.   What a cool thing! We will be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Adam F.,"Easton, MD",8/14/2018,5.0,"The services was Fantastic. Our waitress had nothing but southern Charm! Sliders were outstanding. Beef, spicy chicken, fried chicken and Blackened fish tacos. Don't pass on these amazing sandwiches. Hit Happy hour if you can and save a bunch. Americana Amber ale was perfect."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Loftis B.,"Philadelphia, TN",9/2/2018,4.0,"Dear Husband and I recently went back to Balter Beerworks after two years between visits. Yeah. Two years? Why was I waiting so long?!I do not know, but it will NOT be two years before I visit again.Last time I went, I had a not-great waitress, I chose a not-awesome dish, and the crowd that night was really loud.Talk about a completely different experience!This time, our waitress was great -- very helpful, especially since we bonded over very sensitive palates -- the food was *all* *awesome* -- and the drinks were totally fabulous. And the loud people didn't show up! Wow! What a difference that makes!!!Seriously, last time I was really put off by the very thoughtless server we had. It makes a world of difference to get a helpful and pleasant server. She was especially helpful when choosing between fish tacos. Balter has two kinds, and they both sound *kind of* spicy when you read the menu. I asked our server if the Baja fish tacos were hot, and she was emphatic about how those were her favorites, and she had a really sensitive palate for hot, spicy food. *I* have a really sensitive palate for hot, spicy food!!! This is info I can really appreciate!!!I ordered the Baja fish tacos with complete confidence that I wasn't about to eat food that would hurt.In the meantime, Dear Husband ordered a wedge salad and an appetizer -- the fried chicken sliders -- for his dinner.He also got a beer flight and chose the options based on our waiter's descriptions. She steered him right on the beers, too! The food was amazing -- the fried chicken sliders are only eclipsed by the Baja fish tacos, y'all -- and the drinks were *right on*. I got the Jackson Avenue Mule, I think, a Knoxville twist on a Moscow Mule, and it was so delicious, I could have saved it for dessert.Honestly, I can't wait to go back. It was a completely different experience from the last time we went. Yum!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lori W.,"Knoxville, TN",4/9/2016,5.0,"I have toured alot of ""beer"" breweries and this place is top notch. I'm not a beer drinker but I do like food and appetizers and this place has all three.This place was very busy as the Rhythm & Blooms Festival is going on. I met a couple from Maryland, Yes, Maryland!! They came down to see the Mavericks at the festival and stopped in here. They also couldn't believe how clean and nicely decorated this place was. This is one of The newest ones in town, they are popping up everywhere-The potato chip nachos and the brussel sprout app. were pretty good especially on a cold night. It hit the spot.It's much bigger then it looks on the inside. My phone died as I checked in until I got back to my vehicle, so I couldn't get any pictures but, I will be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bailey T.,"Maryville, TN",12/28/2020,4.0,Food was delicious! Did have some trouble getting our app out in a timely manner (took over 30 min and it was an empty restaurant) they took it off our ticket. Would definitely get the potato chip nachos again! Add chicken if you get them!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Gia S.,"Philadelphia, PA",7/29/2016,5.0,"Where to start? We stopped by for dinner and drinks after a stranger recommended this place to us at a beer tasting we attended. There is outdoor seating, a patio, bar seating, and tables inside. We went on a Friday evening and they were packed. We were told it was a 20-30 minute wait but luckily we were seated in about 5-10.We started off with a flight of their own brewed beer, and they were all really good, especially the Kosch and Wheat beers. We also tried the Yeehaw Berliner Weiss but that was a lot more tart than anticipated. For appetizers, we started with the beer cheese nachos and they were out of this world. The beer cheese soup was also really good.For dinner, I had the mac and cheese. It somehow tasted a little bland, so I asked for a side of beer cheese and poured it on the Mac and cheese and it was amazing. My boyfriend had the beast burger, which was really good but definitely heavy on the ingredients and will leave you in a food coma.Our waitress was helpful, the beer was great, and the food was incredible. My only tip is that they should really make soft pretzels to go with that beer cheese. I'm sure we'll be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Vivienne R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/22/2020,4.0,Very nice place.  Comfortable with good beer and burgers!  The service was great once we got seated.  The hostess was on the phone and couldn't even acknowledge us.  So we sat ourselves.  Our server was great!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chris A.,"Knoxville, TN",8/20/2020,5.0,Me and my wife came to meet my son for dinner. Normally I would get the burger which is fantastic but I tried the fish and chips.  I am a self proclaimed Fish and Chips snob but my man Zach said they we awesome. I tried them and he was wrong. They were over the top fantastic. My wife had the Miso Salmon which she loved as well. Get to Balter soon and ask for Zach if possible. I will be back soon.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/8/2016,4.0,"Came here for the grand opening and it was extremely grand. I ordered a veggie burger and didn't know it was coming with a side of fries. My veggie burger was a meat burger..I had to confirm it with 2 meat eaters because sometimes veggie burgers really do taste like meat! The owner, maybe, swapped it for me and asked what side I wanted. They have so many options for side! I went with the mac and cheese and it was so cheesy! Yum. They have a wide range of drinks too but I didn't try any because I left my ID in the car which was parked behind the theatre - I wasn't up for the walk again. I later found out I could have parked at the garage for free..I had a mocktail and I was content. I have zero alochol tolerance anyways. As for the dessert. That was grand! A huge chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. Yum Yum! The best part of a meal will always be the dessert. I ate more than the other peeps I was sharing with. It was so warm, moist, chewy and the chocolate chips were gooing. Now that's a legit cookie! The ambience is great for socializing and hanging out."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Dean C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/1/2019,5.0,"This is our new favorite place! The vegetarian burger is awesome. The place is always busy so expect a wait during peak times. Oh, and the bear is outstanding."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jeana H.,"Providence, RI",8/19/2018,5.0,"Balter is the kind of place you can always rely on for great food and a great atmosphere. Although located at the corner of a busy street, Balter has one of the best outdoor spaces in downtown Knoxville. Now for the important part- the food at Balter is A++! I typically go for happy hour and love to munch on the chicken sliders and fish tacos. The happy hour specials on sliders, tacos, and beer is a deal! For dinners and lunch, I recommend the salmon salad. I have tried most the dishes on their menu and all are amazing!The service is always top notch. Balter is a spot I return week after week."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Olga N.,"Knoxville, TN",2/11/2016,5.0,"4.5 if we're splitting hairs, but WHO CARES?!  Guys...this place...is awesome.  My only con would be that it's INSANELY crowded.  Standing room only.  This is a problem for me, not for Balter.  I grew up on the other side of the Henley St. Bridge and passed this old gas station in seedy downtown Knoxville a million times as a kid.  Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined it could look or function in this capacity.  To see cars lined up and down Jackson Ave. for all the new places popping up in this section of town just gives me the goofiest grin.  The comradery is really nice to see, too-- they proudly serve Knox Whiskey Works' spirits, which is just down the block.  The beer:  We have many skilled brewers in Knoxville, and that number seems to increase daily.  That being said, Will Rutemeyer, I tip my hat to you, sirs.  I dare say the Jackson Abbey may be my favorite beer, not just in Knoxville, but in life thus far.  I was physically taken aback at how delicious it was.  I followed this with the 8-6-Rye, also delicious.  My boyfriend drank the Maypop and Firebelly, settling on the Firebelly as his favorite of the evening.  I sampled both, and both were wonderful.  I've had IPAs that want to be like the Firebelly but ended up tasting like Pine Sol.  Not this.  I drink a lot of beer.  I don't often get emotional about it.  Balter turned me into a little girl with a skinned knee.  I had nothing I didn't like, and I can't wait to try the rest.  The food:  We had two dishes from the Shareables section, the Street Tacos with fried fish and the Fried Green Tomatoes.  Both really good.  We wanted to sample more but got too full (probably cos we couldn't stop drinking the beer).  The table next to us got the Caramelized Brussels Sprouts and Fried Chicken Sliders.  They looked suh. GOOD.  Many people were ordering the burgers and Potato Chip Nachos.  There are many things on my list to try.  Please don't change the menu before I get a chance to sample everything!The space:  Edison bulbs abound.  The lighting is low but not annoyingly so like some places.  The bartenders are incredibly friendly and attentive, no easy feat considering how busy this place is.  Subway tile in the toilets with simple steel stalls and hardware mildly reminiscent of an old service station.  I like the minimalist feel, and I think it's necessary for such a small space to be functional.  I was shocked at just how much seating they had.  There are some tables set up family style, which allows for more diners to be seated as well.  Despite the crowd, when we were seated, I didn't feel like I was in anyone's way, which can easily happen in a small space with so many people.  Can't wait to come back.  Thank you for turning a blighted Knoxville corner into a gathering place, Balter.  Cheers!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jaime W.,"Asheville, NC",8/24/2019,4.0,"Good service, decent food. My hubs liked his beer and they made me a tasty virgin cocktail."

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Suzy S.,"Sparta, TN",11/28/2020,5.0,My absolute FAVORITE place to get brunch or dinner in Knoxville!! The service is amazing and the food is always top tier. I've been eating here for about a year now and I have never been dissatisfied! The best server they have is Alec! He makes you feel welcomed from the moment he opens his mouth. I enjoy showing new friends and family this restaurant and I don't plan on stopping!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kathryn C.,"Knoxville, TN",11/20/2020,5.0,I had lunch with a friend here today. Food and service excellent. I had the Fish & Chips and ate every bite. She has the beer cheese soup and a sandwich.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Karson S.,"Austin, TX",1/1/2018,4.0,"Usually great beer is served here with decent ""bar"" food (with a slight twist). They do have $1 mimosas for brunch which is a pretty good deal. The outside patio is cozy and has a fire going in the winter. The seats are nearly all picnic table style benches outside. If you like nachos, get the potato chip nachos and a beer! Cozy place"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kirk W.,"Matthews, NC",9/18/2018,5.0,"First time in Knoxville and I was not disappointed.  This beer is seriously good.  let's not forget the food either.  I had the Jambalaya, it was hearty!!  So delicious, spicy but not killer hot.  Highly recommend stopping by, you will not be disappointed!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Karin B.,"Mobile, AL",4/7/2018,5.0,Omg their Mac and cheese literally made me do a happy dance! And potato chip nachos and fried green tomatoes were so amazingly good!

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Andrew C.,"Fort Sanders, Knoxville, TN",11/15/2020,5.0,"The food was above par. The depth of flavor of the sliders as well as the avocado toast was unique. The setting was enjoyable and the history of the establishment is one of a kind. Jacqueline was incredibly attentive and very personable. As a GM in the hospitality industry, I was thoroughly impressed with how she managed tables while also providing great customer service. I wish we could have more altruistic servers like her in our sector. I would highly recommend anyone to dine here."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Robert G.,"Loudon, TN",9/26/2020,5.0,We had great service and the food was some of the best we have had in Knoxville. Beer was good too. We had people with us from out of state and they said the food was unbelievable. Loved it!  Will definitely go back.

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chandler Z.,"St. Petersburg, FL",9/22/2019,5.0,"We stopped here once on a road trip, had our dog with us and it goes up there as one of my top 5 favorite burgers. My boyfriend shared some of his, I had the tacos which were great, but had nothing on his burger.We were just back in Knoxville and it was great again. The Nitro Tap WAS amberrific, goes down as one of my boyfriends favorite beers ever. This place is also extremely dog friendly, hooked our pup up with ice cold water and a treat. Love this spot! Also really cool set up with their patio and inside bar."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Dan P.,"Lawrenceville, GA",10/6/2019,5.0,"Passed by this place multiple times finally stopped, glad I did, great food great service , cool environment- I had heard great things from friends but pretty picky where I spend my $$$ turned out they were right"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Erin C.,"Powell, TN",8/2/2018,5.0,"This is one of my favorite places to eat! They have wonderful food and a great selection of beers plus the patios just can't be beat. LYou have got to get the nachos and have them add chicken, it is amazing!The restaurant is always super clean, and the bathrooms are as well. It's got a cool five on the inside in a really awesome back deck with games and a fire pit perfect for those cool Tennessee nights."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Andrea R.,"Surfside Beach, SC",12/26/2019,5.0,"Loved the atmosphere of this brewery! Happy hour rocks!  Can't beat $3 beers! Loved the Nachos & Blackened Fish Tacos. My daughter loved her veggie burger, it had great taste! Fluffy bun, added the Tillamook Aged Cheddar & enjoyed every bite!  My son enjoyed the chicken fingers, they are hand breaded & not frozen or store bought. Thank you for being a great ending to our day trip to Knoxville!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,V G.,"Chicago, IL",7/11/2018,5.0,This place has a great ambience and the food is extra tasty tried the fried green tomatoes they were the best I've ever had greatly priced and some good beer flights and you can bring dogs
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kelly M.,"Cincinnati, OH",12/30/2017,5.0,"Wow, what a deal for happy hour! Their food was super tasty and so cheap during happy hour.  We sampled everything on the menu and had 3 rounds of drinks....our bill was $25.  That's impressive.  Nice spot with a great reuse of an old garage.  Close to downtown, easy to walk to, highly recommend."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Emily E.,"Williamsburg, VA",10/13/2019,4.0,"I hope they serve Maypop and Balter's chicken sliders in heaven.Great spot-- love the indoor area, the front patio, and the beer garden!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ezra B.,"Knoxville, TN",10/12/2019,5.0,"The food here is excellent across the board, but I especially love the tacos. I prefer it as a restaurant that also has good beer to a place to drink with friends, because it is usually rather busy. But 5/5 overall, a cool Knoxville staple."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tony T.,"Miami, FL",8/3/2018,5.0,"This place was amazing. As one of the few places open late when we arrived in Knoxville, it really satisfied our hunger after a long road trip. The burger was mouthwatering and the Mac n Cheese was made with creamy, beer-battered cheese, which really stood out to me."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Nika H.,"Atlanta, GA",4/2/2019,5.0,"After a long day of hiking, a group of us decided to look up somewhere open fairly late with good beer and food. We came across Balter Beerworks and boy, were we pleasantly surprised. We were seated about an hour before closing time and our waiter was very personable, funny, and helpful with selecting menu items. I started out with a flight of 4 beers and liked all of them! I tried the ESB, Maypop, Amber, and nitro. The ESB ended up being my favorite of the 4. For dinner, I ordered the blackened fish tacos and they were SO AMAZING. The fish was cooked perfectly and placed inside a soft tortilla with a hard shell tortilla inside, which provided a great texture to bite into. The Pico and sauce that topped it off was the perfect finish. My friends all ordered burgers and they said it was slightly above average. Not the best, but not the worst. Overall, we were all very happy with our experience there and did not feel as though they were rushing us out due to being closer to closing time."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,K C.,"Mililani, HI",4/4/2019,5.0,"BB is a splendid choice for dinner and drinks and the happy hour is top-notch.  The cocktails were perfect and I thoroughly enjoyed the tacos (cod and steak) and sliders (beef and fried chicken), which cost $1.50 each during happy hour. I would be remiss if I wrote this review without mentioning our server, Grace.  She was exceptional!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Robert S.,"Louisville, KY",9/29/2019,3.0,"This place was ok. I went on a week night and it was packed. Had the chicken sliders, they were good, a little dry. Fries were super greasy, unfortunate. Only stayed for one beer, which was the highlight of the meal. Service was ok, as I said they were pretty busy. I sat at the bar and the bartender looked like he could use so help."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Matt D.,"Knoxville, TN",1/14/2020,5.0,This place is awesome! Spectacular bourbon and whiskey selection and you can't beat their 1$ sliders during happy hour. This place is the bomb diggity. Best experience shared with friends :)
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/5/2017,5.0,"Once again, we had a wonderful experience. Today a fly flew into my beer - really no big deal. Our server, Hunter, didn't hesitate to bring me a new Good Neighbor. He's quite awesome!  Next time we're bringing the little locas as dogs are welcome on the patio and beer garden."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",6/25/2017,4.0,"I ordered the Balter Burger well done. I got it with quite a bit of pink, way more than I like but it was not too red at least. I ate it and it was tasty - no additional condiments needed. The house pickles were great. My husband had the black bean burger and I wish I had ordered that. It was awesome!  Our server, Heather the best!  She had the manager come over when we pointed out the meat and they took care of it and gave us a gift card for our next visit. The service absolutely out of the is world!  We will definitely come back, even without the gift card and I recommend this place to anyone in Knoxville. The atmosphere is fun!Awesome service tonight, and the bean burger, fish tacos, and fried green tomatoes were all awesome!  Not much leftover, just a couple of fries."

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Everette P.,"Knoxville, TN",11/9/2019,3.0,"Not a huge fan. If one of my friends asked me to go, I'd go and drink some beers, eat a burger. The beers good just not dying to go again. If your reading this review and thinking about going, go and try it for yourself. I didn't fall in love but you might, it's not a bad place."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Cherie T.,"Knoxville, TN",6/23/2017,4.0,"Had a really great service, the patio/beer garden was really pleasant and the beer was average. Blackened fish tacos were on  happy hour and they were deliciousness"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Craig B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",6/28/2017,3.0,"Love the building. It's what originally caught my eyes. The food was way better than most restaurants and blows away other breweries. The beer, the most important was ok. Nothing amazing, nothing crazy experiment on tap and all pretty hoppy. I'd recommend they experiment and always have at least one crazy brew on rotation. Would be back for the food and atmosphere not so much the beer. So great place to eat for lunch and or meetings."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Dave F.,"Mt Airy, MD",4/30/2019,5.0,"They produce great beer!! And the food is also outstanding !! When I'm in Knoxville, I make it a point to visit."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Elizabeth F.,"Chattanooga, TN",4/6/2019,1.0,Wait time is totally ridiculous!  We arrive at 1:30pm. Waited 30 minutes to be seated. It's now 3:06pm and food is no where near! Sucks big time!  Not coming back for sure!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chris S.,"Winston-Salem, NC",3/16/2020,5.0,Tasty food and good service. Our server Juliana was excellent. The hot chicken salad was delicious. It was an excellent choice as we passed thru Knoxville.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,George L.,"Knoxville, TN",2/11/2018,5.0,"Great food and beer, the burgers are great we use this place a lot for the general surgery interviews for UT very glad the restaurant is capable allowing such a big group to eat there. The chicken sliders are great nachos are good too fried green tomatoes are great as well."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kristen A.,"Knoxville, TN",5/2/2019,5.0,"Good beer. Great brunch. Great $2 double mimosas. Fantastic happy hour. sometimes there is a wait, but you can hang out in the bar and grab a drink and snack while you wait. The patio is also pretty nice. Definitely recommend"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Aris T.,"Redlands, CA",10/29/2019,4.0,Great atmosphere and the best happy hour in town. Well and draft drinks are discounted and the sliders and tacos are good for a cheap price. Their Sunday brunches are great as well. I had the eggs Benedict and it was tasty. Giving it a 4 star because there was a dead bug in our waitress' water pitcher and it got poured into my buddy's water glass. He didn't drink anything the rest of the night. I didn't blame him.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Whitney P.,"San Francisco, CA",6/12/2018,5.0,"My boyfriend and I went for brunch on a Saturday with some friends and absolutely loved it! The mimosas are fabulous (and only $1 for a single, $2 for a double, or $7 for a carafe!). I ordered the chicken and waffles, which I give 5 full stars. Highly recommend! We did make reservations the night before to ensure that we got a table, however, the wait seemed minimal when we arrived."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Cayla A.,"Fort Worth, TX",4/18/2019,3.0,Hate the wait here even when you have a reservation there is a good wait. The food isn't nearly as good as I though it would be especially for the prices.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Grant M.,"Kodak, TN",7/22/2019,4.0,Tasty American Food - tough to get parking and seating because it's so popular. I would recommend ordering the chicken sliders!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Emily A.,"Knoxville, TN",4/27/2018,4.0,I recently took my boyfriend there for the first time for dinner. We shared the fried green tomatoes and they were perfectly crunchy and delicious! The burrito bowl was equally stellar. My only complaint would be that it can be noisy when the restaurant is full which makes hearing each other a little difficult. Cool place for a beer and dinner!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Half N.,"Las Vegas, NV",8/21/2019,5.0,"Awesome place, friendly, good beer! I had the 4oz Balter burger with Mac n cheese... best I've ever had! Get the Mac n cheese, it's the best I've ever had anywhere in the USA!!!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Josh W.,"Maryville, TN",10/19/2019,5.0,"Been several times and this place is always consistent with the food and brews! Bartender was super attentive, hot chicken sliders were on point! Not too expensive either. Beer garden is excellent place to meet friends and hang out. Anytime you're visiting Knoxville or you happen to be downtown, this is a solid place to go!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Luke H.,"Kingsport, TN",10/13/2019,5.0,Good food and great alcohol selections.  I had the wings the only time I've been and they were insanely hot.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Cassie S.,"Amherst, MA",10/6/2018,5.0,"So good!! The food was delicious, parking wasn't a problem, the service and ambience were great, and the beer was good. What more could you want? We will definitely come back when we return to Knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Valerie L.,"Knoxville, TN",3/13/2016,5.0,"Great first time experience! Fun, funky atmosphere, and great food. The menu had so many interesting options. The shrimp and grits were great. I drooled over the big plates of home made fries as they passed by. I will partake of the blackened tacos and the maple infused Brussels sprouts topped with a fried egg on my next visit!! Duncan was a great waiter and was super helpful and patient when I couldn't make up my mind. He provided his favorites and made helpful suggestions based on my likes. He had a very good knowledge of their beers helping to make the perfect selection."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Brittany B.,"Augusta, GA",12/4/2018,5.0,"I am so sad we found out about this place a week before I was done with my five week training. I have a feeling we would have been here WAY more often had we known. In the past week, there were some in my group who came here two to three times. The happy hour is unbeatable and the food, especially for the value, is amazing. The one time I did go, I tried the fish tacos, a beef slider and a hot chicken slider. The fish tacos were my absolute favorite and I wanted to bring my husband back here but we just didn't get the chance before leaving town. The beer specials were also great. $3 beers and add $2 if you wanted a Balter Beerworks glass. I can see why they get as busy as they do because service was great and food was excellent. If the weather were warmer, I could see their outside being an awesome place to relax and have a flight of beer. I am going to compile a list of places for people who are traveling to Knoxville to definitely hit at some point throughout their trip and this place will be on there!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jerry W.,"Ringgold, GA",7/21/2020,5.0,Food and service was good. Would definitely go back. Their chips and salsa appetizer was great.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Mark S.,"Louisville, TN",7/21/2019,4.0,One of my favorite places .... however. Waited over an hour for our food st a Sunday brunch. Staff was overwhelmed
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bailey W.,"Nashville, TN",1/14/2018,5.0,"RUN, don't walk here for the nachos! I was skeptical of nachos on potato chips but they were amazing! Be sure to add bacon. We devoured these and not a crumb of topping was left on the plate! Followed the appetizer with a black bean burger. Super yummy and the chipotle mayo was a nice addition. The sweet potato waffle fries were crunchy and the perfect side kick to my burger. Can't wait to visit again when I'm back in Knoxville!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Beth G.,"Cookeville, TN",3/20/2017,5.0,Best beer cheese soup ever!!!! I could drink this stuff.  Perfect taste of light cheese with intermittent notes of a sweet burst occasionally of something similar to teriyaki???? Perfect consistency true comfort!!!!!  Great fried green tomatoes with a sweet relish jelly on top.  Great atmosphere and good prices.  Didn't drink but it was a. Tweety and had a bar for cocktails if desired.  Will be back again.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Nancy H.,"Sevierville, TN",6/18/2017,4.0,Slow service maybe because it was Father's Day.  Bar service was terrible.  Food was tasty . Food was nice and cold bar was very tasty.  Cole slaw was very good!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Todd-Layla F.,"Bristol, VA",1/7/2018,5.0,Really enjoyed this place. Great atmosphere and had two TVs in the bar area to watch the game (see photo).  Great craft beer and unique menu items. The brussel sprouts were very good! Highly recommend.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Carlisia G.,"Knoxville, TN",8/27/2019,1.0,"Went in there tonight to have a drink and food after work.. sat out there for almost 10 mins as we watched all the servers and host stand at the host stand talking and laughing while no one greeted us, we ended up leaving."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lily F.,"Hialeah, FL",9/28/2017,2.0,"I came here because I live in the Old City, thus Balter is super close to where i live, and I wanted to check some places off on the Knoxville Ale Trail.  I found parking in their tiny lot and found a spot at the bar, or counter, or 6 seater top area, whatever it's called.  The bar for this brewery is so very small and limited. Its more of a restaurant than brewery.  Lots of booths a high community tables.  I ordered a beer but I cant tell you I remember what it was. Obviously not memorable.  We did order their fish tacos which were tasty and fresh.  I don't id be back though. I was not impressed with the beers or atmosphere."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Greg M.,"Charlotte, NC",6/17/2019,4.0,"This is a good restaurant located within a tasty brewery. In Knoxille you usually have too choose your top priority, good beer or tasty brews. Balter does a nice job delivering on both. Keep it up."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,paul s.,"Knoxville, TN",2/4/2017,5.0,The two of went there around 2:00PM on Saturday.  Very busy but service was quick and our server was very good.  Great beer selection and the menu was good.  I got the fish and breakfast potatoes and Roz got Blackened taco with beans and rice.  Brunch cold salad bar was tasty.  The breakfast potatoes were the best I have ever had.  Potatoes were crispy and just the right amount of peppers and onions.  Two outdoor sections are available and both are dog friendly.A side not as this use to be a BP service station and I rented parking spaces there for several years for my office.The place must be consistent because the folks all seemed to be people that returned.  Lotsa seating but the place was full.  Lotsa parking but all spaces were full.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Melanie T.,"Knoxville, TN",2/27/2016,5.0,"First, the beer... Oh the delicious beer! The Bear Blend (coffer oatmeal porter) made my day. Its not super heavy but amazingly smooth and delicious! 8-6-Rye is a great Brown. And the kolsch was so smooth. The food was equally as amazing as the craft brews. The pimento cheese is extremely flavorful and the tarragon aioli on the sirloin and frites was my favorite part of the meal. This place is great for a few beers on the patio or a laid back date night. :) I will definitely be coming back again and again."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Abby K.,"Denver, CO",7/30/2017,4.0,"They have a great coffee oatmeal porter and their beer cheese soup is delicious. I wish they offered it in a bigger size, lol. Their grilled chicken sandwich was pretty good too."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Court N.,"Lexington, KY",7/24/2019,4.0,"Good food and drinks. The Moscow Mule is by far the best, it tastes like the ginger beer really makes it. The only downside is the parking or lack there of. Recommend ubering if possible. Great service as well!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Laura P.,"Knoxville, TN",9/8/2019,5.0,"We LOVE Balter for so many reasons. Happy Hour is the best in town - $1.50 sliders and tacos, $2 off a pint. We visit pretty often since happy hour extends to 6:30 each weeknight. I highly recommend the Balter Society membership if you visit more than 2 times - it's a $20 lifetime membership that gets you 4 extra oz. in each beer pour (even at happy hour! So that's a 20 oz pour for $3/4!) and a skip to the top of the line if it's crowded. We enjoy sitting outside since the patio is pup friendly. Highly recommend."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Clark G.,"Washington, DC",12/19/2016,5.0,"Outstanding place to eat and have a quality beer. I've been meaning to come here for a while and I finally had the chance to stop in for lunch. My wife and I split the potato chip nachos, which were delicious. I had the Grilled cheese and tomato basil soup. Sandwich was perfect but the soup was the star! Rich and creamy with a spice I couldn't put my finger on. My wife got the blackened fish tacos. She said they had the best flavor of any fish tacos she had tasted. On top of that, their beer is fantastic. My wife is a Blue Moon type of girl, but she loved the Good Neighbor. I had a flight of four beers. Fantastic!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,K C.,"Peoria, AZ",5/9/2018,5.0,"Great beer, great bartenders, great food. Visiting from Arizona for work. Ended up sitting at the bar here and I could not be happier. Stop here and have food and drink if in Knoxville. You will not regret."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,madison s.,"Pelican, Cape Coral, FL",7/5/2020,5.0,This brewery was amazing had amazing drinks and salads and veggie burgers! go here!!!!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Daniel T.,"Bryant, AR",6/29/2020,5.0,"It was the top rated restaurant in the downtown area, so we gave it a try.  It's easy to see why it is top!  We will definitely go again."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,EllieMae C.,"Lenoir City, TN",12/9/2017,5.0,"This is our third time here and once again exceeded expectations.  We did 3 different appetizers and drinks and everything was fantastic. This is our new ""go to"" spot when visiting downtown.  Service was spot on."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lauren F.,"Knoxville, TN",8/9/2019,5.0,"Balter beer works at my favorite restaurant of all time! We try to come here at least once a week. I have the best happy hour around town, and an incredible friend! The brunch bar with goodies like pasta salad, fruit, and fresh baked good it's not to be missed. Seasonal beers make this place a wonderful place to take new visitors to Knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Gretchen R.,"Needham, IN",12/7/2016,5.0,"I need more Balters in my life. Can we get a hand clap for that happy hour? Cheap drinks + food? Balter, if you were a man, you'd have my heart! Can't get enough of the Yeehaw brew and so glad they have it on tap. Also chicken biscuit sandwich thingys (great description right?) are so good. I'd like them to come in groups of 20. If you're like me and enjoy a good Mike, look no further. Balters has THE BEST. Like...top three Moscow mules in my life. This is not a joke people...go here."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Brian A.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/13/2019,4.0,Pretty good food and beer. Easy go to. Happy hour is super solid. Parking is hard to find even with all the annex lots
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Laura S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/4/2017,5.0,"Went for lunch with my mom on July 4th. Pretty crowded even at 2:45 pm, but we got seated quickly! I had the black bean burger with sweet potato fries and she had the Jackson Ave. Salad. Both were excellent. Possibly the best black bean burger I've ever had. Excellent service too. Definitely will be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Christina B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/27/2016,4.0,"So happy to finally Have Balter Beerworks in the old BP space.  As a lover and beer, this place is able to satisfy my needs with great results.  They brew their own beer, and also have other craft beer on tap besides theirs.  Thank you!  Sometimes i'm craving something light, and since the  good neighbor isn't one of my favorites or anything too hoppy for that matter, I am able to try one of the rotating drafts.  The food is great including Brunch ($1 mimosas)  and happy hour (M-F 3 to 6:30). Happy hour is one of the best with:$3 draft beer$1.50 tacos and sliders$3 chips and queso$4 pimento and hummus plateOne of my favorite meals is the many options for fish tacos!  The only complaint here is that  the option is only soft flour and hard corn.  As a lover of soft corn tortillas it is a diabolical to not have this option.  Please Please consider an authentic option for us corn tortilla  lovers.  The best part of Balter is the large outside seating that includes a patio and beer garden with hanging lights (awwwww).Besides my Tortilla meltdown, everything here is delicious, including dessert!  Parking is a hassle at busy times, as there are only a handful of spaces in front of the restaurant, but you can park on the street and the lot across from Sweet P's."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,David C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/1/2016,4.0,"Great place and good location.  Very cool, industrial, bright, open space with various seating types.  Also a great, very expansive patio.  The beer selection is pretty good, but certainly could be better.  The food is actually fantastic and even more of a reason to come.  The menu is unique and very well prepared.  Don't just come here for a beer.  Eat!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Becky B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2017,4.0,"Call ahead for reservations on the weekend! Cozy place and cute outside patio with hanging lights and a fire pit to stay warn if its chilly outside. They make their own beer, burgers are good, I love their nachos."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Nicole M.,"Concord, NC",3/8/2018,5.0,Nice quaint bar with great beer selection but the best happy hour ever!!! Great service and food was delicious as well. Nothing I ate was bad every time I returned it was same great food and service!!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Alan S.,"Knoxville, TN",8/1/2019,3.0,A ok food. Meh on the beer. Let me explain. This is a Beerworks place emphasis on Beer. I took a friend there for a late lunch and I was excited about this place because I have visited before and wanted to share my experience. We  started with a few 10 oz beers and some fries. Beer arrives and it is room temperature I was embarrassed at that point and I put ice in our beer from our water glasses! We go ahead and drink the beer I just didn't want to complain but when we order a second round we change brands and mention it to our server and she says ya I noticed your beers were warm!!!!Why serve them to us and charge us for them!The business thing to do is at least comp you the next round or something.The Tacos we ordered were alright $13 dollars two tacos rice and beans. Tacos lacked fish and was mostly filler products lettuce etc.I like this place and will continue to visit but I hope a place that specializes in Beer can serve cold beer.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Elizabeth M.,"Urbanna, VA",12/5/2019,2.0,"We called and made a reservation (as the website suggested); however, when we got to the restaurant- our table had been given to a group of walk-ins. When I inquired about this I was dryly explained that the group of walk-ins had been waiting a while. If you aren't going to honor reservations then don't offer them. We waited 20+ minutes for the table we initially reserved. I get it, it was probably an honest mistake/misunderstanding but it could've been handled a bit better. We had 2 children who needed high chairs (it was pretty obvious by the age of the children) - we were seated in a spot that was not accommodating for high chairs so we where told we couldn't use them because of a ""fire safety hazard"" that they would be blocking a walkway. Again, I get that, but WHY SEAT US THERE WITH CHILDREN only to tell us you can give us high chairs to use because of the table you placed us at. The beer was good, the food was decent enough, the atmosphere was cool, but the service was  meh. One tome here was enough for me -- we won't be returning."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sydney F.,"Nashville, TN",7/21/2019,5.0,Food and drinks are the best! Service is sometimes slow but that's usually because they're slammed!! Great spot for locals.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Amanda A.,"Belvidere, IL",7/27/2020,3.0,"I'm so glad the bar is able to operate during COVID. They serve my favorite cocktails, so to get them delivered was a real treat. Sadly, the delivery didn't go as planned--a few spilled-- but I understand they are using a third party service right now"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Casey B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/2/2019,5.0,This is probably my favorite brunch spot in Knoxville. I love the avocado toast and the happy hour mimosas are awesome!! They have a house made hot sauce that's really good too. Also dog friendly which is always a plus for me!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Abigail W.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",2/23/2019,4.0,"I was very surprised to find that this does not have a bar atmosphere given their name! It has a very trendy, industrial vibe and the food matches. I ordered a bowl with barley, shrimp, and veggies and it was very good! The portions here are very large, some even large enough for two! The Mac and cheese is a must-try!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Richard L.,"Knoxville, TN",7/14/2019,5.0,"Great beer, really good food (although only had an appetizer), and polite and attentive staff who seem happy to be working there!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Shannan R.,"Fresno, CA",5/25/2017,5.0,"Went here on Wednesday night which is buy a pint and keep the glass night! The venue is trendy with garage window style walls. Although it's a brewery, they also have a full bar and offer white and red wines. Average/ expected prices. Nothing lower then $7 for a drink. Food was amazing. I had the fried chicken. I know that sounds like I got the most basic thing on the menu but the batter is fresh and the chicken is fresh. My friends got the chicken sandwich and the size of the chicken breast was huge! It did not disappoint. My other friend got the blacken mahi fish tacos. He loved the tacos!! Last, but not least, we got the skillet cookies. The cookie was served very hot and with ice cream on top. This was probably the less of the experience at balter. I wish the cookie was more ooie goose and not as cooked. I totally recommend this place though!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Joseph K.,"Harleyville, SC",12/2/2018,5.0,"Balter is one of my favorite restaurants in Knoxville. Not only is their food excellent across the board, every beer they brew is incredible. We go once a week."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Greg M.,"Greenville, SC",5/17/2019,5.0,"Great appetizers and entrees, very good beer made on site. Weve hit it before and after concerts at the Concourse and during Big Ears, when it's usually less crowded than the restaurants on the venue circuit."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sally J.,"Knoxville, TN",2/10/2019,5.0,Service was great-sat in the bar area. Food was delicious as always. This place is a definite if you want a good beer and good grub.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Amy S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/6/2016,4.0,"Great food! Great atmosphere! I got the Brussels, fish tacos (not pictured) and Mac n cheese. The first two were AWESOME. Mac was average."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chris B.,"Knoxville, TN",3/9/2020,1.0,"Had a dreadful experience here tonight (9 Mar 20). Waited for almost an hour for a table. Took over 10 minutes to place drink order. Took another 15 minutes to place food order. Took about 30 minutes for food to come out. Food quality was abysmal. Side items were inedible. My fried fish entree was served at room temperature. Just a very, very bad experience overall. Server was nice though."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Heather V.,"Knoxville, TN",11/26/2018,5.0,"This place has amazing burgers. The burger itself has great flavor. Can get an upgrade to local beef if you like. Salad dressings are delicious. So are the flavored sauces and mayo. Mmmm. Everything tastes like it's made in house because it is. In the Summer there's outdoor seating, which is great. Inside atmosphere is fabulous too. There's a cool beer garden if you want to hang out and drink. Service has always been great for us. Friendly servers. Prompt service. Definitely recommend this place. Personally, not a beer drinker, but love their food!!!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,John R.,"Delaware, OH",5/15/2016,4.0,"We were driving through Knoxville and ended up doing a small brewery tour. This was our last of three tours. The beer here was good and very solid. They could have had a little more variety and flavor but a good solid base. The food was outstanding. I highly recommend starting off with the taco shareable and then the shrimp and grits. Staff was super. They were friendly and attentive. As far as environment there is about anything you want. They have a beer garden, inside restaurant style, bar or just outside seating. Serious, what more could you want?"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Alex B.,"Knoxville, TN",3/9/2018,5.0,Really upset they changed the hot chicken from dry to wet. Tastes much worse please change it back
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Alex B.,"Knoxville, TN",2/2/2018,5.0,Wow. What can I say about this place. The most amazing burgers best beer and excellent service. I love it and I'll spread my ashes here 100/100
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Savannah C.,"Old North Knoxville, Knoxville, TN",6/5/2019,5.0,Super great place to hang! Superb patio seating! Wonderful cocktails. My favorite is the cranberry mule! Laura is a wonderful bartender! The staff is so awesome and attentive! Such a cute and pleasant hangout! The food is so so good! The salmon salad and grilled chicken sandwich are so yummy
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Xerxes N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4/19/2016,4.0,"Let me get to what's important. If you know me, I'm really not a fan of craft beer. All the hops and barley and all the other talk does nothing for me. I cringe at the thought of drinking most craft beers. Cue in Balter Beerworks. I arrived there straight from the airport. A 45 minute flight was delayed by four hours so I obviously needed a drink. I requested a light beer and John, our waiter, suggested the kolsch, labeled on the menu, Good Neighbor. It was refreshing, light, and with a simple taste to make my long day of traveling not that far to begin with go much better.Throw in that I had a chicken taco and a fish taco on the outdoor patio on a gorgeous spring evening and I was happy to get to my hotel and relax for the evening."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chris A.,"Knoxville, TN",6/2/2016,2.0,"It was lacking. The food was ok. I suppose I've just aged out of the group of folks who would serendipitously rave about the 'atmosphere' and whatnot. There isn't anything overly special about it. Serving staff was uncaring and distracted by their own interactions with each other. Food was warm, not hot. Beer was OK. All in all, not what I'd hoped. I was excited to try it and was let down."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Keyli H.,"Waynesville, NC",4/24/2017,5.0,"So delicious!!!! Prices are great, even for a family. All of their food is amazing. I had the street tacos appetizer as a meal and they were everything and more, with pickled veges in the side. Both the fries and chips are great as well. They are both made from scratch in house. Others I went with had burgers and for us, one very key factor is the bun. It too was great, made right there in house. It think is was a sourdough bun."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Katie S.,"Oak Ridge, TN",3/22/2016,3.0,"This place was super busy and loud with subpar service and average food. I was there two times in one night and had the same experience both times. The bartenders did make a great Manhattan. I ordered the Mediterranean salad with salmon. The salmon was an adequate amount, but had no flavor to speak of. The salad had plenty of green olives- which I love! - but more dressing than I would have liked. My husband had the fried shrimp plate. The shrimp and fries were ok, the hush puppies were very dry.This was a place that drew a crowd for sure, as its a new downtown brewery. If you are looking for a pub crawl in Knoxville, try it out. But if you are looking for a nice dinner, there are better places to eat downtown."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tim C.,"Knoxville, TN",11/14/2018,5.0,Very good food.  Very good beer.  Very cool location and buildout.  Great outdoor area.  Parking is suspect.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Taylor D.,"Knoxville, TN",1/6/2019,1.0,"Wait time is not accurate at all. Lists a wait time of 0 min, showed up and it is a 30 min wait. Very disappointed."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jay C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/9/2016,5.0,Enjoyed the Fish n' Chips lunch special. Excellent French fries. Really cool atmosphere with complete renovation and Restoration Hardware feel. We even got a nice parking spot. Happy to go back soon!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Megan F.,"Charlotte, NC",10/4/2016,4.0,Good ale! Nice location and bar. Only had drinks this time but awesome service & clean bathrooms.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Aaron H.,"Lebanon, OH",10/1/2016,5.0,"I don't often give five-stars, but tonight's experience rally couldn't be improved on.  We had a large party, and it was during a Tennessee football game, but we decided to give it a shot...  Turns out, we were in luck.  Our server, Hannah, was simply adorable - she was attentive, and made us feel completely welcome throughout the entire meal.  We ordered the potato chip nachos and the caramelized brussels sprouts for appetizers.  The potato chip nachos were packed full of flavor, and could have been ordered as a complete meal.  The brussels sprouts were unique, they tasted like pancakes in a way, but certainly enjoyable.  We tried the Balter Burger with Mac & Cheese - oh my goodness.  The Mac & Cheese was a gourmet mac & cheese.. Hints of garlic & onion throughout - absolutely top-notch.  The hamburger was one of the most flavorful patties of beef I've enjoyed in a long time.  Hannah recommended the shrimp & grits to my wife, and even though she wanted to, the serving was so big she couldn't finish it.  Everything was so well-seasoned and fresh, it was hard to stop eating.Hannah also recommended the seasonal brew, and it was immediately one of my favorites.  Love at first sip.  The Oktoberfest brew had all the flavor of a craft beer, but didn't finish with the IPA bite I don't care for.  Absolutely one of the best beers I've tasted.So, my thanks to our wonderful Hannah, my hats off to the chef, and a glass raised to the beer master.DEFINITELY recommended to friends & family!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Duyen M.,"Knoxville, TN",8/2/2018,4.0,"This place is really good. The burgers are well seasoned, and they cooked my burger exactly how I wanted. My daughter ordered mac n' cheese, and it was not her favorite. She is a picky eater, and the mac n' cheese had onions and green onions ( I think that's what it was.) She did not really like the extra stuff in it, as she likes the classic noodles and cheese. I thought it was quite good though. Whenever my family and I are in downtown we want to stop here to eat."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sarah Jane G.,"Asheville, NC",3/27/2016,5.0,"This was by far, my favorite joint in Knoxville!I know it is only a month old but, they have done a fantastic job with their beer and their menu. I tried their Firebelly IPA and their Gail's Pale Ale which were both delicious but very similar. It seems as though they are only brewing 5 or 6 beers, one pilsner, one pale ale, one IPA, etc., So, as they advance I would love to see them move forward into some seasonals and rotating taps! The food was great! I have no complaints and neither did the 3 others who I went with. We had appetizers of the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Potato Chip Nachos. The tomatoes were a little too bready for my taste but the sauce was good and overall, they passed the test. The nachos were, for lack of a better word, BALLIN'! Covered with all of the fresh toppings and cheese with queso for dipping! I ordered the Mediterranean Salad which was massive and super yummy with all fresh ingredients. The 3 others ordered a burger, tacos, and shrimp & grits which were all tasty! They have a large menu with something for everyone from bar style food to nicer entrees. The prices were also great for the amount of food we received. I was extremely pleased with their service. We were seated immediately outside under an umbrella and our waitress was very sweet and patient. Our friends brought their 10-month-old baby and our server was great with her! They asked the parents if there was anything they could provide to keep the baby and the parents happy. Two major thumbs up to this accommodating waitress!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Hannah M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/5/2018,5.0,This is one of my favorite places in Knoxville. The beer is good and the atmosphere is fun. Brunch is  Saturday and Sunday and lasts until 3pm. Balter makes the best Bloody Mary in town in my opinion. Also the fish tacos and fried green tomato Benedict are amazing! Or try potato chip nachos.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Cliff C.,"Louisville, TN",2/8/2016,4.0,Opening day here. Stopped by for a taste of their brews. The Bear....very nice coffee flavour. Very nice atmosphere. Renovated gas station in a very cool theme. They also serve food. Bound to be a hit!!!!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Otaku G.,"New Tazewell, TN",2/10/2020,5.0,Holy shit this place is good I recommend the breakfast bowl also in the patio area there is these igloo things you can sit in and eat and they have heaters in it! I'm too young to have the beer though.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Noel D.,"Knoxville, TN",10/14/2018,5.0,"The best brunch option around. I come here on a weekly basis and it's become one of the highlights of my week. The food is excellent, the environment is great, and the service is exceptional! They have inexpensive mimosas during brunch time and I highly recommend this as a must-try!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michelle C.,"Joliet, IL",6/5/2016,5.0,"This place is a MUST! Google maps gave us the parking lot upstairs and the GM, Mark asked for our keys to bring our car down to the front door. That alone should make this a great place, but the food was absolutely amazing. Service and beer was great!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jill F.,"Melbourne, FL",11/30/2018,5.0,"Amazing food!! Attentive, friendly and fun service...we have found a new favorite place!! I had the ""Spicy Meatloaf"". As the server told us, more sweet than spicy (which I LOVE), and served atop thin jalapeño cornbread with green beans. Awesome!! Oh, and you have to try the Fried Mac 'n Cheese Balls. You will NOT be disappointed!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Erin D.,"Knoxville, TN",4/19/2016,4.0,Third times a charm. Great spot in our neighborhood. The menu has something for everyone and they are good about food allergies. The choice of beer is great... Im a HUGE fan of the Bear Blend. The atmosphere is great inside AND out. Big groups can actually be accommodated.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sarah L.,"Munich, Germany",11/23/2019,5.0,"Awesome brews, awesome food, and awesome staff. Kolton waited on us outside and handled all us crazy customers fighting for the warmer igloos with grace and class. Big props to somehow keeping everyone happy, the effort was definitely noticed. I definitely recommend and I'll definitely be back any time I'm driving through Knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Daniel B.,"Lexington, KY",8/6/2018,4.0,"Overall this is a pretty good place. The beer that I had was very tasty. The food was ok. I had the burrito bowl and it did the job, but nothing too special. The nacho chips were amazing and that will be the thing to keep me coming back. Excited to try some of the other beers."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sam R.,"Greater Heights, Houston, TX",1/16/2019,4.0,"Started out w a HH fish taco, then Jambalaya and a beer... tasty and filling! Great atmosphere although mostly couples at the time i visited."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,D R.,"Knoxville, TN",4/10/2016,5.0,This place is banging. Great food! Great service. Quality beer. I wish the side choices were on the brunch menu. A few pieces of my rice weren't cooked all the way but the tacos were so well seasoned. Idk how they cook their potatoes but omg! Black bean Benedict was excellent w/ side of avocado. Mark was a very handsome and friendly manager!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Judy E.,"Knoxville, TN",3/15/2016,4.0,"First off I would love to give this place a 5 Star rating but.... It being a brewery, we were disappointed to find out they only had 1 beer on tap for the night. :-( I was really looking forward to trying out there beer. Now on to the food! EXCELLENT!! We had the potato chip nachos, fish tacos and chicken sliders. Everything was wonderful! Can't wait to go back and hopefully they will have more beer on tap."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Julie K.,"Franklin, TN",10/3/2016,5.0,"LOVED Balter Beerworks!  I am truly sad that we do not have Balter Beerworks in Nashville because I would be there all the time.  I was very hungry and tried the Grilled Pimento Cheese sandwich on my server's advice.  (Mind you - I have never ever had a grilled pimento sandwich).  It was amazing!  I ate every single crumb and it was a HUGE sandwich.  My 16 year old son got the chicken tenders and he loved them so much he would not even give me a bite.  (I was miffed since they looked really good.)  He is quite a snob about chicken tenders and he ranked them among the best he has ever had.  Take that for what it's worth.  Hubby and I both enjoyed our beers.  Mine was not too hoppy and served very cold which are both very important to me.  Overall, we had great service in a very pleasant atmosphere and we all loved our food.  I know we will be back whenever in Knoxville.  I really wish they would come to Nashville!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Karen B.,"Las Vegas, NV",7/15/2018,5.0,"My husband and I stopped in to have a beer and an appetizer.  We tried a beer flight to get an idea of their drafts.  Pretty tasty, and a good way to find your favorite.  Food and service was good.  I liked their decor.  Parking was a challenge, but we found a spot across the street where we wouldn't get towed.  All in all a good experience and we will be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ryan W.,"Knoxville, TN",4/25/2016,4.0,"Can't speak for the beer, but the atmosphere and food are very good! I ordered their potato chips with queso and chicken fingers for apps to split with friends. The chips and queso were awesome; only drawback was the chicken tenders were only three pieces and small, but if they are an additional app to split, that's perfect for most. My entree was fish and chips. The fish was done perfectly and I enjoyed the flavor of the fries! Now, the real kicker was the dessert. Holy #%^*, was that amazing. A chocolate chip cookie done in a cast iron skillet, topped with a single scoop of  vanilla bean ice cream, and I obviously asked for a glass of milk, which Balter came in the clutch and delivered. Again, overall I definitely recommend checking this place out!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Margo S.,"Westminster, MD",5/9/2017,5.0,LOTS of Beer! Great atmosphere! Great Service! If we were closer then Baltimore MD we would come back for sure ! Good food! Chicken Sliders tasted great. Grilled Avocado chicken was yummy. Black Eyed pea salad was very fresh and tasty. Hand cut fries good flavor. Loved the home made hummus and pimento cheese dip with pita and Pickled veggies. Awesome place to hang and chat with friends and drink some beer outside in the beer garden !
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Trinity E.,"Knoxville, TN",6/13/2016,5.0,"The food is amazing! Great selection and something for everyone. The atmosphere is nice. Parking is the only issue, but I don't mind the walk."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kenzie M.,"Shelbyville, TN",1/4/2020,5.0,The fish tacos were absolutely amazing! We loved it all. Margaritas were fantastic too!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Saraya L.,"Knoxville, TN",1/4/2020,5.0,The best brunch and happy hour in Knoxville! We love the unique menu items and beer selection. Definitely one of our favorite spots in town.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,D T.,"Boca Raton, FL",7/12/2018,5.0,Seriously good food here...and great beer!!  The fried green tomatoes with all the trimmings were outstanding!  The service was awesome and so friendly.  The fish n chips and sweet potato fries amazing!  Nevermind the fabulous skillet brownie and choc chip cookie!!  Definitely a must go!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michael M.,"Chattanooga, TN",7/31/2018,5.0,"There's bike stands outside and the service here is welcoming and inviting. The menu offers a variety of bar foods such as tacos, hamburgers, and salads. I had the beer battered fish tacos which were decent. The rice and beans they came with were great."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Greg M.,"Knoxville, TN",2/19/2016,5.0,"Went for lunch on a Thursday and sat at the bar. They have 9 types of beer, all made in-house. I got the Jackson Abbey beer -- smooth and flavorful. My lunch was the grilled chicken sandwich with fries. Very tasty and moist. Excellent. The fries are pretty good too. It took a while for the sandwich to come out, but was worth the wait. The decor is casual and cool. One long wall is all windows."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sandra H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/6/2016,5.0,"Great spot to snag some lovely food and tasty bevs. Got there just after the weekday lunch crowd and were seated immediately--and immediately ordered a cab, a Harbitini (not too sweet) and an ice cold Moscow mule (heavy on the ice). Blackened fish tacos (cod, I think), burrito bowl and beer cheese soup rounded out the meal and the bellies. Server Chris was uber helpful on food and drink selections (yeah--it's a brewery but the signature cocktails were the order of the day). Much better than my 1st experience there several months ago--I will be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Charita B.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",4/12/2018,5.0,"Love the food here and the pet-friendly patio. Chicken sliders with house-made pickles are always fabulous. I suppose there is good beer, too"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Hannah G.,"Knoxville, TN",2/14/2020,2.0,"Great Sunday brunch - we've decided that's really the only day we'll go to put up with the line and service. We've actually only had good service on Sundays... Every other time we have went its like we were totally forgotten. So bad that we had literally no where else to be that day but my boyfriend had to get up and go ask another server to bring us our check because our server had disappeared for the longest time (we were outside). Something else that really irked me was whenever we sit outside, they have these drainage holes and the man busing the table was literally just throwing all of the drinks down the drain - straw and all. I said something to him and he laughed and let me know they were biodegradable straws which made me feel better but everytime he would carelessly empty a glass - it would splash everywhere which was just annoying at the lack of thought for the others around him."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kelly K.,"Mokena, IL",6/22/2018,5.0,"This place was great!! We stopped in at the end of our night out because they were still serving food, and our only regret was that we didn't come here first. We enjoyed the chips and shared the street tacos (2 fish and 2 steak) with our beers. Everything we had was delicious, but what really made the visit was our server.  She was so, so sweet and welcoming, and we really enjoyed chatting with her when she checked on us. We would definitely come back here if we get back to Knoxville!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Melody J.,"Maryville, TN",10/13/2018,5.0,"Unpredictably exquisite! Wow, the beer is fantastically peerless and abundant in options. The food is simply transcendent and complementing a particularly alluring environment. See ya again soon!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kelly M.,"Cincinnati, OH",12/30/2017,5.0,"Wow, what a deal for happy hour! Their food was super tasty and so cheap during happy hour.  We sampled everything on the menu and had 3 rounds of drinks....our bill was $25.  That's impressive.  Nice spot with a great reuse of an old garage.  Close to downtown, easy to walk to, highly recommend."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Carlos H.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",12/21/2017,3.0,"This is my first time eating here. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any beers. I did however get some food. I ordered the (funny name for cheese) Tillamooka Burger, if you asked what it meant, it was the name of the cheese on it. It was a mediocre burger, only served medium-medium well done. Not too disappointed about the way it was cooked, I wasn't expecting a high quality piece of meat but still, the burger was just ""ok"". My significant other ordered the Club, and sorta felt the same way. The mention of Chipotle Mayo intrigued her, and was barely noticed. The sweet potato fries I ordered were great for being waffle fries, which let's face it, always makes fries awesome but, weren't really sweet at all. Not to say it was a horrible experience but definitely not worth $30. The service was great, everyone was very inviting, the vibe in there was loud and chill, and I bet there were just better things on the menu to order but it just wasn't their night, tonight. Overpriced and painfully average food."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Vanessa G.,"Santa Ana, CA",12/20/2017,3.0,Food was average. I had the chicken fingers and my friend had the fish and chips nothing special about any of it. Price wasn't worth for how much food we got. Our waitress Laura or Lauren was super friendly and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jessica S.,"TN, TN",12/20/2017,5.0,"My favorite place in Knoxville. I love to go here for dates or to bring family or friends from out of town or just to hang out. Beer 10/10. Consistent and excellent. The bear blend (coffee oatmeal stout) is one of the best coffee brews I've ever had. So smooth, I love it more than the famed ""gotta get up to get down"" brew from the wiseacre brewery in Memphis. Love their seasonal brews and guest brews so far as well. If not for the calories I would get a flight every time I came here.Food 10/10. My significant other loves their veggie burger. We each vouch for the street tacos. The chicken sliders are a guilty pleasure of mine. The fun little pickled garnish on the appetizer plates is something I really enjoy- either pickled cauliflower, carrot or garlic usually. Right now we are in love with their salads, got the jackson avenue salad last time which is SO GENEROUS with the greens, lovely house made vinaigrette is not overpowering, pecans and bleu cheese are perfect with grilled chicken for your protein. I could get it every time."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,EllieMae C.,"Lenoir City, TN",12/9/2017,5.0,"This is our third time here and once again exceeded expectations.  We did 3 different appetizers and drinks and everything was fantastic. This is our new ""go to"" spot when visiting downtown.  Service was spot on."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",12/6/2017,3.0,"Came here on a Thursday night. It wasn't so busy, so you would think the service would be on point. Sadly, what I got here was a little disappointing. I love the beer that they have and I want to say this place is a solid 4 for beer.What I got today was ""The Beast"" burger. But for a $14.99 burger...it was a little pathetic. You would think for a $15 burger it would be big, loaded to the max, right? Nope. And let's just say, if you're on a low carb diet... Balter fails, I mean fails at lettuce wraps. Its not a big problem and can be easily fix, yet they probably won't.Why do I say they fail at lettuce wraps? I mean look at it! They just literally put two leaves on it. THIS IS NOT HOW A LETTUCE WRAP SHOULD BE. I know, I'm a little weird not eating carbs... But hey, everyone have their own tastes. Look, the way I see it, lettuce is cheap. And the more lettuce you put on a burger, the bigger it looks...so why don't you put more lettuce?? So I guess this is a warning for low carb, keto diet people... This isn't the place you're looking for if you're in that category. Overall, let's just say that the beer is good. The service was a bit slow, I think my waiter forgot that I ordered beer as it took forever to get... I'll probably come back, but for me Balter won't be of a place that I'll crave for."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",5/9/2016,4.0,"I've came here twice, and haven't written about both of my experiences. I came here for a dinner, and then a couple of weeks later I came here for Brunch. For my dinner experience:I think the beer by itself is definitely a reason to check this place out. The service was great, as our party was pretty big and was neatly seated on a long bench outside. I ordered the Balter burger, because well you know... if a burger is named after the restaurant it should symbolize and stand for their food. It was alright. It wasn't the worst, but it didn't ""wow"" me I guess? Move onto the craft beer: worth getting and drinking. All in all my dinner experience was great, nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing special in the food department. I do have to note that the Cookie Dessert...was awesome. If you're big on cookies and you like them warm, I would definitely recommend that.My brunch experience:I came back once again for a fellow meetup with yelp friends, but this time for the brunch and with the SO. What did I order? I got the blackened fish tacos, but the SO got the chicken and waffles. I got to try both. If I told you what to get, I would definitely try to push you towards the chicken and waffles. Don't get me wrong, the Blackened Fish Tacos were good, but it's chicken and waffles!Overall, both of my experiences were good and I look forward to my next visit, maybe to just get some brews or a hangout. All I know is that I can come here to get some chicken and waffles for brunch!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ashley R.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/4/2017,4.0,"This is about as good as it gets for brunch in Knoxville. On Saturdays and Sundays this is the place to be. There is a great brunch appetizer bar on weekends with muffins, fresh fruit and salads (which makes up for the time you usually have to wait) and $1 mimosas ($2 doubles). Their beer garden is eclectic and refreshing when the weather is nice. It is lit with hanging lights and has seating for big groups. The food is delicious and never had a bad service experience. I would have given it 5 stars if the parking were good. Parking is the only con to this great place."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michele R.,"Charleston, SC",11/22/2017,5.0,Just passing through this town. Maybe they are known for their beer but the food should not be missed. Beer cheese soup with gruyere cheese was divine and had an amazing burger. Kids had the burrito bowl. Great service. Would stop here again.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Callie G.,"Knoxville, TN",11/19/2017,5.0,"While I've yet to sample any of the brews here, I can definitely attest that they serve up some fabulous dishes. In the multiple times I've eaten here, I have never been disappointed. The portions are ample for the price, and the ingredients seem very fresh in each dish I've tried so far. On Sundays they serve a cold brunch buffet featuring an assortment of baked goods, pastas and salads to munch on. There can be a bit of a long wait during peak times, but the tables tend to open up pretty quickly during the day. My recommendations: the fish and chips, any of the burrito bowls, or my favorite: the flour and blue corn fish tacos with the pintos."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Leslie V.,"Jefferson City, TN",11/16/2017,5.0,OK y'all... I really like this place. Contemporary rustic and industrial atmosphere with very cool outdoor seating. The fire pit is amazing and the beer options are unique. The wait staff is knowledgeable about the microbrews especially the local ones. I recommend the Gouda grilled cheese. It's comfort food at its best with creamy cheeses and buttery fresh bread. The fish taco appetizer is fresh and delicious. The beast hamburger lives up to its name and the hummus is amazing. Go there now.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Leigh Anne T.,"Knoxville, TN",6/22/2020,1.0,I am updating this review because of my experience today. We came in with 6 1/2 and 2 babies. Not an easy seat but they have lots of big tables. It was taking too long to seat us so we decided to split up. My toddler sat with my parents and brother and my mom came over and asked what to get my 2 year old. I asked her what they had and she told me so I picked Mac n cheese.  I work really hard to feed my child healthy. So I saw her food had arrived and I went over to check on her shortly after and I noticed immediately it was Kraft Mac n cheese. First off never would I buy Kraft for my kid to eat and on top of that the kids meals are $6!!!!!! What the heck! She had already started eating it but it makes me furious that the Mac n cheese wasn't homemade. On top of that she got a complementary drink that the server never offered. It really is one of my biggest pet peeves to see a menu for children be $6 and up. I worked at a steakhouse where we offered steak at $6 for kids but boxed Mac in cheese is off the charts ridiculous.

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Leigh Anne T.,"Knoxville, TN",4/18/2016,5.0,I have been dying to try this place. So glad I finally did. Went yesterday for Sunday brunch and sat on the patio. We were greeted promptly and I ordered the chicken and waffles and my husband ordered the fish tacos. Neither disappointed. It was hands down the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and try the regular menu as well.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jen J.,"Knoxville, TN",4/8/2016,4.0,"Balter Beerworks is a nice addition to downtown Knoxville and the bar/restaurant scene. I think the happy hour menu and prices are really great and possibly one of the best in Knoxville. The only thing I would add is at least one option for a liquor drink for those who do not drink beer. The biggest con would be the noise, it's so loud. I would highly suggest to the owners to add some sort of sound barriers to the ceiling or the wall is to absorb some of the noise. Other than that this place is great!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Christine W.,"Needham, MA",8/19/2019,5.0,Stopped by here while driving through Tenn. and had a delicious lunch. I had the Balter burger which I thought was super yummy. My daughter had the breakfast bowl and loved it. They also had a brunch bar set up with a few side salads and a couple bite size desserts which was included and I thought a nice touch with the meal.  This place seems to be a happening hot spot. I definitely would recommend.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Gwendolyn M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/21/2017,5.0,I visited this place for the first time over the weekend as part of the East TN Tours food tour. We were served the burrito bowl and it was super delicious. The food was fresh and the flavors were amazing. The menu looks really appealing and I can't wait to go back to try other dishes. I have heard great things about the Potato Chip Nachos and they sure looked tasty. The place is open and airy and I love the long tables in the dining room. Don't miss this place even if you don't drink beer because the food is reason enough to stop in and eat.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Karl P.,"Wichita, KS",11/13/2018,5.0,Bro. These damn tacos... You can slap about 5 tacos on a plate. Throw the lime juice on it. Gahdamn that's a plate you need. I need to go thank the chef myself. Taco Tuesday pops at Balter Beerworks.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Joel C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1/16/2017,5.0,"Apparently not a lot of breweries are open for lunch or on a Monday in Knoxville, but Balter was! I wasn't sure what to expect when I got there, but when I walked in, I was greeted and was given the option to either sit at the bar or grab a table, but I opted to sit near the bar since no one around. The guy behind the bar was great, as he asked what kind of beers I liked, and he made a few recommendations, and brought me a flight of those after I had finished the Bear Blend Porter. For lunch I had the the grilled cheese sandwich which was a good sized meal for the price, when compared to other places.The long and the short of it is the staff was great and friendly, and the food was terrific, I can definitely see myself going back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jo W.,"Knoxville, TN",7/29/2019,5.0,Very good food & drinks!  Very clean! Loud at times but it's very busy. Parking can be a challenge. Sliders are great!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Janelle B.,"De Pere, WI",4/6/2018,5.0,"We are passing through town on our family minivan roadtripping vacation from South Carolina to Wisconsin and this has been our BEST MEAL the entire vacation!! Great stout! AMAZING FOOD-had the Nachos to start, Baja tacos, fish and chips, bean burger, brew houses burger, and chicken sliders. Best value, best quality and flavor! Parking was fun...on top of a mountain (not really) but we needed the steps! Staff was very friendly and the wait was not bad! Thanks for making this stop totally worth it!!! Go PACK go! (Hint-from Green Bay WI!)"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tim P.,"Blairsville, GA",10/28/2018,1.0,"Sat here almost 1 full hour before order was taken got a coffee and found lettuce floating in cup still waiting on food at this point ok, food showed up southern benedict biscuits were hard and doughy tasting hash browns were cold and partially burned others orders similar one refused to eat cold soggy biscuits. Won't recommend coming here.took another 20 minutes for the bill. Gave 1 star because it won't do a half"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Patrick K.,"Knoxville, TN",4/19/2019,5.0,This is one of the best restaurants in Knoxville. Best beer in town too. I highly recommend the blackened fish tacos and the Bear Blend beer.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Karena P.,"Knoxville, TN",8/14/2016,4.0,"Loved the atmosphere, nice beer selectionI would not go back for dinner again but would def go back for drinks and the potato chip nachos which were amazing"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Suzanne C.,"Blaine, TN",3/29/2016,5.0,"Will go back and try again, no outside waitress but outside area great. Not enough parking and no bike parking as stated. Good bar  areaCame back to try food and all I can say OMG food great gonna be a regular"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Katy B.,"Cincinnati, OH",8/22/2017,5.0,"We stopped here on our way through town and it was the best decision we could have made! Delicious food and great beer. Plus we hit happy hour which was a nice bonus.Thanks for the great food, beer and service!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kayla M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/14/2018,5.0,Amazing dinning experience and wonderful service from Lydia. The Oktoberfest beer is a must try. We will continue coming back for more!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jim D.,"Kernersville, NC",7/20/2018,5.0,"Fresh beers. Loved the summer ale and ipa. Definitely try a flight. I usually make fun of my friends who order fish tacos away from the coast but I took a chance after reading several great reviews. Wow! Blackened cod, fresh cilantro, pickled cabbage. Fantastic. Spicy chicken sliders were are also highly recommended!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Scott P.,"Saint Cloud, FL",5/6/2016,4.0,"Good food, good beer and a great atmosphere. I have only been here once, but if I lived In Knoxville this would be a regular hangout for me. A welcome addition to downtown Knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,George G.,"Knoxville, TN",5/22/2017,2.0,"Stopped on a Saturday afternoon.  My wife and I were really looking forward to the visit.  When we first arrived about 4:15, there was a bit of confusion on the hostess' part, as she didn't know where to seat us even though there were many open tables.  However, we were finally seated and then waited a bit to be greeted by a server.  Finally, our server came and took our drink order.  We started off by ordering the fried green tomatoes.  It took about 10 mins for them to come out, and they were served on a large plate (there were 4).  However, the food was dropped off by a runner, and he disappeared before we could ask (do we have to?) for small plates.  So, we ended up eating them from the large plate the tomatoes were served on.  When our server finally checked on us (she didn't stop to ask if everything looked and tasted okay) the tomatoes were almost gone, but we asked for small plates.  She took that opportunity to ask if we wanted water with our drinks, as well as the small plates.  We said sure.  Again, a bit of a wait later, she brought the water but we never did see any small plates.  The fried green tomatoes were absolutely terrific.  My wife and I sat with empty beer glasses and again hadn't seen our server for a while.  When she finally reappeared at our table, she said that there ""had been a thing"" when apologizing for her absence.  A thing?  She explained that food was being sent to the wrong tables and she straightened it out.    I ordered the Baja fish tacos, and my wife ordered the blackened Mahi wrap.  Both were (again) dropped by a runner that didn't wait around long enough for us to ask for new silverware.  Ours had been taken when the fried green tomato plate was cleared.  Our server didn't stop by our table to ask how the food looked, so after waiting approx 5 mins, I asked another server who was glad to get us new silverware.  The food was terrific.  Flavorful and served hot with a nice presentation.  The micro-brew beer was also good.  However, the service detracted significantly from our first visit here.  Not sure we'll return."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Matthew I.,"Old San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico",5/26/2018,1.0,"Very cool building, great design, wish it were mine. Good location too. The food is decent but someone needs to teach them how to brew beer.  :Q"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Rachel M.,"San Francisco, CA",9/15/2019,5.0,Great food.  Fun atmosphere.  Doggie friendly.   Sunday brunch is good.  Tillamook burger was great and hubby had biscuit and gravy.  I kept stealing his home fries because they were yummy
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Anna G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",11/4/2017,5.0,"I love this place. Ever since it opened, it has been one of my favorite spots in Knoxville. Beer is good. Food is good. Atmosphere is great. Highly recommend the beer flight for anyone who has not been here before. As far as food goes, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I can't wait to come back to Knoxville and try some of the new things they've added."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Peggy M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/10/2016,4.0,Good high gravity IPA. The homemade French fries are really really good. The beer cheese soup is very tasty too. I had an issue with my salad which the GM addressed immediately and I was brought something else to eat in minutes. We will go back.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Colleen T.,"Knoxville, TN",9/3/2018,5.0,"I love Balter. Their beer is awesome, and their food is even better. They make my most favorite fries. If you haven't gone to their Happy Hour - go ASAP. Their deals are crazy."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Michele R.,"Charleston, SC",11/22/2017,5.0,Just passing through this town. Maybe they are known for their beer but the food should not be missed. Beer cheese soup with gruyere cheese was divine and had an amazing burger. Kids had the burrito bowl. Great service. Would stop here again.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,John K.,"Knoxville, TN",8/24/2018,5.0,"I like everything about this place. The beer is fantastic, the food is wonderful and the portions are big. The ambience is the reason I'll keep going back. My gf liked our waiter so much that she tried setting him up with her daughter. Great people, food and atmosphere"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Theresa M.,"Cambridge, WI",8/23/2018,5.0,Great food and great beer! Stopped on the way through town. Easy off and on the highway!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Leslie V.,"Jefferson City, TN",11/16/2017,5.0,OK y'all... I really like this place. Contemporary rustic and industrial atmosphere with very cool outdoor seating. The fire pit is amazing and the beer options are unique. The wait staff is knowledgeable about the microbrews especially the local ones. I recommend the Gouda grilled cheese. It's comfort food at its best with creamy cheeses and buttery fresh bread. The fish taco appetizer is fresh and delicious. The beast hamburger lives up to its name and the hummus is amazing. Go there now.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Vanessa G.,"Santa Ana, CA",12/20/2017,3.0,Food was average. I had the chicken fingers and my friend had the fish and chips nothing special about any of it. Price wasn't worth for how much food we got. Our waitress Laura or Lauren was super friendly and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Paige J.,"Old City, Knoxville, TN",7/22/2018,3.0,"The food is good and the beer is good. Good not great though. The food is slightly overpriced for what it is, but the beer is pretty good. Not the best in Knoxville, but good. The best part about this place in my opinion is the location/venue. The benches outside are a great option for a summer/fall gathering with friends."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ashley R.,"Los Angeles, CA",12/4/2017,4.0,"This is about as good as it gets for brunch in Knoxville. On Saturdays and Sundays this is the place to be. There is a great brunch appetizer bar on weekends with muffins, fresh fruit and salads (which makes up for the time you usually have to wait) and $1 mimosas ($2 doubles). Their beer garden is eclectic and refreshing when the weather is nice. It is lit with hanging lights and has seating for big groups. The food is delicious and never had a bad service experience. I would have given it 5 stars if the parking were good. Parking is the only con to this great place."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sarah H.,"Strongsville, OH",8/11/2019,4.0,This was a great and unique restaurant. The inside was nicely designed and the food was great! My server was wonderful and funny. I had the fried chicken and it was extremely tasty. The only thing I would say is that they broke up our order so we had to wait on the rest of the table to eat. When they did bring out my food it was a little cold but still very good. Definitely a good place to eat and includes parking which is nice downtown.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Addie K.,"St Augustine, FL",7/15/2018,5.0,Jake is an amazing server. Very fun and knows all things Balter and outdoors. He fed us knowledge on the beer selection and continued with the area. Food selection is amazing! Get here early to get a table!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Meredith D.,"Knoxville, TN",6/28/2018,5.0,"We have eaten here several times, and it's about time I left a review! Not much to say, this place speaks for itself. The beer is always cold and really good. The food is top notch. Between my husband and I, we have tried several menu items, but it's almost impossible for me to get past the half gruyere sandwich, half beer cheese soup combo. That beer cheese soup IS something to write home about. We love you balter!!! Keep up the good work. Oh! And it's a great place to take a kid! Our 15 month old loves it."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Alyse W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/8/2017,3.0,"I have been here several times and just have not been too impressed. I've never left angry or anything, it was just OK. I will say, I really like their beer. BUT, I have gotten their burger twice and both times it was way overcooked. Their fish tacos were decent, but again, just ok. I think I'd be more willing to go if parking were easier and if they could cook a burger. Brunch here is pretty good and they have cheap mimosas!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Emily H.,"Johnson City, TN",9/14/2018,5.0,Great place for casual drinks or lunch! The patio area is a great place to hang out. The food is always good. Drinks are great! They also have a wonderful happy hour.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Greg B.,"Knoxville, TN",11/8/2016,5.0,"My favorite place for lunch. I have been here at least 25 times and I have yet to be disappointed. The service is always good and the food never lets me down. I also enjoy the beer. Great selection of different seating types. Indoor, Patio, Breeze way high tops and the beer garden area with fire pit. It is worth a visit!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Buddy W.,"Greenback, TN",6/13/2016,5.0,"Great place to get some history about our great town of Knoxville.The location was awesome when you find out it's history.  And the BEER is GREAT and cold!!!!Friendly Staff, The Shrimp and grits are GREAT! If you can get it on the Brew Tour you get a better perspective on the importance of the history."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Turner M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/12/2018,5.0,"Balter quickly has become my favorite spot in town. You cannot go wrong. Whether you come in for the incredible brunch, or stop by in the afternoon for a great happy hour on the patio, this place will not let you down. Try the skillet cookie for dessert, it puts Chili's same offering to shame."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bobby O.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",5/6/2018,5.0,This is the best brewery in Knoxville. The beer is awesome and the food is spot on. The food reminds me more of an upper class deli than brew pub food. The service is first class. I'll be going here several times a month from now on.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Melanie G.,"Bean Station, TN",7/3/2019,5.0,Amazing beer and food! My Boyfriend and I loved it! Will definitely go back!!! Great friendly employees! Nachos were amazing fish tacos and burger was amazing!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Greg J.,"Knoxville, TN",3/26/2017,5.0,"Ya'll have hit this one over the rear wall and it's still goin'!FANTASTIC:Repurposing an existing building FANTASTICALLY!PlaceServiceMenuBarBeerLocationIt is EXACTLY this sort of place K'twn needs!TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT, we are looking like Asheville did twenty five years ago.Two things; music- more classic Jazz/R&B please for Sunday morning brunch not Saturday nite boozers. Vegetative sound barrier against the noise of Broadway maybe."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jeremy C.,"Kissimmee, FL",4/28/2018,5.0,I ordered the brew house burger and a beer flight and it was great. Their beer is really good and the burger was cooked to perfection!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Brittany W.,"Tampa, FL",9/10/2017,5.0,"We had a fantastic experience for lunch at Balter Beerworks! We had a group of 8 people who came in the late afternoon. We ordered some fried green tomatoes, Chips and Queso with homemade chips and Brussels sprouts which were all so delicious. I really enjoyed my fried chicken sliders and cheese grits. Both were so flavorful and surprisingly not too heavy. Our table also got plenty of salads, burgers and even the lunch burrito bowls and all were very good. Highly recommend to anyone whose going through Knoxville!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Rachelle O.,"Knoxville, TN",9/6/2017,5.0,I have been here several times and have  always had a great experience.  The burgers are big and delicious and the beer is great.  I love the outdoor area and the industrial feel of the inside.  Every single visit here has been a good one so if you are in Knoxville take the drive and check out Balter Beerworks!  It's worth it!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Marion C.,"Knoxville, TN",6/20/2019,2.0,"Balter was my go to place and we went a lot. But the last few experiences have been terrible. Bad service, long wait times on food, wrong orders, and they got rid of my favorite wedge salad. I have heard from other friends they are experiencing the same thing. I hope Balter can go back to the old ways before they loose everyone. Although, they might have already lost me."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sarah S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/14/2017,5.0,Great service and love that they brew their own beer there! We went when it was crowded and were still seated right away. The Baja Fish Tacos were delicious!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kylie R.,"Raleigh, NC",3/14/2018,5.0,"I had brunch here for the first time last Saturday and it was nothing short of amazing! I highly recommend having a reservation though because it gets very busy. Since it is so busy, the wait for food was a little long but, if you order brunch, you can visit the brunch bar as much as you want while you wait. I had the brunch tacos with a side of tomatoes and spinach and it was delicious. The $1 mimosas are also a great deal, although I recommend the $2 double mimosa. Our server was also very attentive and accommodating to our group. I hope to be in the Knoxville area again soon so I can make another visit"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Aya L.,"Portland, OR",9/6/2017,4.0,"Stop by for beer. We sat down outside very nice. Small beer selection but good. Great service,  our waiter brought dog water bowl for my doggy."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Brad Y.,"Columbia, SC",6/8/2019,3.0,Mixed experience. Really cool space. Fantastic drinks. Food was so so...Below expectations for the price point. Well below average service. Inattentive server (appeared to be really stressed and stretched too thin).
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Derrick L.,"Oklahoma City, OK",5/20/2017,4.0,Friendly staff and great patio. Very reasonable lunch prices and a good chicken wrap. Wouldn't hesitate to go there again.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Carmen H.,"Knoxville, TN",2/19/2019,5.0,"My husband had the hot chicken sliders, I had the steak street tacos.  Both were full of flavor and perfectly cooked.  I absolutely loved the pickled fresh veggies on the side of the tacos.  Beers were good.  My husband had the cranberry whiskey sour and loved that it tasted fresh. Service was friendly and attentive.  We are definitely coming back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Elke G.,"Ramstein-Miesenbach, Germany",8/5/2017,2.0,"Bland food. Bland beer. Bland service.It's completely average by all standards. Food. Meh. ""Caramelized"" Brussel sprouts did not hit flavor notes as they were simply grilled in brown sugar. Burgers are made with double patties which is a tad excessive. Flavors were ok, but again, did not hit flavor notes from menu. Beer. Don't expect anything high point (highest is 6%). Signature beers lacked originality. Service. Yikes. Called ahead (as suggested for the weekend) for seating on the patio to accommodate our dog. Arrived to a host in a bad mood who refused to be of assistance in getting a spot in the shade (I and my guest are extremely fair skinned) with a flat out ""there is NO shade."" No effort was made to consider tables that were already paid out and leaving soon. Less than 5 minutes later a table in full shade got up. We moved after MY request (again, no effort made by staff to accommodate us). As a guest I was very thankful to our server who responded with a rather soured face and poor service. We saw the other patio server twice as many times as our own. I spoke to the GM about the poor service and he apologized but made excuses for his staff citing an injury to another server (not ours). Don't bother stopping if you're looking for originality and good service. On a positive note, it's a cool venue with good decor. Overall, nicely done, poorly executed."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Emily B.,"River North, Chicago, IL",5/21/2019,5.0,My husband and I absolutely love Balter Beerworks! There burgers are some of our favorites in Knoxville. They have a good happy hour for food and drinks. There beer selection has nice variety as well.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jessica S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/20/2016,5.0,"My first time here, I was unprepared for just how cool the remodel of this space would be. I was a patron of the previous incarnation. We sat outside and it was a great space. I was happy to see people with their dogs allowed in the patio and eyed the beer garden on the other side of the establishment. What a great addition. My only hangup on this place would be parking. The lot is pretty small but luckily I got a spot. My beer was tasty and I was very impressed with the food we ordered. Everything was very flavorful and the Happy Hour specials made it a great deal for what we got. I recommend the shrimp and grits and the blackened fish tacos. Keep it up, Balter! I keep going back, it's that good!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Brooklyn F.,"Knoxville, TN",5/19/2019,5.0,You guys the gravy is the best thing I've ever tasted. Definitely worth going on sundays and getting the $1 mimosas. The chicken and waffles are also amazing
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Ann R.,"Milwaukee, WI",11/10/2016,2.0,"My first time at Balter, shortly after it opened, was a great experience. The food was good and I really enjoyed the beer. However, I've been back a handful of times and each time since then the beer tastes really watered down. While the food is still good, there are a number of places in Knoxville that provide good food AND good beer. Balter isn't one of them."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Stephanie H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/17/2017,4.0,"Ate brunch here for the first time yesterday. Phenomenal avocado toast, great one dollar mimosas, and awesome cold bar included. Service was a little slow, but it was Sunday brunch so that's to be expected. Will definitely be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jill V.,"Knoxville, TN",5/30/2017,5.0,"Oh my gosh! That's all I have to say :) Just kidding...I have more to say. I LOVE BALTER BEERWORKS!! We got the pita and olive/pimento cheese dips and it was to die for. Their speciality beers are delicious, reasonably priced and they give you lots to choose from! For your meal, I personally suggest the grilled Gouda sandwich. This place is a treasure to have in Knoxville! We'll be back for sure!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Brian H.,"Maryville, TN",1/7/2018,1.0,Drinks way too expensive and how does a place loose one of the best chefs in Knoxville. Stroble helped make the place
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Brandon S.,"Knoxville, TN",6/21/2017,2.0,"My gf and I tried Balter Beerworks for the first time after hearing a lot of good things but we both were actually disappointed with our meals ... very bland . The burger I had was the 7oz and still the burger didn't fill the bun and it was mediocre as far as taste ... I'm always the type to give credit where credit is due , so I have to say it was very clean and sitting outside on the patio was very nice . I won't be going back myself ."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Carlos H.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",12/21/2017,3.0,"This is my first time eating here. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any beers. I did however get some food. I ordered the (funny name for cheese) Tillamooka Burger, if you asked what it meant, it was the name of the cheese on it. It was a mediocre burger, only served medium-medium well done. Not too disappointed about the way it was cooked, I wasn't expecting a high quality piece of meat but still, the burger was just ""ok"". My significant other ordered the Club, and sorta felt the same way. The mention of Chipotle Mayo intrigued her, and was barely noticed. The sweet potato fries I ordered were great for being waffle fries, which let's face it, always makes fries awesome but, weren't really sweet at all. Not to say it was a horrible experience but definitely not worth $30. The service was great, everyone was very inviting, the vibe in there was loud and chill, and I bet there were just better things on the menu to order but it just wasn't their night, tonight. Overpriced and painfully average food."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jamie M.,"Columbus, OH",1/1/2017,5.0,"I really like this place. The atmosphere is great, not too loud or quite. The service is excellent, they have a good collection of beers of tap, and the food is amazing. I had their regular burger with a mitchell beef patty and it was cooked just to my liking. Many places overcook the way I like my burgers, but not Balter beerworks. The mac n cheese was great too, not too rich. The fries were incredible, salted perfectly. I had a bite of the club and I don't usually think club sandwiches are anything special, but this one was pretty good. Finally, we ended with the pumpkin cheesecake. This cheesecake was truly incredible, cheesecake is my favorite dessert and I am a snob about it and yet this was some of the best cheesecake I have ever had. The pumpkin flavor was not too strong and the crust was incredible. Balter beerworks is definitely a great addition to knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kevin B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/31/2016,5.0,Great find!  The food is amazing.  Order the Beast Burger (my fav).  The beer is great esp the Bear Blend.  Atmosphere is cool.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Don I.,"Clinton, TN",12/19/2016,5.0,"If you are thirsty and hungry and in Knoxville, TN go to the Balter Beerworks. For some very good beer and a double cheeseburger that was out of this world. And the industrial atmosphere make for a good night out. Or just lunch."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Joe H.,"Knoxville, TN",12/19/2016,5.0,"I love this place. Great beers and great food. They're a brewery and I've not had a bad beer, though my favorite is the May Pop.  My go-tos for food are the Jackson Ave Salad or the Fish and Chips, though they also have cheap and good tacos during happy hour. The outside area is a good place to spend an evening in the summer and fall."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Clark G.,"Washington, DC",12/19/2016,5.0,"Outstanding place to eat and have a quality beer. I've been meaning to come here for a while and I finally had the chance to stop in for lunch. My wife and I split the potato chip nachos, which were delicious. I had the Grilled cheese and tomato basil soup. Sandwich was perfect but the soup was the star! Rich and creamy with a spice I couldn't put my finger on. My wife got the blackened fish tacos. She said they had the best flavor of any fish tacos she had tasted. On top of that, their beer is fantastic. My wife is a Blue Moon type of girl, but she loved the Good Neighbor. I had a flight of four beers. Fantastic!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Joey D.,"Knoxville, TN",12/19/2016,5.0,"Delicious beer and great food here.  I love Balter.  And, it's about 100 yards from my apartment, which is both awesome and dangerous.  I think most have said how great this place is already, so I won't go too crazy.  However, the meditteranean chicken salad is terrific.  AND, go for brunch.  This is an awesome downtown brunch spot.  And, they have parking. Boom."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Harris F.,"Marietta, GA",12/16/2016,5.0,"Really enjoyed the food, atmosphere and beer! Great service too! Had Tyler as our waiter!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Mike R.,"Clayton, NC",12/12/2016,5.0,"Passing through town and found this place on Yelp. Got a little disoriented when Google brought me to the upper parking area. But got down there and it was worth it! Go see Megan, she did a great job with drinks and not only was she gorgeous, she was friendly. I had their IPA and the locally distilled corn whiskey. I got to speak with the owner as well. Their food menu is built around their four main brewed beers. They have 3 or so more beers coming soon on tap. And if the town is lucky enough, they will bottle and resale their beer in the local market. You can buy growlers now, that's an option. So if you're looking for a place that has locally (onsite!) brewed beer and great food, give them a try!!! (Try the seasonal hamburger and their firebelly IPA - don't defile the burger with ketchup or some crazy sauce, eat it just like they serve it, your stomach and taste buds WILL thank you!!)"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Constantin L.,"Knoxville, TN",12/12/2016,5.0,Their fried chicken sliders are incredible!! Beer was great and service was good as well. Really enjoyed our time there.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Gretchen R.,"Needham, IN",12/7/2016,5.0,"I need more Balters in my life. Can we get a hand clap for that happy hour? Cheap drinks + food? Balter, if you were a man, you'd have my heart! Can't get enough of the Yeehaw brew and so glad they have it on tap. Also chicken biscuit sandwich thingys (great description right?) are so good. I'd like them to come in groups of 20. If you're like me and enjoy a good Mike, look no further. Balters has THE BEST. Like...top three Moscow mules in my life. This is not a joke people...go here."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Seth K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1/1/2017,4.0,"Great food, I came for the brunch on New Years Day. The breakfast bowl was delicious and filling, the bloody balter (think Bloody Mary with a bit of coffee porter) was okay, but I don't love Bloody Mary's anyway. The music was a touch loud for my taste but I was able to think and get work done. Staff were attentive and courteous."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tori M.,"Knoxville, TN",4/16/2017,5.0,Amazing brewery!! I love the selection of beer and the food is great too. The pimento cheese is some of the best I've had- definitely get it! The atmosphere is great for a weekend or weeknight with friends. The brewery is walking distance from other places to see in downtown Knoxville.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Beth L.,"El Paso, TX",4/15/2017,5.0,"In Tennessee, this was the best beer we had of the brews we tried. The waitstaff was chill, but they were prompt. Friendly hostess. If it wasn't raining, we would have loved to sit on their awesome patio. The food was really good; some of the healthiest brew food to date. Fish Tacos were yummy!!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Dina B.,"Charlotte, NC",10/12/2018,5.0,Great food and service. Fried green tomatoes were great.  Salmon salad was awesome.  Had a saisons beer which was great too.  My server was friendly and did a great job.  When I am back in town I hope to eat there again.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tucker H.,"Knoxville, TN",4/16/2016,5.0,"My new favorite dive on the edge of downtown! Their sliders and tacos at happy hour are the best. It's exciting to see Jackson Avenue coming back to life, and this place is the perfect addition to Knoxville's urban revitalization!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jessica W.,"La Mesa, CA",10/14/2016,1.0,"Absolutely horrible for large group. Reservation was made on Monday for Thursday. The group shows up and it took 30 minutes for me to get my water and 1.5 hour to get my food. The service was extremely lacking. One person sitting at my table did not get their order taken until at least half an hour after mine was taken. Food wise, they are inconsistent, to say the least. The patties in my balter burger was dry and overcooked but another person said theirs was juicy and good. The side of mac and cheese was good for both of us, however. 2 of the people in our party ordered fish and chips and the plates came out completely different. One was golden brown and crunchy while the other was pale and soggy. One of them had no salt added to their fries and no side tartar sauce."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Paige B.,"New York, NY",7/17/2017,5.0,"Best shrimp & grits in Knoxville. Literally, writing this review is making me want to go there now. Must eat place if you are in Knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sue E.,"Bordentown, NJ",11/27/2016,5.0,"Excellent on every level. We were there for a late lunch while traveling to Nashville. Easy access off the interstate, great beers, solid lunch menu with delicious food. Prompt, friendly service. Will definitely be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sarah V.,"Knoxville, TN",3/26/2019,5.0,The potato chip nachos are one of our favorite things in town!! I also LOVE the street tacos and beer!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,John R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/12/2018,4.0,Their club sandwich is very good. Maybe the best I have had.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,John R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2016,4.0,"Pretty good place. Unique setup. Varied design. Three different types of outdoor places to sit. Lots of windows if you sit inside. I like the location. Easy to get to and park. Good burgers and mac and cheese. I have added it to my ""rotation"" of places to go.Only negative is the chairs at the indoor tables. Uncomfortable and the backs of the chairs lean too far back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Christopher S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/9/2016,4.0,"Happy to visit on grand opening day.  Menu has very nice selection of gourmet pub fare. Burger and fish tacos were tasty.  Service and precision of order a little off due to first night, new staff, a few kinks to be worked out.  Beers were solid, esp ipa and pale ale. Very cool what they've done with the location, only one con, need to improve acoustics, very noisy.  Close parking is limited but worth very short walk. Great addition to Scruffy City!  Will be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kevin P.,"Knoxville, TN",4/3/2016,5.0,"I figured I'd wait until I'd been more than once to write a review, but I have to say this is one of the best places in all of Knoxville. I've gotten the burger (apparently it uses Mitchell Farms beef) a couple of times and it's without question every bit as good as Stock & Barrel. I've also gotten the tenders a couple of times and they're actually the best I've ever had. Hell, even the Fish & Chips was pretty damn spectacular; and this is coming from someone who doesn't really eat fish! So yeah, the food's all pretty amazing and made fresh to order (which is a huge plus). Oh, and for those of you that care, they use as much local stuff as possible, to boot. The service has always been top notch for me, though I've only gotten a table once (I normally sit at the bar). I will warn that the place is EXTREMELY loud, probably owing to always being really busy and lots of hard surfaces for sound to reflect off. It's not bothersome to me at all and I'd expect that sort of thing. There's outside seating as well, which is really nice. As for the beer? It won't blow you away, but it's still GOOD. I'd say their beers are solid examples of their styles. Nothing too unusual or particularly out of the ordinary but good enough to drink a few of. I'm not going to dock any points for the beer because I think it's probably what they're going for; accessible, drinkable beers that won't put anyone off too much."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Janine A.,"Knoxville, TN",2/28/2016,3.0,So the beer is on point here. The food? Meh... very friendly wait staff. Beware the Weekend crowds and do not attempt with a large group!! Super packed/loud.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Constantin L.,"Knoxville, TN",12/12/2016,5.0,Their fried chicken sliders are incredible!! Beer was great and service was good as well. Really enjoyed our time there.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Aaron J.,"Knoxville, TN",3/22/2016,4.0,"The location is amazing and the atmosphere is fantastic.  I'm really grateful to have a place like this in Knoxville.  It kind of reminds me of Wicked Weed. The food is very good but the beer is just okay.  They brew very basic beers and aren't anything impressive.  I would love for them to do some big bold hoppy beers, saisons, sours, etc.  It feels like their beers are catering more toward that macro beer drinker who's just getting into craft beer.  I understand they just opened so I'm going to keep going back and hoping they just get better and better at the beer part, but they have the food down."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,J S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/19/2016,4.0,"Location:  I'm incredibly impressed with the renovation on this location.  When I heard the gas station would be converted, even the renderings did not look impressive.  However, seeing it in person, I'm now a big fan.Food: I had the chicken tacos and the blackened fish street tacos.  Both were great, and the fish was definitely my favorite!Service: Actually wasn't very good.  The waiter was quite slow and not all that attentive.  2.5 out of 5 stars on service.Pricing: Actually fairly reasonable and I hope it stays that way.  I will probably come here all the time unless they increase prices.  I will probably become a regular if it stays this way!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Alex O.,"Miami Beach, FL",2/18/2016,5.0,"Amazing beer. Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. Absolutely nailed the concept and have put so much care into making the best beer and some of the best food in Knoxville. I love food and local restaurants and cannot recommend Balter highly enough. You literally can't order a bad thing. Cheers, Balter...you're exactly what Knoxville has been needing."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Scott G.,"Knoxville, TN",3/1/2019,5.0,"First time in Knoxville and happened to find this place. Really cool atmosphere, great beer, great food. A must visit when in Knoxville. Close to many great spots in downtown and also one of the stops on the brewery bus. Can't wait to head back to this place."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Aaron J.,"Louisville, KY",5/14/2017,4.0,"Stopped in here when I was in town visiting a friend, and I am glad I did. It was happy hour so steak tacos and mini fried chicken sliders were only $1.50. Both were very delicious. As for beer, they had 8 house beers on tap that are brewed at the location. I had their house Hefeweizen and stout. The Hefe was pretty good but I really liked the stout. It had a slight milk/cream taste with a stronger coffee flavor but did not have the burnt or over toasted taste that some stouts have, which I do not like. If I'm ever in Knoxville and have time, I will definitely be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,John G.,"Knoxville, TN",2/29/2016,4.0,"I went in expecting not to like and I was dead wrong. It's bigger than I expected, had seen reviews about how crowded and loud it was, but I got there around 3pm and bellied right up to the bar. The bar staff were very friendly and welcoming, that means a lot to me. I only had some beers, so can tell you nothing about their food, but they have their own kitchen and menu. This place still feels like a garage, but in a cool way. Lot of younger patrons, everyone seemed happy and having a good time. I had two of their beers, the Jackson Dubbel and their IPA. They were both pretty good and I'm kinda a beer snob, wouldn't call the beers world class but certainly some of the best in the city. The beer had nice foam and lattice on the side of the glass, perfect head. Parking can be tricky, but other than that, this place warrants another visit soon! Oh yeah, think Happy Hour is M-F from 3-6:30 with beers at 3 bucks. Nice."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sam H.,"Abingdon, VA",8/4/2016,4.0,"Good food, good beer selection. What more can you ask for? It's in a renovated gas station, & the redesign is clever. Definitely heading back here when I'm in town!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lindsey L.,"Dallas, TX",8/3/2016,3.0,"Here's my biggest problem: They turned off the music in that passive-aggressive, we're-about-to-close-so-gtfo way an hour and a half before they actually closed. Yes, we were the last people there. No, we did not stay past closing. Yes, we spent a significant amount of money. When we arrived, the waiter acted unbelievably annoyed that he had customers. I have no patience for this. I waited tables for several years, and I know the importance of smiling and making eye contact. This guy did not. Then we got another waitress who was so much better. The food and beer were subpar. Would I go here again? Absolutely not. Way overpriced for the quality. They need to seriously review their customer service policies."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Wayne S.,"Florence, SC",7/30/2016,5.0,Hands down the best service I have received in Knoxville. The waitress was really sweet and very attentive to our table. I am only in town for a couple more weeks and will definitely be back.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Gia S.,"Philadelphia, PA",7/29/2016,5.0,"Where to start? We stopped by for dinner and drinks after a stranger recommended this place to us at a beer tasting we attended. There is outdoor seating, a patio, bar seating, and tables inside. We went on a Friday evening and they were packed. We were told it was a 20-30 minute wait but luckily we were seated in about 5-10.We started off with a flight of their own brewed beer, and they were all really good, especially the Kosch and Wheat beers. We also tried the Yeehaw Berliner Weiss but that was a lot more tart than anticipated. For appetizers, we started with the beer cheese nachos and they were out of this world. The beer cheese soup was also really good.For dinner, I had the mac and cheese. It somehow tasted a little bland, so I asked for a side of beer cheese and poured it on the Mac and cheese and it was amazing. My boyfriend had the beast burger, which was really good but definitely heavy on the ingredients and will leave you in a food coma.Our waitress was helpful, the beer was great, and the food was incredible. My only tip is that they should really make soft pretzels to go with that beer cheese. I'm sure we'll be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Christina B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/27/2016,4.0,"So happy to finally Have Balter Beerworks in the old BP space.  As a lover and beer, this place is able to satisfy my needs with great results.  They brew their own beer, and also have other craft beer on tap besides theirs.  Thank you!  Sometimes i'm craving something light, and since the  good neighbor isn't one of my favorites or anything too hoppy for that matter, I am able to try one of the rotating drafts.  The food is great including Brunch ($1 mimosas)  and happy hour (M-F 3 to 6:30). Happy hour is one of the best with:$3 draft beer$1.50 tacos and sliders$3 chips and queso$4 pimento and hummus plateOne of my favorite meals is the many options for fish tacos!  The only complaint here is that  the option is only soft flour and hard corn.  As a lover of soft corn tortillas it is a diabolical to not have this option.  Please Please consider an authentic option for us corn tortilla  lovers.  The best part of Balter is the large outside seating that includes a patio and beer garden with hanging lights (awwwww).Besides my Tortilla meltdown, everything here is delicious, including dessert!  Parking is a hassle at busy times, as there are only a handful of spaces in front of the restaurant, but you can park on the street and the lot across from Sweet P's."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jessica S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/20/2016,5.0,"My first time here, I was unprepared for just how cool the remodel of this space would be. I was a patron of the previous incarnation. We sat outside and it was a great space. I was happy to see people with their dogs allowed in the patio and eyed the beer garden on the other side of the establishment. What a great addition. My only hangup on this place would be parking. The lot is pretty small but luckily I got a spot. My beer was tasty and I was very impressed with the food we ordered. Everything was very flavorful and the Happy Hour specials made it a great deal for what we got. I recommend the shrimp and grits and the blackened fish tacos. Keep it up, Balter! I keep going back, it's that good!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Laura S.,"Key Largo, FL",7/12/2016,5.0,"We sat at the open bar area to take advantage of the beautiful day and bar service Laura was our server / bartender and was excellent -  running around in 5 different directions,  but cheery, professional, personable  and always aware of all her guests - inside and outside Food...,Ordered the blackened fish tacos which were served with a hard blue corn taco wrapped in a grilled flour tortilla, loaded with fish and toppings  -   Excellent fresh flavor served hot. The  beans and rice were good but we filled up on tacos so barely ate them Drinks....Amazing Habibitini !   Going to the distillery just a half block away to continue to try their local liquor options Beer flight was good - my husband loved seeing a cask ale as an option   Keep those coming! The servers all awesome but obviously stations were not well laid out or too big or some one called in sick.   You can tell the staff worked together and I saw the kitchen crew bringing food out as well.  Love that (as a former restaurant person)  seeing teams work together SuggestionWith the guest beers list you should note location of brewery. We looked them up ( 4 Knox and 1 Asheville) More parking please !!I would also note on your menu that the distillery is only a half block away.   What a cool thing! We will be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/8/2016,4.0,"Came here for the grand opening and it was extremely grand. I ordered a veggie burger and didn't know it was coming with a side of fries. My veggie burger was a meat burger..I had to confirm it with 2 meat eaters because sometimes veggie burgers really do taste like meat! The owner, maybe, swapped it for me and asked what side I wanted. They have so many options for side! I went with the mac and cheese and it was so cheesy! Yum. They have a wide range of drinks too but I didn't try any because I left my ID in the car which was parked behind the theatre - I wasn't up for the walk again. I later found out I could have parked at the garage for free..I had a mocktail and I was content. I have zero alochol tolerance anyways. As for the dessert. That was grand! A huge chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. Yum Yum! The best part of a meal will always be the dessert. I ate more than the other peeps I was sharing with. It was so warm, moist, chewy and the chocolate chips were gooing. Now that's a legit cookie! The ambience is great for socializing and hanging out."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sandra H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/6/2016,5.0,"Great spot to snag some lovely food and tasty bevs. Got there just after the weekday lunch crowd and were seated immediately--and immediately ordered a cab, a Harbitini (not too sweet) and an ice cold Moscow mule (heavy on the ice). Blackened fish tacos (cod, I think), burrito bowl and beer cheese soup rounded out the meal and the bellies. Server Chris was uber helpful on food and drink selections (yeah--it's a brewery but the signature cocktails were the order of the day). Much better than my 1st experience there several months ago--I will be back!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Steve G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/3/2016,3.0,"Good food, okay beer, and a little too expensive."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Wayne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4/12/2016,4.0,"Brand new spot and my first time there . . . ultra modern micro-brewery all decked out in concrete, exposed HVAC, with cool wait staff. Outdoor seating and detached brew house. Oh, the food! Tried soft tacos with blackened fish. Like them a bunch! Didn't try and brews at lunch but will be returning to do that and probably try fish & chips next."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Melanie K.,"Knoxville, TN",9/11/2016,3.0,Thank goodness the food and Bloody Mary was good. The beer is no comparison to the breweries in Knoxville. So if you're looking for good food this may be your place. I would not go for the beer.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tammy J.,"Alcoa, TN",3/27/2016,5.0,"The shrimp and grits are awesome, even following a month in Louisiana. Nice snack/fruit bar for everyone during brunch. Burgers looked great--can't wait to try next time. Staff and manager were excellent. Comfy casual atmosphere. Great mix of people."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Stacey L.,"Knoxville, TN",1/6/2017,3.0,"This gets 3 stars only because the food and beer is decent.  It's impossible to hear anyone at your table talking because of the acoustics, the service has been very poor all three times I've gone, and their chairs are soooo uncomfortable. I wanted to like it, but I just can't."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jennie H.,"Knoxville, TN",5/20/2016,4.0,"Great lunch here with a large group. The food is way above your average pub food. I had the Baja fish tacos. Very fresh and flavorful. I am looking forward to returning to try the beer and some of the other menu items. A table mate had the potato chip nachos and they looked delish. The only improvement I can suggest is the noise level. Concrete floors and open ceilings, while fashionable, create a clamor."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Heather D.,"Seattle, WA",5/2/2016,4.0,"The HH (happy hour) food is amazing, roommate loves the beer. I'm allergic sadly so I can't talk on that, but the mini tacos, burgers and sliders are bomb.com. Stop in before the rush, it does get VERY busy."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,John C.,"Atlanta, GA",3/23/2016,5.0,I love this place.  Easily the coolest new place in Knoxville.  The beer is second to none.  The food is unbelievable.  The atmosphere is really fun.  Anyone that has not been there yet should definitely push it to the top of their list.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Pete M.,"North Beach, MD",8/4/2016,4.0,Diverse enough menu to please our party which included a 90 year old grandma. I recommend trying the flight of local beers. They range from light American to an interesting coffee stout. Their IPA was well balanced and hoppy. Food was reasonably priced; we enjoyed the fish tacos quite a bit! Would go back!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lindsey L.,"Dallas, TX",8/3/2016,3.0,"Here's my biggest problem: They turned off the music in that passive-aggressive, we're-about-to-close-so-gtfo way an hour and a half before they actually closed.

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Shy C.,"Albany, GA",10/20/2018,5.0,Good food! Had the nacho chips (I think that's the name) and they were amazing. My husband had a burger....GOOD! I ordered the burrito bowl for my entree.....DELISH! Good atmosphere and we had great service as well.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Linnea C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2016,5.0,"We came for brunch on a Sunday and were very impressed. They were obviously very busy but we were sat immediately. Our server was friendly and attentive and our waters were always full. The $1 mimosas are a great deal, and the brunch menu has lunch items (for those of you who don't like breakfast food!) There is also a small complimentary buffet for brunch with fruit, pasta salad, cookies, and muffins. We didn't get a chance to try the beer, but the food, service, and atmosphere are excellent! Highly recommend."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,James N.,"Fort Collins, CO",3/13/2016,2.0,"I realize this place is new and they're probably still figuring things out for themselves, but... this was my third time here. The food is average, but way too expensive for the portions and quality. On my recent visit they only had 3 beers available. The spring session ale tasted like Miller Lite, that is, carbonated water. The IPA is (was, I guess, since it's no longer available) the best thing about this place. There is better food and definitely better beer to be found in Knoxville. That being said, the service has always been outstanding. The waiters and waitresses do a great job even when it's slammed."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Dustin R.,"Nashville, TN",3/8/2016,5.0,"Love Balter. They have great knowledgable Brewers with top notch craft beer. And the food is real good too, sometimes unusual for brewpubs, good thing this is a up class modern brewpub. ;)"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Julie F.,"Athens, OH",3/6/2016,5.0,"Was worried when I saw how crowded the parking area was, but I found a spot. When we arrived, the menu was switching from Sunday brunch to dinner. My choice was the shrimp and grits with andouille sausage. It was dripping with butter and soooo creamy and delicious. Our waitress was appropriately attentive; not overbearing. We stayed for 2 hours chatting and our waitress didn't interfere, letting my dinner mate and I get reacquainted after a long absence between visits. Good luck to the owners as they expand and establish a presence in Knoxville."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Joseph W.,"Knoxville, TN",6/8/2016,5.0,Thought it would just be a pub/bar type atmosphere but the food was incredible. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Candace C.,"Trenton, TN",5/28/2016,5.0,"Service was great. Patio atmosphere was so nice. One of the guys there even came by and asked us if he could tilt our umbrella when the sun began hitting my friend's back. I loved it that we didn't have to ask!And the food- oh, yummy!!!! I got the baja fish tacos & I recommend! Ask for their peach tea to go with it. If I lived in Knoxville, I'd be a regular here."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Chris D.,"Knoxville, TN",9/18/2016,4.0,"Great food, cool atmosphere. Staff are young and friendly. The burrito bowl was REALLY good! Would have a 5 star but parking is tough. Worth the extra walk up the hill from the pay lot."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Gabe R.,"Talbott, TN",3/13/2016,5.0,Great food awesome beer and cool atmosphere! Come check it out for sure if your in Knoxvegas!!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,A H.,"Mesa, AZ",8/15/2017,4.0,"Had lunch here with a friend and it was excellent. They weren't terribly crowded so the survive was excellent. I had the lunch fish & chips. There was only one piece of fish, which made for a good size for lunch; I didn't over eat! The fish was light and not greasy; it was fantastic. The fries weren't particularly hot. My friend had the salmon salad salad and almost licked his plate clean. Will definitely return."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Brad L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/29/2016,3.0,Cool place but in my opinion they should offer flights of their crafted beer. It would make money.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bernie B.,"Knoxville, TN",8/29/2018,3.0,"Hmmm.  When you look at many of the reviews of Balters, you hear people comment on the great food. While true, the food is excellent generally (I have enjoyed the fish and chips particularly), this is a *brewery*. The food should be secondary to good beer, and well, it just isn't. The beer here is ""meh"". Nothing outstanding, very commercially blah. The porter is weak, though brown, and the lighter beers are flavored waters with carbonation. It is pretty awful, when the most enticing beer on the menu is from another brewery (e.g.: YeeHaw Dunkel) The place is gorgeous, no question; small and intimate, food is very good, but I rate breweries on beer, and it needs work."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Stacy G.,"Knoxville, TN",8/23/2018,3.0,I had brunch here on Sunday and I was less than impressed. I had the biscuit and gravy with a side of potatoes. I asked for the gravy on the side and they sent out one open faced biscuit with a ramekin of gravy and it was $12.  The waitress later told me next time I should just order a biscuit with a side of gravy because it would be much cheaper. Seems like she might have mentioned this when I ordered. I did enjoy their Mimosas but wouldn't go back for brunch again. It was overpriced for the quality.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Emma Caroline V.,"Knoxville, TN",8/13/2018,5.0,Brunch brunch brunch. Go get Sunday brunch. $1 single mimosas $2 doubles and $4 Bloody Mary. I got fried green tomato Benedict and it was to die for.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Regina G.,"Destin, FL",10/9/2018,5.0,"I come here almost every Sunday I absolutely love their brunch. The drink specials are great, food is great, atmosphere is great. If you're looking for an amazing brunch place this is it!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Eddie O.,"Knoxville, TN",4/8/2016,3.0,"This place is very popular. Its hype is somewhat mystifying. They only had 4 of their own brews tapped of which I had 2 ( the good neighbor and the Bear blend...both were average tasting. They definitely were not worthy of $5 a pint. I ordered the Balter burger with Ranchero beans and rice. The beans and rice were great but the burger was lacking. The bun was bland, lettuce limp, and patties were dry. The waitress was nice and did a good job training a new employee."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sam H.,"Abingdon, VA",8/4/2016,4.0,"Good food, good beer selection. What more can you ask for? It's in a renovated gas station, & the redesign is clever. Definitely heading back here when I'm in town!"

balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jacquelynn B.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",5/31/2018,5.0,The food here was great!!! From the minute we sat down at the side bar Lori was so sweet and hospitable to us. She made us delicious Bloody Mary's for a good price. We missed happy hour but the happy hour deals are great. Will be returning.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,James S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/4/2016,4.0,"Awesome little place. Fantastic beer, friendly service,pretty good food, great prices, and they even have parking. I also liked how spacious the dining areas were, I hate it when greedy owners try to shoehorn too many tables into a small loud dinning room."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Missy B.,"Powell, TN",9/14/2017,5.0,The food is great. Everything we have tried has been excellent! And the bear blend beer- if you love coffee you gotta try it. The service was not great but you can't beat the food. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Holly O.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",4/29/2018,5.0,I've been to balter many times and my experience is always great! Brunch is amazing on the weekend! I had the breakfast bowl this morning which was absolutely delicious! Nora is an amazing server. She was very attentive and sweet and I will continue to come back. Thank you!!!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,David P.,"Memphis, TN",4/1/2016,3.0,"Very strong on the beer. Started with the Bear Blend. It was good, but a little simple for a porter. The Coffee tones were good. The IPA was great. Unfortunately, the 45 minute estimate turn to 75 and did not result in a table until I asked the hostess.   Once seated that Beer and water came quickly. The food took a long time and seemed that it had been sitting for a bit. The favors were good. Trying to pay took way too long."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Phil S.,"Oak Ridge, TN",3/13/2016,5.0,"Best lunch, dinner and late night atmosphere in Knoxville; with some of the best food and beer around!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Sarah N.,"Knoxville, TN",11/6/2017,4.0,"Had a great experience while at Balter Beerworks. We sat in the beer garden area- great area to sit and relax! Beer and cocktails were terrific, and food was great too! Service was exceptional. We will def be going back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kevin K.,"Springville, AL",9/2/2017,4.0,Really good burgers and the chip nachos were on point! Beer was pretty good and the coffee oatmeal porter was really good!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Joe W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/26/2018,3.0,"This place is alright in terms of food, but very overpriced. There's a lot of comparable food for more reasonable prices in the same area."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Will P.,"Yadkinville, NC",10/14/2017,1.0,"This place gave us a terrible time from the very start. After a 45 minute wait for a party of 2 with free tables everywhere, we were told that we could sit at the high tops by the bar, or wait for another table to open up, so we elected the bar. After waiting a solid 10 minutes to be acknowledged at all, we ordered our first round and waters. The waitress returned with the water about 5 minutes later, but no sign of the beers. I ordered a flight, my girlfriend a dry cider we had at another restaurant previously that was delicious. When it finally arrived, one of the beers in my flight was gone, fine, so she brought something similar. 3/4 of their beers (produced in house) in my flight were mediocre at best. My girlfriends cider on the other hand, tasted awful. Like a farmhouse ale went through their taps previously and festered there and had a cider run through it without a proper cleaning in between. It's around 8:30 at this point, and we're starving. The restaurant is busy, but our waitress was spending most of her time talking to the bartender, and none taking our orders. We sat with menus in front of us for 45 minutes. The waitress finally shows up to an adjacent table and I flagged her down to ask her to take our orders. She relies, ""Oh are y'all hungry? Would you like something to eat?"" Why the hell else would I be in your restaurant??... the music was way to loud, service was terrible, and we never even got food. Downed our shitty beers and walked down to the awesome BBQ restaurant a block down. Save your time and money. Hit that BBQ place"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,James w.,"Middleton, WI",6/29/2017,5.0,"Great place.  Stuck kinda out of the way, close enough to the homeless underpass for some edginess.  Food is well made pub food.  Happy hour is a great time to go to try the apps.  I like the tacos and fried green tomatoes with homage pimento cheese. Beers are good but limited selection so they add guest taps.  I'd go with theirs.  Their beers have a crispness that makes them unique compared to many of Knoxpatch's other breweries.  A had a wheat that was really a wit minus the orange peel and coriander, but on a 90 degree day that was fine.  Had a cherry vanilla brown from a cask that should have been kept until Christmas but it was not cloying or heavy as so many are.  A lot of folks dismiss this place as too modern for the Scruffy City, and dismiss their beers on that impression.  Well they aren't hop bombs thank god!  They're actually good!  Cheers!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Daryl R.,"Greer, SC",12/30/2017,4.0,We ate here with friends. Had a very friendly waiter. The place was clean.  We ordered off the regular menu and the food came well presented and timely. We would come back.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Brad W.,"White House, TN",6/8/2017,1.0,Really shi*ty management. Server was great but the management were being complete jerks about putting a big game on the screen outside. Will not be returning to this place. Don't waste your time on this joke of a brewery.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lori G.,"Knoxville, TN",2/12/2016,1.0,"First Yelp review of my life... We stood at the bar for over 20 minutes waiting to order a beer, or at minimum be acknowledged, neither of which happened. In fact, when I called out, nicely but with my beer choice, he said ""what"".  Rude. Saddened. Unknoxville-like. We left. And the Jig it was!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Wayne S.,"Florence, SC",7/30/2016,5.0,Hands down the best service I have received in Knoxville. The waitress was really sweet and very attentive to our table. I am only in town for a couple more weeks and will definitely be back.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Arianna B.,"Knoxville, TN",2/21/2016,3.0,"While the trendy atmosphere is incredible, the beer left me disappointed! I was hoping for so real craft beer that could somewhat rival nearby cities! I will try again a few months later to see if they worked out the kinks."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Maria C.,"Knoxville, TN",10/12/2017,5.0,I have eaten here at least a dozen times and have enjoyed every beverage and food item I've ever tried. Great service and atmosphere also!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kevin B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/31/2016,5.0,Great find!  The food is amazing.  Order the Beast Burger (my fav).  The beer is great esp the Bear Blend.  Atmosphere is cool.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Harris F.,"Marietta, GA",12/16/2016,5.0,"Really enjoyed the food, atmosphere and beer! Great service too! Had Tyler as our waiter!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Elizabeth G.,"Knoxville, TN",11/7/2016,4.0,Service was pretty bad but the food and beer was very good! They have great happy hour specials!
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Jacci F.,"Knoxville, TN",3/3/2016,4.0,"Finally made it in last night - the wait staff is amazing.  They are friendly, helpful and they know all about their beer offerings.  One of my pet peeves is that I live downtown and I don't see why more restaurants don't have call ahead seating.  I live a block away - I don't think I should have to stand outside for 40 minutes to get a table.  The waitress told me that they use the No Wait app for onliine reservations.  The beer was great, the food was good and they did an amazing job with an old gas station!  I thought they were crazy opening where there was no parking and even less reason to head down to that area, but I was wrong!  Good for them!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Susan F.,"Knoxville, TN",2/19/2016,5.0,"Here's to Balter! I am not much of a beer drinker, so I had the Good Neighbor Kolsch and it was nice and light. The fried green tomatoes topped with melted pimento cheese were amazing. I followed this with the light Mediterranean salad, which made for a perfect meal.  Of course, we couldn't leave without having the warm skillet big cookie with Cruze Farm vanilla ice cream scooped on top, melting into the cookie. Going back soon!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Melissa B.,"Knoxville, TN",2/10/2017,5.0,"Our son chose Balter Beerworks to celebrate his 21st birthday with family and a friend. It was the first visit for all of us. He heard from friends that it was great, and it did not disappoint! We all loved our meals and the beer selection had something for everyone. The food was fresh, beautiful presentation, delicious, perfect portions and prices are fair.  A beautiful sunset could be seen through the authentic garage doors of the former business of the property. It is definitely a millineal magnet. They welcome (but we wouldn't advise) young kids because they wouldn't enjoy it. We took our 12 year old and he enjoyed his meal but was pretty bored otherwise. Our only issue was the noise level (noise of the talking patrons, not the music or traffic or anything), but it was so loud that we almost had to shout to each other. We joked that we thought our ears would probably be ringing when we left as if we had been to a rock concert, but they weren't and we eventually got used to it. The staff was attentive, pleasant, efficient, helpful, neat in appearance and knowledgeable. Highly recommend! (Not sure how to give 4 1/2 stars the noise level being the only issue."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Patrick J.,"Chula Vista, CA",1/28/2017,5.0,Fish and chips I personally think is the best meal on the menu. They have a good selection of house beer.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Don I.,"Clinton, TN",12/19/2016,5.0,"If you are thirsty and hungry and in Knoxville, TN go to the Balter Beerworks. For some very good beer and a double cheeseburger that was out of this world. And the industrial atmosphere make for a good night out. Or just lunch."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Joe H.,"Knoxville, TN",12/19/2016,5.0,"I love this place. Great beers and great food. They're a brewery and I've not had a bad beer, though my favorite is the May Pop.  My go-tos for food are the Jackson Ave Salad or the Fish and Chips, though they also have cheap and good tacos during happy hour. The outside area is a good place to spend an evening in the summer and fall."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kristin R.,"Knoxville, TN",5/13/2016,3.0,"I really expected more. The Coffee Porter is viscous, creamy, and complex in flavor. I enjoyed that but was disappointed with our food. The caramelized Brussel sprouts were very sweet. Sickeningly sweet. When we inquired about the sweetness, our server informed me that it was maple syrup or something similar. We also ordered the fish tacos and potato chip nachos. Beer was good, food was ok. Maybe would try it again."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Kris K.,"Bridgman, MI",5/8/2016,5.0,"I loved this place. The BF and I stopped here upon recommendation of a friend and had a languid lunch on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Sat outside, watching the world go by. I loved my fried green tomato shrimp benedict on a BISCUIT. Yum. The beer was good, too. Friendly service, southern hospitality. We didn't even get to the cold salad bar inside. I'm sure it was good, too, but being outside and just enjoying a pint and the day and the food was sheer perfection."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Mark K.,"Tucson, AZ",4/16/2016,4.0,"nice atmosphere, good beer. Plenty of nice outdoor seating and friendly fast service. good burger, recommend the cheese grits side. The food was overly salty to my taste overriding the other flavors, solved by having another Firebelly IPA."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Matt R.,"Cincinnati, OH",10/14/2016,5.0,"I wish I had a 6th star. We walked in and had an amazing server, Stephanie. The owner even came up and talked to us making sure we were well taken care of. Beer selection is great, the food was incredible. We're only in town this weekend but if I come back this will be my first stop. Overall, hands down, incredible!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Lauren F.,"Knoxville, TN",3/5/2016,5.0,I work right across the street so have been here quite a few times since it's opening. I couldn't imagine having a better neighborhood restaurant/beer spot! The bear blend is my favorite beer I've tried so far. Love the black bean burger and blackened fish tacos. The nachos are a great sharing item and the beer cheese soup is an amaaazing guilty pleasure! The GM is extremely kind and every server I've had has been great and attentive.
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Andrew O.,"New York, NY",4/16/2016,5.0,"Great new local spot. Really good burger and good local beer. Also had the potato chip nachos, which were great. Glad to make this a new regular spot."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,George K.,"Knoxville, TN",3/2/2016,5.0,"Great menu to accompany first class beer. My partner and I have visited the place four times and actually got in the door three times. This place really is fun to visit and I think the word has gotten out. Not a typical pub menu. They have managed to find something for everyone on their menu. Their potato chip nachos are spectacular. The main menu has a number of items that will cater to every taste, including folks with gluten intolerance. Not surprisingly the beers are great. Quite a selection. Hard to imagine that a beer lover couldn't find more than one that he or she would like to try again. Weekends really jump and one might have to think ahead and perhaps wait a little while."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Bubba P.,"Knoxville, TN",2/25/2016,5.0,"This place exceeded our expectations. The food, beer, service and atmosphere were on point. Cheese grits rocked!!  Enjoyed the beer flight too. We'll be back."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Tim P.,"Knoxville, TN",9/9/2016,4.0,"I love this place. Blackened fish tacos are the best. Very busy, but worth the wait, service was a little slow, maybe understaffed. We saw our waiter a lot, but he seldom made eye contact or checked on us."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Susan S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/18/2016,5.0,"I love the look and location of Balter Beerworks.  On our first visit we tried tacos, burgers and fish, and everyone loved their food.  The portion size was good and the flavors were great.  They even had pickled vegetables with my tacos that really enhanced the meal.  The service was wonderful.  Our server was very patient with all of our questions and able to answer everything from food choices and what types of beer they brewed.  She introduced us to the ""flight"" of beers that was a hit.  We plan to return there soon."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,David B.,"Knoxville, TN",3/21/2016,3.0,"Extremely cool atmosphere and setup. I only came in to grab some beers but I've heard the food is good. Was pretty disappointed with the beer however. Quality was better than say DTGB but not on par with other local craft breweries. Only had like 9 beers total on tap and only 3 of them were from there. I get how it's hard to keep up with demand, especially as a new business. I'll give it another go in a couple months to see if they improve quality/selection but as of now if you're wanting to get a beer I'd rather go to Suttrees or Crafty Bastard."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Hana R.,"Knoxville, TN",4/16/2016,4.0,"Super-impressed! Several steps up from a typical Brewpub. I went for brunch and was surprised that the menu offered a variety of dishes that were unique while still maintaining the status of ""comfort food.""  I got the Fried Green Tomato Egg Benedict and it hit the spot! The beer was awesome, especially loved the porter using local 3Bears coffee.  Oh, and $1 Mimosas never hurt either.   The atmosphere here is also great, with a large space and just enough noise to cover the sounds of loud children...something that I always take into consideration for a return visit with kids.  The little buffet with assorted salads, muffins and cookies is also ideal for keeping kiddos satisfied if you had to wait for a table, although we sat immediately.  Service was great too. Will be returning!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of parking....the lot is small, but the restaurant seems like it can accommodate more people than the parking situation can.  So don't let a jam-packed lot deter you. We just parked at the bottom of the hill and walked up."
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Andrew J.,"Knoxville, TN",2/19/2016,5.0,"I went there on a day I wasn't eating meat. I know, probably not a smart move going to a brewpub for that. But I was kind of blown away with what I ordered. The veggie burger was one of the best I've ever had. Seriously, I didn't miss a real hamburger. The fried green tomatoes were also amazing. My kids' meals were also very good. You never expect those to be good but the kids mac n' cheese was excellent, and the chicken fingers were straight from the adult menu - just less of them. Cocktails were very good, and I can't wait to go back and try some meat and beer!"
balter-beerworks-knoxville,Loretta H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/29/2017,1.0,"Once a month, on the Friday after payday, a group of us go out for munchies and drinks. We have anywhere from 5 to 20 people. As Balter is one of my favorite places, and I organize the outings, I picked it for August's event. We had 19 people show up at various times starting at 3:15 pm. I have no idea what happened. I was the 5th person to arrive and it took a 1/2 hr. to get my drink, no less the 3 quesso dips and chipsI ordered for the table. Food came out indiscriminately and often was not what was ordered. People had to go to the bar to get their drinks because the wait was so long. We were the only table with people in the dining area, yet it was mass confusion with our waiter disappearing intermittently. He said he was trying. People who asked for water didn't get it. Someone wanted ketchup, I went and got it for them. One of our group never got their order at all. This is a great place for brunch, or lunch or dinner. The food is good. But do not bring a group for happy hour. I was totally embarrassed. Needless to say I will never bring the group there again."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,David M.,"San Francisco, CA",9/6/2022,5.0,"We stopped there this evening,  as it was a new place on the radar.   GREAT choice!    The food was excellent and generous.   The ingredients were top notch, and prepared very well.    I especially recommend the chips and Salsa...both are unique recipies,  and,  VERY good.  The Salsa is moderately spicy, but, my wife, who normally prefers mild   found it quite good and not too hot at all.The service was top notch too.  Our server did a great job.  She was personable and friendly,  as well as attentive.   When our glasses were reaching half empty,  she was right there to top them off.   I dropped a knife, and she arrived to collect it before I had picked it up off the floor.   To top it all off, the prices are very moderate...and so dinner here  was less expensive than it would have been at quite a number of less excellent restaurants.    I strongly recommend Emma's for an excellent meal."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Boy H.,"Knoxville, TN",5/20/2022,3.0,"I'll start with the highs. Very nice outside ambiance--when they are not creating a smokefest by burning fallen leaves and other debris in their outdoor fire pit. (BTW, we left, choosing to eat in a more healthy environment that day).  So, this review covers multiple dine-in experiences.  We Really want to like this place with it's nice outside, convenient location, and easy in and out. I must say, they serve up some of the best fries in town (when they haven't sat under the heat lamp) and the portion size is generous.  Hint: Ask for them fresh out of the fryer.  Ok, so why the 3 stars you ask?  Well, those are the best (possibly only) great things I can say about this place. In my experience, after multiple visits, the burgers are not noteworthy for flavor; they are as if pre-formed and lacking anything resembling of quality. Reminds me of the Schwann's truck food of yesteryear.  Definitely not smash burgers.  The buns are actually pretty good! But, they wa-aaay outsize the meat in the sandwich, so your essentially eating a bun sandwich, i.e., with a little meat. (Hint: I've found throwing the bottom bun away to be helpful, I'd recommend either larger meat portions, or using smaller buns that match the amount of meat).  Same experience with the chicken sandwich (actually worse). The ""Texas Bird"" sandwich (of chicken breast) was every bit of 1/4"" thick in most places with one small area (a couple of bites) that were about 3/8"" thick maybe.  I recommend it be renamed the ""Texas Hummingbird"" sandwich. If I had to guess, I'd say it weighed about 3oz.  It too seemed to be a prefabbed piece of meat. The taco salad was actually pretty good!  And, generous serving-size.  The meat was very well seasoned/flavored.  The pinto beans were cooked to perfection and the lettuce seemed fresh.  Kudos!    However, it arrived to us minus two essential ingredients--the dressing and the salsa. ???  We had to remind the wait-staff to get those items for us. . Not the first time... During a previous visit, I asked for some salt for my fries, hoping to get it before my fries got cold.  After waiting several minutes, I went inside to get it myself.  The wait staff was standing there texting on personal phone.  Finally, during this visit, my beer was served to me warm!  I'm not talking not properly chilled... by warm, I mean WARM!  In fairness, my wife's beer was ""cool""... not cold mind you, but at least not warm. This review illustrates examples based on several visits.  We so much want to like this place that we keep giving them 2nd, 3rd and 4th, etc. chances... each time expanding the length of time between visits.  Unfortunately, Emma's is inconsistent in quality of service and serving mediocre food."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Catrina B.,"Farragut, TN",5/17/2022,5.0,"WOW.. this place is da bomb... we enjoyed everything about Emma's from the parking lot to the dinning room. What a great place. And when I say great like give me a 6! The menu is perfect not to overwhelming and great variety of choices. Kids menu.. family friendly, welcoming atmosphere. The decor is really neat. Check out the bathrooms that are nice and clean. They have indoor, outdoor door covered and patio seating available. Take your pick. Our server was fun and knowledgeable. He was very attentive. You can tell all the employees like being there. Smiles everywhere. I had Charleston fried shrimp... and being from Charleston I know how it should look and taste.. SPOT ON. Well done Emma's, we'll done! No disappointments here. 5 star all the way."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Janet G.,"Morristown, TN",11/20/2021,5.0,"We were in the area and decided to give this place a try.  There was seating outside in a cool patio area and also in the plastic enclosed front porch.  We chose to eat inside.  Even though it was a Saturday at lunch time we were seated immediately.Our server took our drink orders and gave us a menu full of a diverse variety of food.  We chose the Chopped Steak with mashed potatoes, which we split.  We chose the collard greens as the additional side.  It came with one biscuit and we ordered an extra one for $1 more.We both ordered unsweetened tea and it was very good.  Our meal was delicious.  The steak came topped with gravy, mushrooms and sautéed onions.  The mashed potatoes tasted homemade.  The bowl of collards was fresh and seasoned great. If we're in the area again we'll definitely return.  Service was great in spite of it being very busy."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Colby M.,"Knoxville, TN",5/5/2022,5.0,OMG  this place was amazing! Really the best kept secret in Knoxville.Where do I start. This place was just spectacular from the way it was decorated to the service that you got was soon as you walked in the door. The waitress was amazing she really new the menu and very attentive. Also they have a live band that plays outside and it was great to sit there and listen to music and eat our food but also really nice that it wasn't so loud that you could still hear each other talk across the table. I think everybody should try this restaurant. yummy
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Lindsay H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/21/2021,5.0,"Whoaaaa nelly, this place is great. I don't know who Emma is, but she is setting the bar high for southern grub. Hubby and I actually stopped here on a whim and were seated right away. There is an enclosed/covered patio and a larger, open air patio (which looks super cool!), in addition to eclectically- decorated inside seating. All of the workers were extremely friendly and willing to stop by and chat when we had questions. You are able to peak into the kitchen and see them hard at work making the yummy food. I pondered a salad for a hot minute and decided that I can't go to a southern place and NOT try something fried. Chicken fried chicken seemed to fit the bill and it was a great choice! The breading had a slight kick and the gravy was hot and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were all you hope and dream of and I was delighted with the brussel sprouts with a balsamic glaze of some kind. I would like to bring a gallon of that glaze home and douse every meal with it. My husband got the same meal with collard greens instead of sprouts and they were really tender and full of flavor. They initially forgot his biscuit but promptly brought a whole basket of them before hubby cried in a corner over his loss. The service was great and a team effort. The owner stopped over, as did the manager, and yet it never felt forced or crossed the boundary into ""too much/invasive"" territory. Can't wait to go back. Hope to plan something for the Elite crew on the patio here."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Ikhlas S.,"Knoxville, TN",8/29/2022,4.0,"Everything I've eaten here is amazing except the taco salad. The parking situation is a little funky and can be frustrating, and the food is a little pricey. On the bright side, the portions are massive. I usually get a burger or fish & chips. I really like their fried mushrooms and fried pickles (you can get both half and half). Emma's hands down has the best burgers in Knoxville."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Leigh H.,"Dothan, AL",8/11/2022,5.0,"This place is a true GEM! Super awesome wonderful stupendous wait staff and great drinks, food and ambiance. We had half mushroom half fried pickles as appetizer--so yummy! Great beer and cocktail selection."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Heidi R.,"Chicago, IL",7/3/2022,5.0,"Our go to place for a great burger or a giant salad. Everything at Emma's is great. Burgers, Tacos, salads, etc. You literally can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Service is always top notch."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Greg W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/18/2021,5.0,"Emma's Southern Kitchen is a gem of a place to eat. And I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good scratch made food. We arrived before the dinner crowd, were promptly seated and served drinks. Yes the tea is sweet, just the right amount as well.We ordered the fish and chips and the fried shrimp. Subbed out the fries with the shrimp for potato salad and the coleslaw on the fish and chips for fried okra. Let me say, my grandma would have been proud of the okra. Everything was hot and tasty. But for me the okra stole the show.We are definitely returning to try more of the menu.My only suggestion would be to drop the southern from the name and just leave it at Emma's Kitchen. Having only a few southern dishes on the menu it could just as easily been called a Cantina with all of the Mexican dishes on the menu.Good Job Emma's!"
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Lisa C.,"Dallas, TX",2/21/2022,4.0,Small restaurant with welcoming atmosphere. Enjoyed their fried fish & chips. Fish had a bit of a water-logged texture but was light with crispy breading. Wish there had been more options for sides and fries were crispier but that's more of a preference thing than an indictment on them. Would totally consider a repeat visit.
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Hannah L.,"Nikiski, AK",6/24/2022,5.0,"We are here before checking in to our hotel about ten minutes away. It was less than an hour before closing, but service was still good. The fried mushrooms were great, as was the dipping sauce. We ordered shrimp tacos, chicken tenders, fish & chips, and a grilled cheese. The tacos were a bit spicy, but still wonderful. My kids loved the bell on the way out."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Jared M.,"Madison, AL",11/16/2021,4.0,"Limited experience - sat out front so didn't even make it through the front door - but it was all good. Good, patient service - we were having a lunch meeting.  Never felt rushed.  And my fried fish sandwich was yummy - the jalapeños are a nice touch. My pinto beans were not good - not a lot of flavor and not well-cooked enough. But my boss said his black & bleu burger and brussel sprouts were amazing. He ordered better. Looking forward to another visit and sampling more menu items."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Brandon M.,"Phoenix, AZ",7/13/2021,5.0,Southern hospitality at its finest! I was blown away by the service and the speed of this place. I ordered and had my food in front of me within five minutes. My server Bryson was very attentive. If you are ever in the Knoxville area I HIGHLY recommend coming here.
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Jack D.,"TN, TN",6/9/2022,4.0,"Emma's Southern Kitchen is the kind of place you only hear of by ear. The $2 margs ALL DAY EVERYDAY were the hook line and sinker for me, however, to only credit them as drinking spot is an immaculate mistake. There were many questions going in (besides how inconsolably drunk I would be) but since my first visit I've been frequent. Each time I've felt as tho I was the only customer that mattered. Eddie is extremely customer oriented and is willing to adjust the menu to however creative your stomach gets! I would suggest marrying the fried pickles & mushrooms as an appetizer. As we move on to the bulkier side of the menu, keep all hands and feet inside because it's a roller coaster. A southern kitchen that sells everything from chicken fried chicken, to Charleston shrimp and beef tacos. The portions could even feed Joey Chesnut on his best day! I so so wish that Mac n cheese was an option on the menu. I would suggest even offering a shrimp and mac n cheese combo similar to what is offered at Ruth Chris's. I'll have to remember to go on a night with live music!... 7.8/10"
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Hope H.,"Toccoa, GA",2/13/2021,5.0,"If you get the chance to eat here...go! Run, don't walk, you cannot go wrong.We had the blackened shrimp appetizer to start. Not only was the shrimp perfect but it's served with a unique sauce, almost like a Buffalo tartar. So good!We all ordered something different and it's really one of those places I wish I had more room. My son had the beef tacos with cinnamon apples and finished with banana pudding. And when your surly teenager approves and asks can we go back, you know it's a win.My daughter had country fried chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans. And then she finished by eating half my cheesecake.And I had the special of the night - ribs with a house salad and hand cut fries. I couldn't finish it all. But hands down, best ribs ever! Perfectly cooked, falling off the bones with a wonderful bbq sauce.Seriously can't say enough good things about the food. And it was made even better by super attentive service. Truly a solid team. Our drinks were never empty. We never had to look around for service. But they were respectful of our conversation as well (so not annoying at all.)Absolutely loved this dining experience.

emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Alejandra L.,"Fort Worth, TX",7/20/2021,5.0,This place has a really good selection of food. From bomb salads to burgers and of course southern comfort favorites. They have an outside patio and inside seating. We had salads and they were all very filling and flavorful. The Dalsamica salad was good but next time I would ask to go light on the dressing. The blackened chicken on it was just the cherry on top and it really made the whole dish. The  taco salad and the big Cesar salad with blackened chicken were great too! Definitely give this place a shot. Great food and nice staff.
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Dawn L.,"Summerville, SC",6/29/2021,5.0,"Great food! This is the same as ""The Burger""!They changed their name during COVID. Don't miss this one! Sorry no pics bc we ate it all so fast. I had a fish sandwich best ever."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Hal F.,"Knoxville, TN",1/18/2022,5.0,Southern done right. Tacos if you want some. Charleston shrimp are the best I've had. Friendly and helpful staff.
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Heather R.,"Knoxville, TN",12/5/2021,4.0,This place is a local gem. It has been in operation under a few names and menus with the same owner. The food is greatopl and the people are better. They have something to make everyone happy.
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Mary K.,"Ultimo, Australia",12/9/2021,5.0,"One of the best places to eat a burger in Knoxville. All the food is amazing and the staff is even better! We had a very large group and got our food quick. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. We had a great experience and will be back!! We recommend: AM burger, French dip, fries, shrimp tacos, and Brussels sprouts!!"

emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Alex G.,"Knoxville, TN",11/12/2021,5.0,"Our group of 4 men were searching for ""The Burgers"" and discovered that it is actually ""Emma's Southern Kitchen.""  But the expected outcome was still the same - very good.  I enjoyed the ""Chicken Fried Chicken"" meal with the tomato & cucumber salad as my additional side.  I felt the chicken was cooked well and the gravy with biscuit met my expectations.  The Tomato & Cucumber Salad was very good with olives, blue cheese, and onions also within the salad.  The other people ordered the Shrimp Tacos, and two burgers - and all said that they enjoyed their meal.  One person who wanted fries with his people had his plate overflowing with fries - which meant some of us got to eat some of his fries, too.  Nice.  The only downside is that we ordered the Chips & Salsa and thought that they were pretty standard fare.  When we went (11/11/21,) it was only half busy so service was very good.  It was intermittently raining so we dined inside and while a little cramped inside, it was fine.  I definitely will come back to try other meals and the price was fair and reasonable.  I am also interested in trying that outdoor patio next door so that we can enjoy our Tennessee weather while having a great meal with a good beer."

emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Chris O.,"Knoxville, TN",6/19/2020,5.0,"Yaaaaas!!! Thrilled to have this place in the neighborhood. Great food and awesome patio! Can't beat cheap margaritas. And it's not the super soury mix kind. I wish I could have enjoyed several of these, but I was there with the kids. Speaking of kids, the patio was spacious and perfect for our loud family. It was a gorgeous night so we didn't need it, but they have an A/C unit out there. And it's dog friendly - dog bowls were set out for the furry guests. Made me wish I had one to bring along! Live music was setting up in the corner while we were there.Food: we did the ribs (they aren't on the menu: they do this to make sure that they are good everytime - sometimes bbq isn't as good when it's cooked in high demand) and chop steak. Both excellent. Chop Steak was kind of like a loco moco. We both did okra on the side and I dare to say it's better than Gus's. We ordered a grilled cheese for the little guy with a side of green beans and I couldn't stop stealing them - they were blistered and delicious. For dessert we did the banana pudding - they put chocolate sauce inside which is an interesting twist but worked! Will try the chocolate cake next time. Service: Brittany was a sweetheart and super attentive. I get nervous when orders aren't written down but she didn't need to - she remembered everything and it came out perfectly. We had a great experience and can't wait to come back. Hoping this place sticks around!!"

The beer is ice cold, the service is super friendly, and the food is out of this world. Don't get me wrong, it's not healthy, not even close. That's not why you go to Emma's kitchen. You go to Emma's kitchen to get the best french fries and burgers and fried fish and all the southern fixings that make you feel great in your belly and guilty in your heart. And it will not disappoint, not in the slightest. Order the mushroom burger and thank yourself later."

emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Colby H.,"Cookeville, TN",2/28/2022,4.0,"My only knock would be the quality of  my food. Started with biscuit and gravy as a starter, mainly just because it was in that section of the menu. Gravy was heavily salted. As one who struggles to make gravy with a consistent flavor at home, I understand the struggle, however the salt in this particular batch was overpowering. I had their version of bam bam shrimp tacos as my main course. I get a version of these at Misfit tacos in Cleveland, TN and they are hands down the best I've ever had. That being said, the Bam shrimp tacos here are not on the same level. The shrimp itself was not as flavorful, the amount of tomatoes on these particular tacos made it difficult to taste anything else, and the sauce had a good kick but was lacking in flavor. Overall, the experience was good with no complaints from a service or pricing standpoint. If only the food quality had been better this place would be 5 of 5."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Tori B.,"Maiden, NC",8/24/2021,5.0,Best restaurant in Knoxville in my opinion. The food has always been great with very large portions. The  prices are very fair for the taste and size of their meals and their drink specials are great as well. Their service is incredibly friendly and on top of it. I have been here at least 10 different times ranging from months apart to weeks apart and I have yet to be even slightly disappointed by them. The only bad thing is that I am usually to full to order desert so I haven't had the chance to try their deserts yet. Maybe one day!
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Amye E.,"Corryton, TN",5/19/2020,5.0,"This place is HEAVEN! The food was amazing, the patio is gorgeous and the service was great!

emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Barbara C.,"Powell, TN",7/30/2020,4.0,"I'm not sure why I haven't tried this place yet, but I was in the area the other day and decided to stop and grab a bite for lunch.  I was immediately greatly by a friendly face, with a personality to match. Since it was my first time, I asked for recommendations and To which I wasn't steered wrong. I was worried due to me being on a time crunch that I might not be able to enjoy my food in house, but my food surprisingly came flying out the fryer faster than I expected.  The fish and chips were pretty good. I didn't care too much for the slaw, as it had a tad bit too much mayo for my liking, but that's just my personal preference. Anyway, overall it was a great experience and I look forward to coming back and trying more of their menu."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Brooke D.,"Dallas, TX",11/12/2020,5.0,"Very good lunch spot! Great outdoor atmosphere. My husband had fish tacos, I had grilled shrimp salad. Also very fresh salsa with chips. Would highly recommend!"

emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Jennifer S.,"Bakersfield, CA",7/7/2020,5.0,"I've been spoiled with EXCELLENT quality food from the west coast and recently moved to Knoxville and unfortunately Knoxville is a downgrade on the food scale. We have been trying to find a good/decent place to eat and have been disappointed everytime until we stopped here. This restaurant has EXCELLENT food! We were satisfied with everything! The burger was exceptional, collard greens were yummy, my kids and I loved the fried okra, and the homemade biscuits were just a great touch. I normally don't leave reviews, but being disappointed so many times with the food in Knoxville and then being blown away by this place I just felt the urge to write one. It reminded me of being back west and paying for an actually good quality meal!"
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,David M.,"Merritt Island, FL",10/14/2020,5.0,"The food here is so so good!  You have to have the big basket of fried mushrooms.  My husband and I split the Chicken Fried Chicken with the sausage gravy, mashed potatoes and green beans, along with the biscuit.  So glad we shared this meal.  Again it was awesome!"
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Amy T.,"Tempe, AZ",10/10/2020,5.0,"Found this place on our way from Louisville, KY to Asheville, NC and thought why not. Once parked the smells, despite the rain, smelled amazing. Once sat had the nicest waiter, who for the life of me can't remember his name. Very personable guy who took an interest in our cross country traveling adventure. The food was good just so much and hard to finish. If anyone ever in the area would recommend stopping by this place."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Al J.,"Knoxville, TN",5/16/2020,4.0,"Essentially the same as The Burgers (same location, menu, owner) but new name. The fish & chips and fish sandwich are terrific! The chicken fried chicken was good but not outstanding...not crazy about the biscuit...sides were good choices. WAITRESS NEVER EVEN MENTIONED THE RIBS!  We saw the big smoker at the street, but they weren't on the menu or separate handout. Looked great...big half-rack with 2 sides for $18 . Aside from that, service was very good."

emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Brian B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/4/2020,5.0,"We decided to go out and eat for dinner tonight, and wanted something local so we decided on The Burgers. After pulling in and realizing it's now Emma's we decided to go in and give it a try. I had the fish and chips and it was delicious. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere I can't wait to go back and have it again. Thanks"
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Kim M.,"Paris, France",8/15/2020,5.0,"My daughter's and I stopped in today for lunch... our first time at this restaurant. Service was friendly and our food came out very fast.  I got the fish sandwich,  my daughters had a burger and wings.  I ordered the cucumber and tomato salad with my fish sandwich... both were excellent. Generous portion of fries with the burger that we all shared. Very happy we decided to check this place out today and we can't wait to come back."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,A B.,"Clifton, VA",11/21/2020,4.0,Friendly and welcoming atmosphere and will definitely return next time we're in Knoxville. The fried pickles are delicious and a large portion - plenty to share! If sitting outside dress warm - they have a great fire pit but  could use some freestanding space heaters.  Salads are filling and burgers/fries tasty and well portioned. Relatively simple menu but they do it well.  Happy Hour margaritas are ok.  Parking can be challenging but lots of room behind the restaurant.
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,S F.,"Gallatin, TN",9/15/2020,5.0,"Top notch service and food.  I travel for business and I have eat out a lot, so quality matters to me.  I eat at Emma's every time I'm in Knox."
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Jo W.,"Knoxville, TN",9/19/2020,4.0,I like this place. Fried mushrooms are so good.  Ribs are super good!! Live music on weekends & maybe Thursdays nit sure but it's good too! Fast service Love the history of how it got its name!!!  Highly recommend!
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Gianna L.,"Cleveland, TN",9/18/2020,2.0,"I got the fish tacos. It was like fish nuggets, mostly breading and not a lot of fish. The tacos themselves had more sauce and garnish than the meat. I will not be coming back here"
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Tonya M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/13/2020,5.0,Found this hidden gem while looking for a place to eat on a not so good day. Emma's was definitely a bright spot. Food was delicious and service was friendly and attentive. They also had good team work with other servers stopping by to refill drinks and such. Something that I thought should be common but doesn't  seem to be. I was way too full for dessert but it did sound good maybe next time I will split food with someone and get dessert.
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Jarred M.,"Knoxville, TN",7/6/2020,5.0,I've been there a few times when it was known as The Burgers. Shout out to the owners for changing this location up and adding some new options to the menu. I had the fish tacos and they were delicious! They have the same fries they've always had which are also some of my favorite in Knoxville. If you haven't hit up Emma's then you should probably remedy that.
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,Taya W.,"San Francisco, CA",7/13/2020,1.0,None of the employees were wearing masks. I got heckled walking out of the restaurant for wearing my mask. I will never come back to this place again.
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,David R.,"Midlothian, VA",7/2/2020,5.0,Great burgers and exceptional service!  We were traveling and were hungry for a good burger and was not disappointed.  My wife and I appreciate a good bun and theirs seems to be homemade.  My son loved his chicken tenders and the fries were great.  Excellent service!  Our waiter was always available and refilled our drinks without needing to be asked.  Highly recommend!
emmas-southern-kitchen-knoxville,John M.,"Knoxville, TN",5/19/2020,5.0,Great food and service. I had chicken fried chicken and wife had Cuban. Called ahead for takeout. It was ready promptly.
southern-grit-knoxville,Thuy Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",8/3/2022,5.0,"This is one of my favorite spots in  Knoxville!It's not a super big restaurant but not super cramped- open and spaced well. I've never had to wait for a table and they also accept reservations. A focused menu with elevated southern staples gives a nice variety to sample--but be warned, the best things on the menu are not god for you.Love the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese, a win because I don't like tomatoes or pimento cheese...it's tangy, savory and a little sweet with the honey. Don't save these as leftovers, they'll get soggy and won't last.Fried pickles and okra as a starter is a great portion size for the price.Husband loved the meatloaf, I love the fried shrimp platter with  collard greens. We've also had burgers and crab cake sandwich which ended up being really hard to eat/messy and just fine. Fried chicken is also good and the cocktails are yummy!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Angie W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2022,2.0,"Meeting some friends in Knox and had been wanting to try Southern Grit.  Called up and was able to get a reservation for a Sunday.  There is free parking just down from the restaurant so that was great.  Got there and immediately seated.  Our waitress was sweet as pie, but took her forever to get to us.  Two tables sat after us got attention before we did.  Not her fault that either a) short staffed or b) someone sat her too fast.  Food was a mixed bag.  Pimento appetizer was awesome.  Chicken was pretty bland and dry.  Two different levels of heat and two different chicken orders and neither had any flavor.  Pass on the salad as just a bowl of greens with not much excitement.  Everyone has a preference for biscuits and what they should consist of.  Theirs just didn't hit it out of the park for us.  Just okay. Bloody Mary's were pretty basic but for $5 that's okay.  Kind of sad as we love southern food and love this area of Knox.  Think maybe another chance will be given for dinner before we take them off the list."
southern-grit-knoxville,Michael Y.,"San Francisco, CA",8/9/2022,4.0,"A little bit removed from the central square, but worth the short walk. The chicken was excellent, as was the fried okra. I also had a side of hush puppies which were quite good also. I had leftover hush puppies for breakfast. The biscuit was not good and should be improved (no real excuse for a bad biscuit in Tennessee). Really good selection of draft beers. It is quite (understandably) popular."
southern-grit-knoxville,Shana L.,"Knoxville, TN",8/13/2022,5.0,"This restaurant is conveniently located in the Old City. This place stays crowed so reservations are a good idea in order to get in. Our server Emily was awesome! Emily was very helpful explaining the menu. I picked the fried chicken, Brussel sprouts, and fried okra. The food was exceptional and fresh. Great southern food to the heart. I will definitely return!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Shana L.,"Knoxville, TN",3/16/2022,5.0,"This was my first time eating at Southern Grit and it was phenomenal experience. We went during lunch and was seated immediately. I had the crab cakes with special sauce, sweet potato fries, and creamed collards. Biscuits are to die for! The food was hot and cooked to order. I had chance to taste the shrimp and grits, meatloaf, and chicken pot pie. I had no complaints about any of the food. I look forward to returning to taste other food on the menu."
southern-grit-knoxville,Sarah M.,"Memphis, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,"Great list of options for brunch and dinner. Definitely need to check it out, usually a wait but worth it."
southern-grit-knoxville,Janet C.,"Cornwall, CT",8/29/2022,4.0,"My bestie and I were on a road trip, stayed at a nearby Air B&B.  Had dinner at the bar, fried chicken, which was terrific, fried Brussels sprouts that were a wee bit too fried and a side salad, which was good!  Amazing glass of Viognier made the meal complete!   Terrific service from the bartender too!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Joanie L.,"Boston, MA",6/10/2022,4.0,"We got here just in time to order before the kitchen closed (9:30 on a Sat for 10PM closing, things run early in Knoxville). Split the gumbo which was huge and delicious for about $20 and a side of Brussels sprouts slaw. Kind of a sports bar oriented place but lots of good sounding items on the menu and nice service."
southern-grit-knoxville,Thomas B.,"Grand Blanc, MI",5/17/2022,5.0,"Great food received tonight by my friend and I while visiting downtown Knoxville.Courteous, efficient, and friendly service was provided by Isaiah.  We also enjoyed engaging him in pleasant conversation.We tried a few different sliders as well as Jambalaya for an entrée.  All items as well as the banana pudding for dessert were great.  We both agree , we would return another time to enjoy this place...."
southern-grit-knoxville,Bao N.,"San Jose, CA",5/14/2022,2.0,"I ordered two entrees, because I was hungry. What a mistake. For the sides, I got fried okra, mac and cheese, cheesy grits, and creamy collard greens. The mac and cheese had no salt or flavor. The fried okra was oversalted. Creamy collards were very sour (but maybe thats how they should be? apologies if Im just an uncultured charlaton) and did not go well with the proteins. Cheesey grits were fine. Now the fried chicken, it was sooo salty my tongue was hurting, similar to how you eat too much pineapple and wake up with regrets. you know what im talking about... The meatloaf was decent."
southern-grit-knoxville,Leah L.,"Mooresville, NC",8/14/2022,3.0,"I'm giving a 3 because it was ok. I loved the Crab Cakes, Mashed Potatoes. My son didn't like the Meatloaf but did like the Max and Cheese. My husband liked the grits and none of us liked the Hushpuppies, but the butter that comes with them is good on the biscuit. The biscuits aren't a typical southern biscuit, it has a yeast feel and look to it. Service was just ok. We had to ask for a to go container and our check at the bar and then had to take the check and card up to her, no she wasn't the bartender. Since my son is moving here for school we'll be in the area a lot and we'll try it again."
southern-grit-knoxville,Karmen B.,"Farragut, TN",4/26/2022,5.0,"This will be a place I go to again and again. The food was great, but I cannot get over the portion of the appetizer( fried pickles and okra). It was a lot for $12. I ended up splitting the app and the chicken plate with my boyfriend. $14 for the meal which in todays times with inflation I thought was great. 2 pieces of chicken, 2 sides and a biscuit. Chicken was great. Mashed potato's were good, but nothing special. Mac and cheese was different but in a good way! The biscuit was so soft. I also order a bowl of banana pudding. Pretty big sharing size bowl for $5. Just cant beat the quality food for the cheap price."
southern-grit-knoxville,Andrea C.,"Columbia, SC",8/18/2022,5.0,I was in town for a convention and saw the pictures of food online. The chicken pot pie was was not your typical chicken pot pie because it's not a pie. But it is so darn good! Every piece of chicken was moist and juicy. The broth was so flavorful. I wanted to lick the bowl. If you are visiting Knoxville please stop in and give Southern Grit a try.
southern-grit-knoxville,Angie H.,"Knoxville, TN",3/12/2022,5.0,"Great food. Zac was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. We got the hush puppies as appetizer. There were so many and they were served with honey butter. I got the shrimp and chips with Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese can be good or bad out, this was great.  Hubs got the 2 pc white with mashed potatoes and okra. Medium had enough heat to feel but not too hot. All of the sides were amazing. Only compliant - it was a little loud because of the ceiling. We will definitely go back."
southern-grit-knoxville,Jay B.,"Port Deposit, MD",6/20/2022,4.0,Great meal and great service. Shrimp and grips had just enough kick but not overpowering. We had chicken pot pie also. Had great flavor and packed with chicken. Great place to have dinner.
southern-grit-knoxville,Ashley B.,"Clinton, TN",6/11/2022,3.0,"So I went to southern grit today and it wasn't what I expected. I was expecting a mom and pop southern comfort restaurant. This is actually a restaurant and bar. Really more of a hang out for the college crowd. I did see all kinds there but primarily college students. As for the food...I ordered meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and creamed collard greens. Best I could tell the meat loaf was not home made, wasn't bad but not home made. Gravy for the mashed potatoes was thin and the flavor was way off. Collard were a little too bitter for my liking. The tea was good. The waitress was very accomodating."
southern-grit-knoxville,Anna S.,"IN, IN",4/1/2022,5.0,100% reccamend:-sweet potato fries are a dream omg-amazing location and aesthetically pleasing-mac n cheese is good-if you like seafood they have some of that too-nice service-good vibes all around
southern-grit-knoxville,Donald R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/16/2022,4.0,"This place lives up to its reputation as a great place for Southern, somewhat modern food.  The inside is modern, industrial, farmhouse.  The menu has an excellent variety.  The service was great.  We were seated immediately (on a Saturday night), and our server was very attentive throughout our meal.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed the fried chicken, creamy collards and grits, while I liked my shrimp and chips with Brussel slaw.  The slaw was unexpectedly good.  The shrimp were lightly battered, and I liked the string fries too.  It was all good, and we look forward to our return to try other items on their menu."
southern-grit-knoxville,Max Q.,"Scottsdale, AZ",6/24/2022,5.0,This was my first dinner in Knoxville and I am very happy I stumbled into this placeNice vibe. Not too busyThe 'guy burger ' was fantastic. Perfectly cookedThe fried Brussels sprouts super tasty.  Was tempted to order another portion. Highly recommended
southern-grit-knoxville,Brenda M.,"Arlington, VA",7/18/2022,5.0,Skip the food and just do the starters!!!!! The hot pimento and cheese dip with warm buttered crackers are to die for!  Just do it!!!

southern-grit-knoxville,Bethany F.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",7/5/2022,5.0,This place was full when we walked in but luckily we got two seats at the bar no problem! Some of the best fried chicken I've had and that's saying a lot because I grew up in the south! Service was great even at the bar. Great pre concert meal!
southern-grit-knoxville,John M.,"Maryville, TN",1/12/2022,4.0,This is sure to become one of our favorite places. We met and couple here for lunch. We started with the fried Brussels sprouts and hush puppies. Both were very good. I had the shrimp and chips with Brussels sprout slaw.  My wife ordered the fried chicken which she raved about.
southern-grit-knoxville,Adam F.,"Danbury, CT",6/26/2022,5.0,Wow. Everything was top notch here. The service. The biscuits. The chicken. The drink options. Definitely a must try.
southern-grit-knoxville,Amy B.,"Louisville, TN",5/31/2022,4.0,The service was quick and courteous. The many diverse and eclectic. Happy Hour was the perfect combination of fun choices and decent prices. Highly recommend. It was so nice to be back in the Old City.
southern-grit-knoxville,Lindsey S.,"FL, FL",3/9/2022,5.0,"Just moved to Knoxville and have been trying out the local places, not super impressed with most, until we tried Southern Grit. We were just walking around Old City and we had plenty of choices, looking at menus, the meatloaf struck my eye so we decided to circle back and try it out. Let me tell you, the BEST food we have had since we moved here! I, of course, got the meatloaf, and my boyfriend got the shrimp and grits, both were DELICIOUS - he almost licked his plate clean but I'm a small eater so I took the rest home and thoroughly enjoyed the leftovers later - We will definitely be back. Oh, and by the way, the sweet potato waffle fries are so light and airy, coated in sugar, it was like eating a sweet potato funnel cake, our server Casey recommended them and we were so glad he did. Can't wait to go back and try more."
southern-grit-knoxville,Macy D.,"TN, TN",1/10/2022,5.0,"My fiancé and I went here for brunch on Saturday to check out something new and different in the Old City. Woah- this place totally blew us away!!! We both raved about it afterward and have talked about it several times since. Their brunch menu is extensive and full of delicious comfort foods. We got the brussel sprouts (no joke- best I've EVER had), the crab artichoke dip (yummy..a little thin but with good flavors), and buffalo chicken dip (not too spicy but full of flavor!). Both dips were served with buttery baked saltines, which was a nice alternative to tortilla chips. We also split the Del Mar biscuit which was HUGE. My fiancé ate the bulk of it, and he cleaned his plate. We got a side of Mac and cheese which was the perfect, creamy, big noodled side I hoped it would be. We split a ""mimosa bottle"", which is literally a bottle of champagne served with a small carafe of juice of your choice which was exceptionally priced. We would've gotten more if brunch time hadn't ended (we were late to the game). All in all- it's our new fave brunch spot in town and we cannot wait to go back!!! Also special shout out to our server, Gracia, who was friendly, knew her stuff about the menu items, and was a wonderful server and a breath of fresh air compared to many servers we've experienced at other places over the past few months!!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Brian W.,"Yorkville, IL",2/10/2022,5.0,"We stopped in here for dinner when driving around town.  We had the crab and artichoke dip for an appetizer and even though they didn't have any artichoke right now, they more than made up for it.  It was wonderful, especially with buttered and fried saltines! True amazing!  We then had the chicken pot pie, the chicken and waffles and the fried chicken club sandwich.  I also had an old fashioned and they did a great job with that.  I ordered the waffles and chicken as Hot, and the ghost pepper jam that came with it delivered!  That was an amazing meal as the chicken was good sized and was already off the bone so ready to dig in.  Highly recommend stopping in here."
southern-grit-knoxville,Stewart S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/14/2022,3.0,We had heard of this place and on a whim decided to try it.  We were seated beside a window with a view of old city. I chose the medium hot fried chicken with okra.  The okra was standard breaded deep fried the chicken had nice flavor but was very greasy.  Carol had the Brussels Sprout salad which was fresh but raw sliced sprouts were a bit hard to eat.  Service was good.
southern-grit-knoxville,Claire H.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",5/23/2022,5.0,All of the food was excellent and the service was great. We got the pimento cheese dip and each got different entrees that were all very good.
southern-grit-knoxville,Tullahoma E.,"Murfreesboro, TN",10/4/2021,4.0,"Pretty good.Probably more of a college hangout than I was looking for. Pretty loud, but the food was very good & if I hadn't been toting kids along I would have sampled their impressive beer selection."
southern-grit-knoxville,Debbie H.,"Vista, CA",7/24/2022,5.0,"Delicious! Traditional southern with a modern twist. Their fried green tomatoes, chicken pot pie, and the meatloaf were all outstanding. Our server Katie was friendly and attentive."
southern-grit-knoxville,Jonathan G.,"Knoxville, TN",9/4/2021,5.0,"Excellent southern in a nice setting in old city.Broad menu with something for everyone ranging from salads, sandwiches and entrees.We had sandwiches with Brussels sprouts slaw...both were excellent..,Service is really nice as well.This is a new 'go to' restaurant for us and we will happily drive from west Knoxville to old city to eat there"
southern-grit-knoxville,Schauna G.,"Smyrna, GA",10/31/2021,5.0,"Great food, great service. I ordered the fruit as a side but I only wanted strawberries so the server picked the strawberries out for me. That is great service."
southern-grit-knoxville,China-Kat S.,"San Francisco, CA",9/10/2021,4.0,I very much enjoy this place! The staff was fairly happy (I say that because we went in a half hour before they closed) none the less it was a pleasant experience. I got the southern mess and boy was that good mess! The bacon jam is my jam for real  I'd definitely come back!
southern-grit-knoxville,Jay D.,"Baltimore, MD",5/17/2020,3.0,"This is a delayed review from before Covid. I heard some really great things about Southern Grit so I may have just ordered the wrong food, but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.I will say that the space is really cool - I love the giant windows, lighting, and wooden tables (I don't normally like sitting at those giant tables that they seat more than one party in, but this time it didn't feel so obtrusive and the table wasn't so wide that we couldn't have a conversation with the people across from us). The bar is really cute too, so whoever decorated did a great job. The staff was also friendly.For food, I got the Brussel sprouts to share as an appetizer, which was good, I just like my Brussel sprouts really crispy which wasn't the case here. For my entree I got the Chicken pot pie that honestly just didn't do it for me.. the chicken was dry, the vegetable stew/sauce didn't taste like anything - I think I've had tastier chicken pot pie from the frozen food section at the grocery store. The biscuit was good, but didn't make up for the rest of the food. My friend got the Brussel sprouts salad with fried chicken on top and wasn't enthralled either. She also thought the chicken was dry, the salad was fine but it's a salad... I can't remember what my two other friends got, I know they shared the Fried green tomatoes that they thought were ok but nothing special. I would go back just to sit at the bar and get a drink and some appetizers, but unfortunately I didn't love the food."
southern-grit-knoxville,Cindy L.,"Boca Raton, FL",8/11/2021,5.0,I lived in Knoxville for five years before this place opened and wish it had been around when I was there. I visited in January with a group of eight people and we had an amazing time. The cheeseburger with pimento cheese was out of this world and both service and atmosphere made for an excellent time. I can't wait to go back to Knoxville just so I can eat more of their delicious food.
southern-grit-knoxville,Bill S.,"Seagrove, NC",6/30/2022,5.0,"My wife and I were looking for some good southern cooking while staying in Knoxville and we found it at the Southern Grit. The service was great. We started with the fried green tomatoes (minus the pimento cheese) which were drizzled with hot honey. They were very good and came out freshly made from the kitchen. We also ordered some of the biscuits which came out with a side of pepper jelly and a side of honey butter. Not a fan of pepper jelly, but the butter was creamy and perfect. I had the Jambalaya pasta, while my wife ordered the chicken pot pie. The jambalaya pasta was a huge serving and very tasty. Just the right spices without being hot. My wife raved about the chicken pot pie. She said it was creamy and had great flavors. The truth about the chicken pot pie is it is really chicken and biscuits. So if you are looking for the traditional pot pie you may be disappointed but you won't be disappointed with the food."
southern-grit-knoxville,Jessica L.,"Philadelphia, PA",7/17/2021,5.0,Was passing through Knoxsville and I had been craving good southern food (grew up down south) and this place did not disappoint! The fried chicken was super crispy and they have AWESOME happy hour deals. Highly recommend !
southern-grit-knoxville,Samantha M.,"CONCORD FARR, TN",2/26/2022,5.0,Great! We were able to get in on a Sunday for brunch! The service was great as well as the food! We will be back!
southern-grit-knoxville,Dionne F.,"Knoxville, TN",2/24/2020,5.0,Southern Grit Charmed Restaurant has the best daily brunch menu. They serve a delicious oven baked chicken potpie with two perfect biscuits. My youngest loves their kids chicken tenders and specialty burgers. What really made our brunch super delightful was the made from scratch blueberry and peach cobblers with vanilla bean icecream. The entire restaurant and ladies powder room was spotless and fresh.
southern-grit-knoxville,Leslie S.,"Hendersonville, TN",1/16/2022,5.0,Delicious for brunch and they have a large drink variety from beer selections to great deals on bubbly! I will say you should definitely make a reservation with them but YUMMY brunch
southern-grit-knoxville,Shannon F.,"Monroe, OH",8/15/2021,4.0,"Biscuits were great starter! The honey butter was flavorful and perfect. My son got the jambalaya. Portion was not huge but was very good. His roommate got the Shrimp and Chips. Said it was the best shrimp he has ever had. My husband got the 1/2 chicken and said it was excellent. I got the PBLT. It does not look like the picture on Yelp, but it was so good! The homemade pimento cheese was the best I have ever had.Service was a bit spotty.Worth the visit!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Harvey G.,"Germantown, TN",11/10/2020,5.0,"Great chicken sandwich!  I ordered the spicy one and it didn't disappoint!  Racheal was my server and was very friendly, knowledgeable, and did her job very well!  She is an asset to Southern Grit, but I'm sure they already know that!  I will stop by for another visit when I'm in town again!  Fair prices and good quality"
southern-grit-knoxville,Ellie S.,"Asheville, NC",7/2/2021,5.0,This was the first place I visited in Knoxville. The cocktails were yummy and the food was delicious! Very cute atmosphere!
southern-grit-knoxville,T T.,"Seymour, TN",1/18/2022,3.0,"Stopped in for a quick bite, great atmosphere and super friendly staff! Sat at the bar and had happy hour sliders that were meh for the most part. Drink specials were for well brands only . Will try regular menu and update."
southern-grit-knoxville,Alice P.,"Edison, NJ",1/11/2022,5.0,Excellent food and the service was great. Server was patient and accommodating to our party with a busy two year old.
southern-grit-knoxville,Cassie R.,"Simpsonville, SC",4/29/2022,5.0,Good chicken and great service. We will go back for sure . Host was not very nice and seemed out off by the size of the group and slammed beer bottles in the trash can but the rest of the staff was great.
southern-grit-knoxville,Kara E.,"Knoxville, TN",12/10/2021,5.0,"Southern Grit has become one of our favorite places. Great food, drinks, service, and atmosphere!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Karyn F.,"Bronx, NY",6/17/2021,5.0,That chicken pot pie was absolutely amazing. Everything we ordered was delicious. The best meal I've had in Knoxville.
southern-grit-knoxville,Maddie B.,"TN, TN",12/11/2021,4.0,"So good! I went in a large group and the service was awesome. I loved the Pimento cheese and crab dip. My mahi mahi was ok, but the grilled Brussel sprouts are amazing!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Jenn W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2021,5.0,"We ate here a couple of weeks ago during the week.  The inside has a cool vibe, and our server was very friendly and helpful.  We started with the friend green tomato appetizer.  It was great, and I particularly loved that each slice had a little scoop of pimento cheese.  So good!  For our entrees, I had the shrimp and grits, and my husband had the jambalaya pasta.  Both were excellent!  We will definitely be back!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Madison P.,"Knoxville, TN",10/31/2021,5.0,"Nice place in old town to come and grab a drink. Great service, decor, and vast liquor selection to include local craft beers."
southern-grit-knoxville,Austin C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/6/2021,1.0,"Got an order to go for chicken and waffles. We were able to sit down at the bar while we waited for the food to come out. Took 10 minutes for the bartender to even acknowledge us. Seemed like a decent selection for food but a little pricey. The bartender called us idiots for ordering our food to go... really?! She was pretty rude to us and didn't say a word when she gave us the check, not even a thank you or have a good night. Got our food and took it home to eat. Tasted alright, but the waffles were spicy. Not the syrup or the chicken, but the waffles. Wasn't too much to handle or anything, I just certainly wasn't expecting to eat spicy waffles lol. There was something weird floating in the syrup. And it didn't taste that great. Won't be coming back"
southern-grit-knoxville,B D.,"Newark, IL",3/24/2021,5.0,Got right in and seated quickly with a table of five.Ordered the house version of an old fashioned... it was awesome. We ordered Jambalaya.. shrimp and grits... waffles and chicken... crab cakes.. and a crazy garbage type sandwich.Simply... we are going back again soon.
southern-grit-knoxville,La Toya W.,"North Palm Beach, FL",8/1/2021,5.0,"Yummy! Full bottle champagne w a mimosa order. I ordered the Pete, it was delicious. Boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. Chicken was a fried breast, small and not as flavorful as it looked. Waffle was perfection."
southern-grit-knoxville,Jiliana D.,"Boiling Springs, SC",7/24/2021,5.0,"Came here on a whim driving home from KY because of the Brussels sprouts on the menu. Ordered the fried chicken and it was so crispy and flavorful and juicy. The cheddar grits were really good, which I wasn't fully expecting. The grilled Brussels were decent but not my favorite. All in all, a pretty great meal."
southern-grit-knoxville,Dylan S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/17/2020,4.0,"Consistently good.  The crab cakes consist mainly of crab with little filler, and are topped with a tasty cream sauce.  Also tried the crab and artichoke dip this time around which was good. I still prefer the pimento cheese dip though."
southern-grit-knoxville,Dylan S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/21/2019,4.0,"Went on a Friday night.  There was no wait and service was great despite business picking up as we were ordering.  Cocktails and draft beer menu is somewhat small but offers some good and tasty options.  For An appetizer we ordered the pimento cheese dip which was pretty amazing.  It comes with a jelly so you get the sweet and savory thing going on.  Would definitely order that again.For entrees we ordered the Nashville hot (med) fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, fried okra, and the chicken pot pie.  The chicken flavor was really good with a low level of heat. My only problem with it was that there was a pretty large volume of oil puddling on my plate which soaked the biscuit and the bottom of the chicken.  The okra and Mac were legit, really liked them both.  The chicken pot pie is also really good. It comes with two biscuits on top rather than a pie crust topping.  Lastly we got the cobbler for dessert. I wanted to like it, but it was pretty underwhelming.  Presentation was not appetizing,  flavor was kind of bland, peaches seemed to be of the canned variety, and it was still cold in the center when served to us.  Unless they improve on this one I would skip it.All in all pretty good though! Good addition to old city."
southern-grit-knoxville,Blake W.,"Old City, Knoxville, TN",1/25/2020,4.0,"Definitely hit the spot! I had the 2-piece fried chicken (all white meat). I chose the ""medium"" spic batter, but if you typically like spicy food, I'd go with ""hot"". The chicken was fried and seasoned PERFECTLY! Had the Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes - I'd make the Mac and cheese a regular side selection, but the gravy for the mashed potatoes was  a little too heavy on the rosemary for my liking. Comes with a biscuit and WOW it was SO GOOD! Definitely a southern biscuit on all accounts. Overall, this is a great spot when you've got a comfort food craving - especially if you're looking for an elevated but simple meal. They have a great drink and dessert selection as well."
southern-grit-knoxville,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/14/2020,4.0,We came in for lunch and were able to sit right away. We did park in the paid lot adjacent to the restaurant. Service was attentive and our server Was very good at describing menu items and giving recommendations. We had fried green tomatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts as apps. Both were outstanding - super fresh and tasty. I ordered the meatloaf was full of flavor and tender. Hubs had the the best fried chicken he's ever had. This is a must try in Knoxville!
southern-grit-knoxville,Amanda W.,"Charleston, SC",2/20/2022,5.0,Food was fabulous! I had Fried Green Tomatoes for an appetizer! The Pimento cheese on the tomatoes was excellent! I shared chicken and waffles also and it was great! The pepper jelly was really good also. Prices were very reasonable.
southern-grit-knoxville,Morgan K.,"AL, AL",5/21/2021,5.0,"loved it! great environment and great food! the ""southern mess"" was a delicious sandwich as it had many flavors that went well together such as bacon jam, pimento cheese, and grilled chicken. another person in my party had the ""big easy"" sandwich which had very fresh fried shrimp. lastly another person had the ""Brussel Sprouts Salad"" with a crab cake which looked scrumptious as well. both the fries and sweet potato fries were amazing."
southern-grit-knoxville,Cass G.,"Knoxville, TN",3/28/2021,5.0,Finally made it for Sunday brunch.  Chicken and waffles... my new jam!  Excellent service and atmosphere as usual!
southern-grit-knoxville,Cass G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/25/2020,5.0,MY FAVORITE PLACE IN KNOXVILLE.  The best southern cooking I have ever experienced.  The staff are super friendly and on point.  The Macncheese should be illegal .  Best fried chicken and the meatloaf is a must.  Don't plan on doing anything after dinner except relax because you will be full.  I'll be back next week.. and the next.. and the next...
southern-grit-knoxville,B D.,"Newark, IL",3/24/2021,5.0,Got right in and seated quickly with a table of five.Ordered the house version of an old fashioned... it was awesome. We ordered Jambalaya.. shrimp and grits... waffles and chicken... crab cakes.. and a crazy garbage type sandwich.Simply... we are going back again soon.
southern-grit-knoxville,Melissa K.,"Winston-Salem, NC",3/24/2021,4.0,"My family and I had high hopes for this restaurant, and overall, we were pleased with our experience. The service was fabulous, the appetizers and desserts were amazing, but the entrees left a lot to be desired. I hate to say this, but truly the worst shrimp and grits I've ever eaten. Too scarce on the grits and the shrimp was way too spicy and dry. One member of our party got the crab cake sandwich and she didn't like it either. The biscuits though, are the bomb. Macaroni and cheese pretty good. Creamy collards are delicious. I had never had them before, and theirs made such a fan of me that I went home and looked up recipes to try myself. The Banana pudding is as good as my Grandmama made. Fried pickles and okra were good too, and they give you an ample amount for sharing. I will give this place another chance. I'm thinking the chicken pot pie or meatloaf are worth a shot. Everything else though is so good that I will continue to eat here even if it's ultimately for everything but the entrees."
southern-grit-knoxville,Amanda M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/21/2021,5.0,"This was the perfect spot to bring my friends for a Saturday brunch! We got bloody Mary's and frozen drinks,  biscuit donuts, brussel sprouts, fried chicken, fries, biscuits and bacon, and burgers. We loved everything!!!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Codi P.,"La Follette, TN",3/21/2021,5.0,OMGoodness! It was like going to grandmas after church on Sunday! Absolutely delicious! Fried green tomatoes are the best in Knoxville. Biscuits to die for. Shrimp and grits are amazing. Banana pudding is THe BEST! Everything is so fresh and unbelievably tasty! On the corner across from the parking lot so it's convenient too! Just go already!
southern-grit-knoxville,Tyler P.,"Clinton, TN",3/17/2021,4.0,"This place was on my list to try for a while, and was glad I was able to last night!! It took a few seconds to be greeted when we first arrived, so we were a bit confused as to whether we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait on a host. Once seated, our drink and appetizer orders were quickly taken. The appetizers came out fairly quickly. The simple buttered saltines with pimento cheese dip were surprisingly wonderful. The biscuits with honey butter will make your mouth water!! The pepper jelly is okay, but not for me. I had the fried chicken tenders with okra and creamy collards for my sides. I was mistakenly brought out mashed potatoes instead of the collards first, so I got a ""freebie"" side to try! The chicken was so good. I tried the medium, and the spice was just right for me...not so hot it couldn't be enjoyed! The fried okra was my least favorite thing I tried. I don't think it was breaded in-house, and didn't stand out at all. The creamy collards were pretty good, although I'd probably try the mac and cheese next time! The mashed potatoes were extremely flavorful, which probably means they're loaded with butter - YUM! Halfway through the meal and toward the end, our service kind of declined, with our waiter not being as attentive as he was toward the beginning. Once we received our check, several items were not correctly inputted. The appetizers were entered as pimento cheese fries and fried green tomatoes (instead of the pimento cheese dip and biscuits). We were up-charged $2 on both meals for some time of Brussels sprouts, which neither of us had. Because we were so full and ready to roll out, I didn't mention it! We were too full to dry the desserts, but definitely want to try again!! Although the chicken would be hard not to get again, I'm curious about their burgers and meatloaf!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Alex P.,"Miami, FL",3/15/2021,4.0,"Even if you like spice, get the regular chicken. The spicy chicken has a breading that tastes like hot Sauce. Shrimp and grits was a little soggy. Service was really good. Food was good."
southern-grit-knoxville,Estefania S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/11/2021,5.0,Delicious food. I went in on a quiet weekday for lunch and was sat immediately. Tables are spaced out. The location is in a great area. Great music and atmosphere. The lunch staff were great.
southern-grit-knoxville,Jenn W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2021,5.0,"We ate here a couple of weeks ago during the week.  The inside has a cool vibe, and our server was very friendly and helpful.  We started with the friend green tomato appetizer.  It was great, and I particularly loved that each slice had a little scoop of pimento cheese.  So good!  For our entrees, I had the shrimp and grits, and my husband had the jambalaya pasta.  Both were excellent!  We will definitely be back!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Clyde B.,"Montgomery, AL",2/14/2021,5.0,"Best food experience I've had in quite a while.  Went for Sunday brunch.  For 12 bucks you can get a bottle of champagne with a side of orange juice AWESOME!!  Tried the fried green tomato app and it was spot on delicious, really great.  For the main course we got a buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and 2 piece chicken dinner with fried okra and cheese grits.  Everything was great.  Wait staff was a teeny bit disorganized but honestly no big deal at all as they were super nice and polite plus all wearing masks.  The restaurant itself is a great space, a bit noisy but it was very busy.  I think I could go there for brunch every Sunday and it would be great."
southern-grit-knoxville,Al G.,"College Park, MD",9/10/2021,2.0,They used to be good until they took the only vegetarian meal off the menu. It's a weird business move since it guarantees you'll lose business from vegetarians and their spouses/friend groups who are looking to eat together. If they added another veggie option we will certainly be back in the future.
southern-grit-knoxville,Codi P.,"La Follette, TN",3/21/2021,5.0,OMGoodness! It was like going to grandmas after church on Sunday! Absolutely delicious! Fried green tomatoes are the best in Knoxville. Biscuits to die for. Shrimp and grits are amazing. Banana pudding is THe BEST! Everything is so fresh and unbelievably tasty! On the corner across from the parking lot so it's convenient too! Just go already!
southern-grit-knoxville,Brent A.,"Alpharetta, GA",3/3/2020,5.0,Loved the foodLoved the serviceLoved the atmosphereHated the wait but a long wait typically indicates what you're gonna get... and it was good stuff.
southern-grit-knoxville,Sarah E.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2020,3.0,"I decided to try this place because there are soo many good reviews. I went with my family and went around dinner time. Pretty much all the tables were filled so it was pretty loud in there. They give you these tiny water glasses to drink out of, if you don't want to get a drink. I ordered the fried chicken with Mac and cheese with a biscuit. The fried chicken was okay. It didn't have much flavor to me. The Mac and cheese was good. When we were done eating we waited almost 30 minutes to get our check. I would understand if our server was busy but he was just standing around. The food was okay. I didn't live up to the hype that I thought it would."
southern-grit-knoxville,Megan R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/27/2020,5.0,"This was our first visit and I am so pleased with the food. It was amazing. My husband and friends all enjoyed the items they got. Of course we had to sample each other's food. I tried the waffle and maple syrup. That was what my husband had, then I tried a piece off my friend plate was crab cake on homemade biscuits with fried eye which surprisingly was really good. I had the Penny which was biscuits, sausage gravy, fried eggs, and hash browns casserole and it was amazing as well. Definitely will recommend"
southern-grit-knoxville,Anthony A.,"Washington, DC",8/9/2020,5.0,OMG!!i would visit Knoxville again Just' to try something else on the menu!! Bust grits ever!! Reasonable prices as well.
southern-grit-knoxville,Courtny A.,"Saugus, CA",6/28/2020,4.0,"This place was so cute inside! The fried tomatoes for an appetizer were amazing! I split chicken strips and fries and the chicken was very tasty and fresh. We got the southern style so it wasn't spicy. I tried their frozen sangria and that was very good! The only thing I don't like is that they have everyone download the menu on their phone.Overall, staff and food were great."
southern-grit-knoxville,Carley M.,"Monroe, NC",8/13/2021,4.0,"this place is amazing cute and the waiters were super nice and attentive since we were the only ones in the restaurant. definitely not my idea of southern food everything was pretty mediocre tbh. i got the scrimp and grits and instead of cheese, bacon, chives and such it was topped with at least a whole cooked green pepper and tomato both cooked in the same sauce as my bfs meal the jambalaya pasta. i felt they just took the left over sauce from his and was like eh yea let's just put it on hers too. as side orders to try we had gotten hushpuppies and mashed potatoes and the hushpuppies were decent.but the mashed potatoes were the worse thing i ate while i was in TN they were pure liquid i couldn't even get them on to my fork they just ran right through. but they did do sweet tea justice."
southern-grit-knoxville,Blaine W.,"Indianapolis, IN",1/5/2020,4.0,"I enjoyed this new place in Old City with a casual vibe.  My Shrimp and Grits were really good with a lot of shrimp and andouille sausage.  My wife got the mahi mahi and my son enjoyed the cheeseburger.  The noise level is high, might be due to the concrete floors."
southern-grit-knoxville,Stephanie C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/7/2021,4.0,I've had the salad and the meatloaf tine 2 different occasions and they were great! Great atmosphere
southern-grit-knoxville,Crystal P.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2020,5.0,"The food and atmosphere were great! The service was top notch, and they accommodated a large party for my birthday. We will definitely be back."
southern-grit-knoxville,Kevin K.,"Fletcher, NC",11/14/2020,5.0,"This was an amazing restaurant all around. We had a GREAT server which translated to great service holistically. I ordered the white zombie white ale and paired it with the white meat chicken fried chicken, medium heat with sweet potato fries and cucumber salad. The sweet potato fries are insanely good, probably the best I've ever had. My gf got two sliders- the meatloaf slider and the cheeseburger slider with an order of fries. She highly recommends the meatloaf slider. Overall it is a five star restaurant in my book. We will make it a regular spot!!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Stephen K.,"Irvine, CA",3/9/2020,4.0,"The chicken was a must get, the crispy yet well sauced combo was definitely impressive."
southern-grit-knoxville,Amanda S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7/5/2021,5.0,"This is a really cute restaurant serving upscale takes on traditional Southern food, and they do it really well.  My husband and I have been here twice, and both times we very much enjoyed our food.  The warm pimento cheese with buttered saltines and the hushpuppies with honey butter were both excellent starters; I've never had buttered saltines, but they were addictive!  I got the fried chicken (two piece white, medium spice) both times and was really pleased with it - it was seasoned well, very crispy, moist, and not too greasy, just really well done classic fried chicken.  My husband got a chicken sandwich (can't recall exactly which one) on one visit and the meatloaf on the other and enjoyed both.  The sides of fried okra and mac and cheese were quite good, but not outstanding.  My mac and cheese on one occasion arrived lukewarm bordering on cold, but our waiter was extremely helpful and quickly replaced it.  We both loved the biscuits that came with our entrees - very light, fluffy, and buttery!  Overall, would definitely recommend, especially for a date night!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Sammy m.,"Plainfield, IL",6/24/2021,5.0,"Went here as a little stop while in Knoxville and loved the food and scene of the restaurant. Blush and Bashful is definitely an amazing and sweet cocktail. Overall amazing place and Blake was the best worker there. He stopped a guy from soliciting towards us, got our waitress for us, and then ran two blocks to give us a purse we left behind. He is the ultimate description of best worker. Blake made our day and I would definitely recommend going there and giving him more shoutouts."
southern-grit-knoxville,Tyler P.,"Clinton, TN",3/17/2021,4.0,"This place was on my list to try for a while, and was glad I was able to last night!! It took a few seconds to be greeted when we first arrived, so we were a bit confused as to whether we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait on a host. Once seated, our drink and appetizer orders were quickly taken. The appetizers came out fairly quickly. The simple buttered saltines with pimento cheese dip were surprisingly wonderful. The biscuits with honey butter will make your mouth water!! The pepper jelly is okay, but not for me. I had the fried chicken tenders with okra and creamy collards for my sides. I was mistakenly brought out mashed potatoes instead of the collards first, so I got a ""freebie"" side to try! The chicken was so good. I tried the medium, and the spice was just right for me...not so hot it couldn't be enjoyed! The fried okra was my least favorite thing I tried. I don't think it was breaded in-house, and didn't stand out at all. The creamy collards were pretty good, although I'd probably try the mac and cheese next time! The mashed potatoes were extremely flavorful, which probably means they're loaded with butter - YUM! Halfway through the meal and toward the end, our service kind of declined, with our waiter not being as attentive as he was toward the beginning. Once we received our check, several items were not correctly inputted. The appetizers were entered as pimento cheese fries and fried green tomatoes (instead of the pimento cheese dip and biscuits). We were up-charged $2 on both meals for some time of Brussels sprouts, which neither of us had. Because we were so full and ready to roll out, I didn't mention it! We were too full to dry the desserts, but definitely want to try again!! Although the chicken would be hard not to get again, I'm curious about their burgers and meatloaf!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Frank M.,"Northford, CT",12/14/2019,5.0,Another new spot in Knoxville's old city-fresh looks for a classic old city spot-exceptionally clean-great beverage choices varied & tasty-great choices to be had off the new menu ALL with the southern focus-attentive staff was not overbearing-great spot to try out!!!
southern-grit-knoxville,Jason L.,"Portland, OR",1/4/2020,5.0,"I've been staying downtown and was walking around an came upon Southern Grit. If you are staying downtown it's worth the walk from anywhere downtown and if you're not staying downtown it's worth the drive from anywhere. Really exceptional food and service. I'm a fried chicken snob and this is some of the best I've ever had. Mashed potatoes and gravy were spot on and the creamy collards I'll be dreaming about later. I had to get the banana pudding to go so I'll let you know. Don't miss coming here, you won't regret it. Of course don't come here when I'm planning to because I don't want to wait for a table. Thank's to Jade for the stellar service and recommendations..."
southern-grit-knoxville,Meredith C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2020,5.0,"I ordered the chicken and waffle and wow baby it was good! I got my chicken southern style, after a great explanation by the bartender. The spicy honey drizzle on top gave it just enough heat for me, no need to make the chicken any spicier! It was tender and came out piping hot! The waffle was light, fluffy, and delicious! My husband got the smothered pork chop with okra and cheese grits. Everything was top notch. Juicy meat, cheesy grits, crunchy okra.Enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere, and such a convenient location in the old city! We will be back for the skillet cobbler!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Liza H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/28/2020,5.0,First time eating here and the food was absolutely amazing. I ordered the meatloaf with creamy collards and fried okra. My husband ordered the jambalaya pasta. We were constantly eating off of each other's place the entire night. Don't sleep on the fried green tomatoes or biscuits either!
southern-grit-knoxville,Dianne S.,"PA, PA",11/1/2021,3.0,"We went out of our way to find a fun, funky local place with good food. Sort of found it. Took a while for our server to come to the table (it was a sign of continued lack of service). We ordered chicken pot pie and two piece chicken with sides. The chicken pot pie was served on a plate with two biscuits dropped on top. Unusual but flavorful and lots of chicken. Problem was it wasn't hot, hardly warm, again no server around. The two piece chicken was hot, flavorful but dry (fried twice), the hash brown casserole was warm at best (when something is 'cheesy' it should be served hot otherwise it is 'gloopy'). The salad was good and the biscuit was fresh and a bit warm, would have loved some butter, again no server around. Here's what really gets me, from where we were seated I saw two other couples come into the restaurant after us. They were seated, served, ate, paid and left before we got our bill. I finally went to the bar and asked for our check. The server dropped it off, we had our credit card on the table and the host came picked it up and returned for our signature. Yes I am patient during these times, yes I understand restaurants are short staffed but dear restaurant owner you must also provide a service in order to continue to receive income. Southern Grit has potential but it will be quite a while before we return."
southern-grit-knoxville,Alan S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/14/2020,4.0,This is a great addition to old town.Comfort food at its finest!! Draft beer menu is limited but some good selections.I recommend the shrimp and grits plenty of shrimp and delicious. The vibe is good but a little noisy due to the concrete décor.
southern-grit-knoxville,Patty P.,"Anchorage, AK",1/22/2020,5.0,I rarely review mediocre restaurants. Reason being they are usually chains and my reviews become cut and paste. This is not a mediocre restaurant by any stretch of the imagination. At the recommendation of our super cool server I ordered the shrimp and grits. Have you ever tasted something so delicious that you begin to shake and become speechless? C'mon now I am serious. Anyway Unbelievable. Yes the restaurant itself is very cool and I love the retro bar stools. The thing is everything is about the food. My husband ordered the fried chicken with two sides - Mac and cheese and a sweet potato thingy. Best fried chicken I have ever had. I know because I stole a wing off his plate. So give up on all those  awful chain restaurants and come to this restaurant. You will love it!!!!
southern-grit-knoxville,Estefania S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/11/2021,5.0,Delicious food. I went in on a quiet weekday for lunch and was sat immediately. Tables are spaced out. The location is in a great area. Great music and atmosphere. The lunch staff were great.
southern-grit-knoxville,Ricardito C.,"Lakeland, FL",12/14/2019,1.0,"Started out a great experience: super cute and clean restaurant, great burger, and friendly service, until the entire experience went downhill. My friends and I waited a long while for our food (new brunch place so it's understandable) and when it arrived, my friend found a hair in her Mac n cheese. We had to wait 25 minutes for the server to return so she could tell them. They apologized and gave her a new bowl of Mac n cheese that tasted like straight butter and oil. At this point we were over the place and wanted to leave. The waiter would not return for another 30 minutes (and only because we flagged him down from across the restaurant) to get our bill. The manager never came to apologize for a literal hair in their food, which surprised me. Will not return and definitely not recommend to a friend"
southern-grit-knoxville,Alex H.,"Knoxville, TN",1/30/2020,5.0,"The shrimp n grits here is to die for! Huge portions, delicious southern comfort food. Service was great. It was a little slow but they were slammed as it had recently opened. I can't wait to go back!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Kim C.,"Washington, DC",1/9/2020,5.0,"I am always looking for new and exciting places in Knoxville since we moved here from DC a couple of years ago.  Southern Grit delivers.  I had lunch there yesterday with 2 friends and each had something outstanding.  I had the pot pie which was more like a deconstructed dish with the chicken and inside goodies of a pot pie in a bowl with two biscuits on top instead of crust.  Very creative and yummy!  One lady had shrimp and grits which she said was the best she had ever had.  The other lady had fried chicken which was good (not amazing) but had a side of creamy greens that were fantastic.  If you want to have traditional southern dishes with a twist, try this place.  It will NOT disappoint!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Taylor L.,"Elizabethton, TN",9/15/2020,5.0,The food and service was great! I love pimento cheese so I got the Everette and my boyfriend got the Penny McGill. They were both delicious!
southern-grit-knoxville,Kevin S.,"Savannah, GA",7/22/2020,5.0,"Staff is very courteous and welcoming. This is by far the best new happy hour in the Old City. With Balter not serving happy hour food specials, welcome Southern Grit to the top spot. The sliders and wings are flavorful and unique, not some mundane burger patty. In addition, the drinks specials cannot be beaten, craft draft beer, wine, well drinks and frozen cocktails are all delicious. I would recommend each one of the sliders and the wings. Don't forget to get something to go too."
southern-grit-knoxville,Dana K.,"Knoxville, TN",1/30/2020,5.0,Cool new place in the old city. We weeny for brunch and I always get the same thing everywhere I go.. shrimp and grits. They were great and my second favorite in Knoxville. My friend ordered the steak and eggs which was ordered rare and it came out medium well. They still get 5 stars because they fixed it right away (it came out perfect) and comped it. Great service all around and cool atmosphere.
southern-grit-knoxville,Alex H.,"Knoxville, TN",1/30/2020,5.0,"The shrimp n grits here is to die for! Huge portions, delicious southern comfort food. Service was great. It was a little slow but they were slammed as it had recently opened. I can't wait to go back!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Lisa L.,"Morristown, TN",1/30/2020,5.0,"This place has the absolute BEST fried chicken in the universe!  I had the medium dark meat and it was spicy without being too hot.  And juicy! The biscuits were so good-light, fluffy and delish! Also had the bag of shrimp.  So good! I would have preferred the shrimp ""ready to eat"" instead of peel and eat, but it was still good . Def try the cocktail Ti the Cows Come Home!"
southern-grit-knoxville,Blake W.,"Old City, Knoxville, TN",1/25/2020,4.0,"Definitely hit the spot! I had the 2-piece fried chicken (all white meat). I chose the ""medium"" spic batter, but if you typically like spicy food, I'd go with ""hot"". The chicken was fried and seasoned PERFECTLY! Had the Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes - I'd make the Mac and cheese a regular side selection, but the gravy for the mashed potatoes was  a little too heavy on the rosemary for my liking. Comes with a biscuit and WOW it was SO GOOD! Definitely a southern biscuit on all accounts. Overall, this is a great spot when you've got a comfort food craving - especially if you're looking for an elevated but simple meal. They have a great drink and dessert selection as well."

southern-grit-knoxville,Taylor C.,"Richmond, VA",5/15/2020,5.0,"We were driving through Knoxville and ordered dinner for pickup online. All of the food was absolutely delicious.

southern-grit-knoxville,David H.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/20/2020,5.0,Great food. The two piece southern fried chicken was great. The spicy version is eye watering. Great burgers as well. The staff was very friendly.

southern-grit-knoxville,Alan F.,"Knoxville, TN",2/3/2020,5.0,"I was looking for a place near the Mill and Mine for a large birthday dinner before a concert. With 16 of us, all coming from different parts of Knoxville, we wanted a place easy for everyone to get to, and where we could all sit together. In the Old City that doesn't leave us very many choices. I was lucky enough to stumble upon a new restaurant called The Southern Grit. I noticed they didn't take reservations and submitted an online request to see what possibilities they might have. I received a call back from the night manager Rachel and we discussed what they might could do for our party. If we could come in a bit earlier and commit to the party of 16 they would do their best to accommodate us. While this wasn't as good as a firm reservation, we all agreed it was worth a shot. I confirmed with the restaurant a few days before our Saturday arrival.  I am so glad we chose The Southern Grit! They exceeded my expectations and everything was perfect. We parked at a pay lot across the street ($10) which was very convenient to the restaurant and about 5 blocks from the concert venue. There was free parking a few blocks away too.  When I walked into the restaurant with my wife (the birthday lady!) we loved the interior, very nice looking and smelled amazing. We noticed our table right in front, a HUGE wooden table just perfect for 16 people! I imagine they serve community style on nights they don't have parties of 16, but the table was just the right size for 16 to sit very comfortably. Our server took good care of us, keeping the drinks flowing and nobody went thirsty or hungry. Our food orders came out hot and we had a bit of everything - Shrimp and Grits, Fish, Steak, Salad, Fried Chicken, Chicken Pot Pie, and even some appetizers. Every bite on every plate was consumed, no doggy bags from our party! The food was all delicious. The shrimp and grits seemed to be everyone's favorite overall. Beer, liquor, and wine choices were not too plentiful, but they had a nice selection in all categories. Prices were decent, exactly what we expected from a night out at a nice place in Knoxville.  Our party of 16 stayed for 2 hours of eating and drinking and everything was just perfect. We are all saying we will be coming back. Check it out for yourself, you won't be disappointed!"
southern-grit-knoxville,J H.,"CONCORD FARR, TN",12/31/2019,3.0,"Went to Southern Grit Saturday night. We were seated promptly. The menu was fine. Ordered the white fired chicken. It was very moist and crunchy. The sweet potatoes were overdone. Would go back, but the noise level was overwhelming. Everyone in our party agreed that this would keep us from returning. Only other comment is they need to have larger water glasses or be able to refill the water bottle in a timely manner."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Michele G.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/8/2022,5.0,"Excellent place! I came solo for dinner so I sat at the ""chef's counter"". I ordered a few apps - the summer vegetable salad w/ smoked trout plus the PEI mussels and the grilled okra. Everything was delicious and the service was very upscale. Dining alone it would have been nice if it wasn't a Tuesday so the bar scene would have been better. Cocktails were great though. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and it seems like it could be one for a special night out if needed."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Michelle R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/23/2022,5.0,"I've been to J C Holdway several times over the years - usually to celebrate a special occasion since it is considered one of the best and nicest restaurants in Knoxville. I like to wear something a little nicer when I dine here, but there are plenty of people who keep it casual. Absolutely make a reservation - especially for a weekend evening, you'll want to be sure to book over a week in advance.I'm vegetarian and for the most part I'm still able to have a great meal here. One time we just ordered a bunch of sides and small plates to go and it was incredible. But my most recent dine in experience was a bit underwhelming. JC used to have this delicious grain bowl type dish with broccolini that was a unique veg option and my go-to every time. Now they have vegetarian pasta options which is great! But if I want good pasta for dinner I'd rather just go to Emilia. My last visit might have been a 4 but overall gotta give JC a 5 for its commitment to quality food and service over the years."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Caleigh J.,"TN, TN",4/22/2022,5.0,"UNBEATABLE!J C Holdway honors wood-fire creations, exciting new menus, southern techniques, locally grown produce, and rural Appalachian infusions! Each dish is served family style and is more surprising than the last. The oven roasted chicken was like none I've ever tried before, mainly because they choose to salt-brine for two days before roasting. J C Holdway's process forms deep flavors and an impressively light and crisp skin on the chicken. Do NOT overlook the pasta! A New York Times article is being written on this dish and you don't want to miss the chance to try it! From the cornbread crumble to the Benton's bacon, there's nothing like this dish anywhere else. Finally, I wouldn't normally mention a salad, but oh my! The salad is a rich combination of herbs grown by the head chef, Joseph Lenn, himself. J C Holdway provides a beautiful atmosphere, incredible taste sensations, and the kind of service where your glass will never run empty and you'll want to invite them to sit down at the table! For any special occasion, there's always a cost, but J C Holdway's is worth every penny. Not to mention, you'll support a local Knoxville business, farmers, and gardens galore!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Adriana F.,"Sparta Township, NJ",7/30/2022,5.0,"My husband and I dined here for his birthday dinner. With its signature red and blue creusets and the simple yet sophisticated decor, J. C. Holdway stands in a league of its own. I loved the split wood walls separating us from other diners and giving us a bit of privacy. The fresh sunflowers and illuminating oil lit candles add a warm and inviting touch. For our appetizer, we savored the scallion hush puppies. My husband especially liked the flavor boost of the basil aioli sauce. You get a total of four, and I would highly recommend these for a light appetizer. For our entrees, we both ordered the Springer Mountain stuffed chicken. What is nice about the chicken and many of the ingredients that Chef Joseph Lenn uses is that most of them are locally sourced. Served with potato purée, summer greens and mushrooms, the chicken was out of this world. I especially loved how they got the outside of the chicken nice and crispy, without ever over-drying the meat on the inside. My husband also had a Pilsner along with his celebratory meal, which was perfectly poured. A special thank you to our sweet waitress, Sadie, who took phenomenal care of us and always made sure we had everything we needed. If you want a quality meal for any occasion paired with an outstanding level of experience, this is your place. They do rotate their menu seasonally, so be sure to check it out before you go."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,J F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",8/17/2022,5.0,The best we have had in Knoxville. Very fresh and tasty. Service was great. Greeter was a little curt. Place was about a quarter full and we had reservations and they made a big deal we're 10 minutes early. Only in a small town. Food was great and wine was perfect temp. We will be back.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Colin C.,"Oak Ridge, TN",8/6/2022,5.0,"Delicious, enticing, refined, welcoming. I've only eaten here once, but I'll definitely come back. Cocktails were terrific, entrees were comforting w a new take on some classic American fare. The pasta was particularly mouthwatering. Service was outstanding. Highly recommend"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Kelly F.,"TN, TN",3/19/2022,5.0,"I thought I'd be writing an update, since we had been here a few years back (before covid and their closure for renovations). Can't find that review...but I know I loved it then and loved it tonight.The menu is small but with excellent and creative dishes of every type (small plates, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts). Also lots of creative drinks as well as classics with good ingredients (we tried three-- all very tasty, two of them made with their house-made ginger beer). Well, now that I think about it, I will say maybe their draft beer selections missed anything on the porter/stout side....which is partly why I went with cocktails instead.We had as our main dish osso bucco, which was tender and so tasty-- closest to quality steak taste of any pork dish I've ever had. Wanted to try more dishes but we had asked about desserts early on, and knew we wanted to try a few of them. We loved an Italian ice cream (sort of) dish; the cheesecake was tasty but not as great as we were hoping.  Still, overall a wonderful meal.Service was ON POINT-- maybe we got even better than usual, as our waiter had a trainee with him so between the two we felt very well catered to.I took a picture of the osso bucco after we'd started attacking it....will see if I can post it later. But this was a wonderful meal, picture or not!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Lauren Q.,"Knoxville, TN",2/20/2022,5.0,"Fantastic 2nd time for hubby and I and 1st visit for his parents at J.C. Holdway for bday dinner. Smoked fish dip w/ bbq chips, sorghum butter cornbread, onion jam brussel sprouts, squid ink lobster and shrimp pasta, and prime ribeye with potatoes, butternut squash, and broccolini. Can't wait to go back already! Service is always outstanding as well"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Lauren Q.,"Knoxville, TN",12/4/2021,5.0,"Amazing service, food, and ambiance.  Can't believe I've lived in town for years and never been until now, and can't wait to go back!!!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Sheila P.,"Knoxville, TN",1/29/2022,5.0,Freshly a resident of Knoxville and this was the best meal since the move. Cocktails are fab - the ginger beer used in the dark & stormy was made in house. I'm celiac and the GF was very apparent and very knowledgeable staff to boot in that regard. Erin and Ken made our night. We will be back!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Patrice G.,"New Lenox, IL",7/3/2022,5.0,"Woohoo! This restaurant checked off every box I have in mind for a perfect dining experience! * friendly and accommodating hostess* beautiful decor* exceptional and friendly service from managers, waiter (Tate was great:), and bus boys* DELICIOUS food and drinks that were perfect sized portions Can't say enough good things about this place!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Lucy R.,"Miami, FL",5/14/2022,5.0,"Sewer smell in bar area April 15th. Should offer half portion pastas as apps to encourage entree sales and grow the check. Thumbs inside plates touching my salads while delivering is not appetizing, but the food, ambiance and service are outstanding."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Dylan S.,"Knoxville, TN",11/3/2020,5.0,"JC Holdway is consistently one of the best restaurants in Knoxville. This place never lets me down.  The dishes are always well balanced, plated beautifully, and seasoned perfectly.  Whether you do a prix fixe menu or order an individual entree you can't go wrong. The smoked trout dip and wings are great appetizers.  The trout entree is fantastic as is the ribeye. They offer a few creative cocktails and have few but decent beer options. During COVID they have been offering weekly Prix fixe menus which are a little pricey but worth it if your looking for a nice dinner/night out."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Marco G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/16/2022,4.0,The parsley mash potatoes are definitely a try. You will need reservations on the weekends. Decent wine selection great for a casual night out.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Marco G.,"Knoxville, TN",3/30/2019,1.0,"Maybe Michael (server) just had a bad day but having to wait 45+ minutes after ordering our entrée is not acceptable. Understandable if the kitchen is backed-up and everyone has to wait no problem but having a table seated next to us after we order and they get their entrée first, again, not acceptable. I did speak with the GM and he was very professional. I hope this is a one-time experience because I've had many enjoyable ones."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Lucinda E.,"Fort Mill, SC",10/15/2021,5.0,"We had a wonderful dinner here last night, everything was cooked to profection and the flavors really popped.Appetizer we had the Bone Marrow.. let me say wow..flavor city...something I had never had before .for the meal we split the Ribeye Steak with broccoli, squash and smoked potatoes.. such wonderful flavor.. steak was cooked perfect.. and the Ossa Bucco with cheddar grits hit the spot.."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Brett F.,"Suwanee, GA",6/11/2022,5.0,"Visiting Knoxville and read some good reviews and gave it a try. Was half a block from our hotel (The Oliver). Greeted and seated right away with a reservation I made. Our waiter Zachary was phenomenal with his knowledge and passion for serving his customer. We tried the beef tarter, an egg small plate, hush puppies and corn bread. Everything was delicious. We never got a Jain course as we had been satisfied. We did leave room for the 3 scoops of homemade ice cream. Great ending. If you are a foodie that enjoys chef prepared farm to table, this is the place. We will be back."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jenn W.,"Knoxville, TN",3/10/2021,4.0,"I wanted to love J.C. Holdway because I've heard so many good things about it.  My husband and I finally visited a couple of weeks ago, and it was good.  However, it didn't blow me away as I'd hoped & expected.To start, the restaurant is beautiful, although it felt a tad bright.  I enjoyed being able to get a glimpse into the kitchen.  And I imagine sitting at the bar would be enjoyable (it wasn't open during our visit, I assume due to Covid).We started with cocktails, shrimp cocktail, and the pimento cheese appetizer.  My husband didn't particularly like the cocktail sauce, but we both enjoyed the pimento cheese.For dinner, we ordered a bottle of wine and both ended up choosing the half chicken, which came with potato puree and broccolini.  We also had a mini skillet of cornbread, which honestly was my favorite part of the meal.Service was excellent.  However, the entire dinner felt like we were subtly being rushed through the process.  I think from the time we walked in the door until we departed was 45 minutes.  It just didn't end up feeling like a special night out like I'd hoped for."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,John K.,"Knoxville, TN",7/9/2022,1.0,We had a table of 12 - 6 couples and were informed after being seated that they couldn't split the bills except for 4 credit cards (without itemization) each would be 1/4 of the bill - what?   What do they do with 12 tables of 2 - split theirs.  Started the dinner off on a bad note. Several wanted to leave but we stayed as for 1 check (of which they would itemize) and we will figure it out later.  Never eat here again no matter how the food is.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Erika M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/31/2021,5.0,"Hands down and without question JC Holdway is one of my favorite restaurants in Knoxville.  And during these crazy covid-times I truly miss eating dinner in their beautiful dining room or grabbing a cocktail at the bar and watching the magic happen in their open kitchen.  These days the stools at the bar have been taken by stuffed animals and I've gotten used to the presentation of a James Beard restaurant being lost in taken out boxes.  What's magical is that the incredible food inside of said take out boxes hasn't lost a hint of the flavor that I know and love.  How good is their food?  So good, I say, that I may have set an alarm at 8:58pm THREE NIGHTS IN A ROW to order their lasagna prix fixe meal before it sold out.  The third night I was successful and happy tears wouldn't have been overreacting.  We picked up our meal curbside at the designated time and it was delivered to the car hot and fresh! For this particular meal they had partnered with our local icon, Benton, for Benton's Bacon Lasagna, mixed winter greens salad with beets and pickled radishes (the vinaigrette was to die for!), rosemary focaccia bread, handmade lemon thyme sorbet, and a bottle of wine.  Woah!  It was incredible.  The lasagna was maybe the best I've ever had. The lemony ricotta made every bite taste fresh and kept it from being too rich.  The focaccia was basically perfect.  The flavor rivaled the textured which was perfectly crisp on the edges and soft and light on the inside.  Only because I have come to expect complete perfect was I even slightly disappointed in the sorbet.  The texture was great, but the lemon to thyme balance was heavy on the herbal side and could have used just a hint of the tart lemon.  Take out will never be better than eating in house at JC Holdway, but I certainly am not mad about the takeout options. It's so nice to be able to enjoy a super top notch meal at home.  In fact, I hope these prix fixe meals are a thing that sticks after the pandemic is over."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Gabby R.,"Long Beach, NY",3/8/2021,5.0,"I love coming to this spot whenever I am in Knoxville. Everything here is so good - some of my favorite dishes are their wings, and their stake (the potato pave on the side is so good). There's also just a very nice vibe in the restaurant, not too upscale/snobby but still great quality food."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Lynda R.,"Powell, TN",7/9/2022,5.0,This is a unique place in downtown. I love that the food is wood fired. The menu has something for everyone and everything taste wonderful. This restaurant is great for a date night or an evening out with friends and family.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Priscilla O.,"San Francisco, CA",6/1/2021,5.0,"What got me excited was that they prepared the entire trout, not just the disembodiment of one. The trout appeared at our table in a giant Le Creuset basin, and there was plenty of it for us both. The fish was perfectly grilled, all the way down to the cheeks and gelatinous eyeballs. The accompanying faro and radicchio were imbued with a smoky flavor and complemented the succulent flesh. The cornbread was equally delicious with just a hint of grittiness and not at all cakey. The book choy was interesting but I tasted cumin, a spice I don't care for. As a palate cleanser dessert, the sorbet trio was perfect. The flavors tonight were strawberry, lemon buttermilk and lemon thyme. The table service was excellent, with the pacing of each dish done perfectly."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Michael Y.,"San Francisco, CA",6/5/2021,5.0,"A very elevated dinner. All of our choices were exceptional. It is really great when you get the whole fish, not a de-boned, skinless filet. It was oven-roasted to perfection. The buttermilk lemon sorbet was a stand-out. Really good service, too."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Edward G.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2022,5.0,"What a fantastic meal. I had guests in town from New York, wanted something southern snd creative , high quality... jc holdway hit the mark on all accounts. The staff also helped a last minute additional guest. Top notch food, service, atmosphere. Highly recommended."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Krissy B.,"Columbia, SC",10/9/2021,5.0,"This is definitely one of the best restaurants in town. Dinner was sooooo good!! We had a party of 10 and we pretty much tried a little bit of everything. I highly recommend this place. My only complaint (and it's a small one) is that the restaurant itself has a weird smell, like your in your grandmas hundred year old home, I didn't care for it at all, and by the end of the meal I couldn't wait to step outside for breath of fresh air. Other than that go try it. You won't be disappointed, food is delicious"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Anonymous R.,"Tennessee City, TN",10/15/2021,5.0,"Had the chance to try this delicious gem of a place a few weeks ago and absolutely loved the experience. Our drinks were great, the oysters fresh, and everything we tried tasted absolutely delicious. The ambience is warm and inviting, and I loved the open kitchen appeal. Absolutely recommend"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Matthew M.,"Farragut, TN",10/7/2021,5.0,"Great food!  Space was a little small and odd.  Felt like being in a fish bowl the size of a shoe box.  But like I said, the food was amazing!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jared M.,"Knoxville, TN",8/10/2019,5.0,"I feel as though this is long overdue! Venue - It's great there is parking close by where it's an easy walk up to the restaurant. Inside the venue itself is very clean with lots of windows and natural light coming in. The setting has decor that lines up with the home+natural appeal. Staff - We have never had an unpleasant experience with anyone that performs any role. It's wonderful to be at a place where this is consistent. Service - Overall quality of service is above and beyond. Great balance of checking in at the right times for ordering, receiving courses and settling up.Food - Simply the best. Great combination of local+spice+presentation - definitely what keeps people coming back! And for me, it keeps me wanting to try something else I haven't before, because I am so trusting in the quality. Experience - 6/5 - nope, not a misprint, i'd rate 6 if i could!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Ben W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/13/2019,4.0,JC Holdway is a culinary gem in downtown Knoxville. Very cool vibe from the moment you walk in and the food delivers. You have the option to sit at the chef's table and watch the food preparation which I recommend.Most of the snacks are small plates are delightful. I would recommend just ordering several of those to share.

j-c-holdway-knoxville,J A.,"CONCORD FARR, TN",3/14/2022,5.0,There are a handful of truly special restaurants in Knoxville. This is easily one of Knoxville's best. We enjoyed another anniversary dinner there the other night and loved every bit of it. We especially enjoy sitting at the kitchen bar to watch the magic happen and talk to the cooks. What I always appreciate when sitting at that bar is that the staff seems just as happy to let you eat in peace as they are to engage in chatting about whatever is on your mind. On this latest visit we enjoyed chatting with the owner/head chef for several minutes. Every part of the experience is intentional and excellent. Go and enjoy.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Fernando R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2/23/2021,5.0,"I could give this spot 6 stars if I could. My wife and I started dating in Knoxville and this was one of the most magical dining experiences we experienced early on. The fact that every dish has a wood fire feel and taste coupled with the great finesse of its chef, J C Holdway is one of the best restaurants in Tennessee and perhaps the country. Go. Just. Go."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Suzanne D.,"Saint Louis, MO",7/16/2019,5.0,"When a business contact mentioned the J C Holdway was Joseph Lenn's Knoxville restaurant, I knew I needed to have dinner there. I never pass up the chance to have a meal from a Beard award winner. On our July evening visit, we chose to dine outside as the weather wasn't overbearing. The patio was busy, but not overcrowded. We perused the drink menu and went with two of the specialty cocktails. My bees knees was a perfect summertime refresher.For dinner, my companion and I both went with smaller plates instead of traditional entrees. I chose the roasted beet salad and the scallops. The beet salad featured a variety of lettuces and whipped ricotta. The blending of flavors and textures was outstanding. The three roasted scallops were medium in size and fork tender. They were seared and bursting with flavor complimented by the onion vinaigrette.  I could not pass up dessert on my last night in Knoxville so I splurged on the peanut semifreddo. Hello salty/sweet goodness! The semifreddo's texture was smooth and creamy. It was surrounded by carmel corn and small bits of mango. The result was deliciousness. I travel to Knoxville several times a year and will definitely return to J C Holdway's. I can't believe I hadn't been there before!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Aubrey V.,"Lexington, KY",8/22/2020,5.0,"We stopped to pick up lunch at J.C. Holdway on our way to the Smokies for a long weekend, and got the kale salad and wrap to eat in the car. They were so good, we decided to drive back to Knoxville Saturday night to have dinner there. The meal was absolutely incredible from start to finish. I'm not sure how meals usually work here, but at least at present, it's $65 for a four-course prix fixe meal (with an amuse bouche at the beginning and a treat with the bill). A wine pairing or full wine/beer/cocktail list is also available. Even my mock tail (the AP) was perfect! Service was great, and everything felt very safe and clean, even sitting indoors. I wish I could have this restaurant closer to where I live! Knoxville is lucky to have it."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jeana H.,"Providence, RI",7/15/2019,5.0,"This is quite possibly (who am I kidding, it is!) the best restaurant in Knoxville. Every time I visit I leave and think to myself ""why don't I go here more often?"" It's certainly a treat- the cocktails are delicious, every food item is delicious, great service, and the whole aesthetic is on point. I took my Mom here last weekend and she loved it! As a vegetarian, it is sometimes hard to find restaurants that work for her. I finally convinced her she would love J.C Holdway. We ordered the cornbread, several vegetarian dishes, and pork belly biscuits for me. I can't eat here without an order of pork belly biscuits. The highlight was the potato purée and the roasted chanterelles. Both were spectacular!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Tamara D.,"Carmel, IN",10/28/2021,1.0,"We walked in at 5pm during our walk with our dogs. We made a reservation for 730pm on their patio when we confirmed that our dogs were allowed. There were only 3 tables outdoors and we wanted to secure the reservation since we were bringing our dogs. We arrived at 715pm and we were told that ""we might want to take a walk because it was going to be closer to 8"" before we were seated. No thanks. We had already been on walks with our pups waiting on our dinner reservation.   (At 5pm when we made our reservation it was clear we were on a walk with our pups,). When we arrived, and we're told this, they made no offer to make any accommodations for us, whatsoever. No apologies, no attempt at a resolution. It was clear that they didn't care to about our reservation as none of the tables outside were even close to finishing. Why make a reservation if you don't plan to honor it? Who wants to show up for a reservation and be told ""go for a walk???"" Not us! And we won't be back. PS: they automatically changed our reservation to the later time and communicated via text with a time to arrive... unbelievable. Again, why take a reservation if there is no attempt to honor it?"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Michael C.,"Clarkston, GA",10/25/2020,4.0,The set menu was very well done. The complementary shrimp that kicked off the meal was more heat with their hot sauce. The Star was definitely the soup. The flavors were amazing and complemented each ingredient. I would definitely return!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",10/16/2017,4.0,"I'm definitely a fan of this place, however the hesitant part for me is that I don't know if the food is worth the price. J C Holdway charges a pretty penny for their food and honestly even though it's tasty, I ask myself is it really worth it?We came here for a birthday celebration as this place has been on both of our lists to try for a while and this happened to be the perfect occasion to try out another restaurant in Knoxville. One thing I do like about this place over other ""high class/high priced"" restaurants in Knoxville is that they have a rotating menu meaning that my experience might not be the same for you in the next season. The interior is nice and definitely gives you a feel of a higher class place, however if you go on a Sunday you might see some UT fans go in there with shorts and UT shirts.This is what we ordered:Sweet and Spicy BBQ Ribs, peanuts & scallions; Slow Cooked Farm Egg, potato gnocchi, chicken confit & hen of the woods mushrooms; and, The Springer Mountain Wood Oven Roasted Chicken. I also got to try some other dishes that my friends ordered which were the hushpuppies, grits, and for the large plate the wood grilled pork.I thought the food was pretty good. The chicken is a half chicken, so if you're iffy on how much chicken it was well, there you go. We shared the half chicken and they plated it it as well. The problem with the dish for me was that the chicken was alright, and for a $24 dollar half chicken I was thinking more. I think the breast just came out dry and with no sauce and the soubise didn't really work out as something to make the dry meat easier to eat. I'm pretty discriminate against white meat, so that's absolutely no fault, but for the breast it's hard to cook it with it being succulent and juicy especially since it's also cooked in a wood fired oven.The Sweet and Spicy BBQ Ribs, priced at $11 for 3 pieces I thought was pricey, but it was more worth it than the $10 pork belly with biscuits, which by the way are bite sized biscuits and a little bit of pork belly. That just sounded insane to me. The ribs were pretty tasty and definitely the kick of the spiciness was there, but definitely was not overwhelming at all. The Slow Cooked Farm Egg dish was pretty good. The egg definitely was good as far as it oozed out when you popped it and it was perfectly cooked. I think this dish wasn't that bad and it's basically a sort of a soup that comes out, except it's not a typical soup. The gnocchi was tasty and flavorful, but there were only around 7-8 pieces.The other dishes I sampled were good as well. The Hushpuppies only had 4 pieces, and to me that was interesting because there would be no way I would have paid $1.5 for one of them as they were literally two bites. The flavor was definitely unexpected in a good way, but no matter what you do hushpuppies are just a hard sell for a pricey item. The grits were definitely plentiful for $14 it was a stretch, but it sort of falls on the same thing with the hushpuppies. Finally the wood grilled pork was pretty succulent as it melted in your mouth and I also thought the flavor was great. But again, I asked myself was it worth it?Overall, I think this place definitely prioritizes the display and atmosphere which makes sense! I mean, it's downtown, and presentation means a lot to patrons. To me, definitely a place to check out if you're wanting something new or have a special occasion. Service was wonderful, and so I'm definitely a fan here especially depending on why I'm here to eat. I look forward to what J C Holdway brings to the table for new seasons to come and definitely would recommend others to come here to eat."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Janeen S.,"Knoxville, TN",8/28/2021,3.0,"Am I the only person that is consistently underwhelmed here? Dinner here tonight was pretty good. Like it always is. Pretty. Good. Oysters were good. The bone marrow is far and away the best thing on the menu. Hush puppies are ok. Potato mash was gummy. Squid ink farfalle had decent flavor but arrived barely warm. Service was mediocre. This place could hit it out of the park, but always misses the mark."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Brett S.,"Iowa City, IA",5/25/2019,5.0,Incredible restaurant with incredible people.  While I was there they were serving a burger and it was incredible.  Served with onion rings.I had a wonderful time at the restaurant and ate at the bar.  The staff was friendly with me.I look forward to going back.  Incredible food.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Amanda S.,"St. Petersburg, FL",3/20/2017,5.0,"Happy Anniversary to us!!! We always like to go to amazing restaurants on our Anniversary. We spoil each other that way! Made reservations for 830. When we arrived we were seated right away. Our waiter was Cole and he was great! We shared the Grits and BBQ chips with smoked spread. Very good. Full of flavor! Seriously amazingFor our main Cory had the pork! Ugh it was so good and moist! Savory!!!I had the Gnocchi broth bowl. The flavor was out of this world. It was so good. I can not even describe it!We ran into a little bit of a issue with my food, but it was fixed and we received a free dessert!Chocolate and ice cream. Can't say no to that. The manager was very assertive and we were taken care.We can't wait to make another date night to have more yummy meals and tasty drinks!!! CHEERS!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Faith B.,"Milwaukee, WI",7/12/2018,4.0,"Before I visited J C Holdway, four people in my office told me it was Knoxville's best restaurant. That sets up certain expectations.The restaurant doesn't look like much from the sidewalk, but the eating area is modern/rustic chic.The service was excellent and our waitress kept our food and cocktails flowing steadily.I dined with a group of colleagues so we ordered a lot of things off the menu. We ordered all the appetizers. The carnivores said the ribs were awesome and the chicken wings were also quite good. The ubiquitous pimento cheese dip was fine - just as good as anywhere else, but not necessarily better. The hush puppies were wonderful - piping hot and comforting.For entrees, a few people ordered the steak, despite the $70 price tag. Our waitress did not explain that it served two people. Ah well. It was good, but not amazing according to my friend.I had the diver scallops small plate. It was good, solidly good, not amazing. I also ordered the roasted mushrooms and beets. Both sides were very tasty.I'm glad I got a chance to try J C Holdway. It was a very nice experience and I enjoyed it very much. I'm just not convinced it's Knoxville's best restaurant."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Angelique M.,"Kingston, TN",9/13/2019,5.0,"All I can say is WOW! I got the Wood Oven Roasted Chicken and my husband got the Wood Grilled Pork Tenderloin and they were both out of this world! Our friend got the Grilled New York Strip and he said it was one of the best steaks he's ever eaten. He lives in Atlanta and visits New York often. He knows good food. In fact he's the one who took us to JC Holdway. He said the Roasted Beet Salad was fabulous too. Now for the dessert. We all got the Goat Cheesecake with Peaches and Lemon Thyme Sorbet. Again, out of this world fantastic. The menu changes seasonally but after that meal I can't imagine they could do anything less than wonderful."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Diane Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",7/19/2018,4.0,Best restaurant in Knoxville. Try to get seats by the open kitchen area. Great wines and food.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jack J.,"Oakland, CA",10/17/2019,5.0,"Dope ass food coming out of this place. Service was spot on and friendly. Drinks well made with wine options many. Food though...was bananas! Shared 6 small plates between the 4 of us then one main each. Everything was just delicious. I had the ribeye with green beans, smoked potatoes, carrots all covered in a deliciously salty jus gravy. I'm lucky enough to eat a lot of good food around a lot of different places and this was exceptional. Oh - so - good!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Rochelle S.,"Las Vegas, NV",9/7/2020,5.0,We went again last week and the pre fixe menu was so good and was ALL gluten friendly!!!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Rochelle S.,"Las Vegas, NV",10/13/2017,5.0,I don't really like chicken I eat it but I don't love it.  I legit just had the best chicken of my life.  Do yourself a favor and order the Springer mountain wood oven roasted chicken. It's the best thing EVER!! Nothing was bad but that was heavenly.  If you like coffee the chocolate cake with coffee ice cream is also amazing.  You can't go wrong here even if you are gluten free like me!!  Also the cornbread is gluten free so there's that.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Justin H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/7/2017,3.0,"JC Holdway is a casual high-end restaurant operated by Chef Joseph Lenn.  I say ""casual"" high-end because the prices and menu are in the category of fine dining -- at least for Knoxville.  However, you could easily get by with coming in your jeans and athletic shoes.  Chef Lenn formerly headed up one of Blackberry Farm's (a ultra luxury resort in Walland, TN) restaurants and has all sorts of national accolades.  So, the place ought to be top notch.Based on some of the reviews here, the James Beard Best Chef award, and the Blackberry Farm pedigree, I expected JC Holdway to be the very best restaurant in Knoxville (if not more).  The critics have lavished this place with the highest of praise -- NY Times, GQ, and more.  So, why am I giving such a well regarded restaurant less than a 5 star?  Am I not savvy or cool enough to see the emperor's fine golden clothes?  Whatever the case may be and despite my humble credentials, here's my thoughts....My wife and I arrived on a Saturday night for a nice meal to celebrate my birthday.  I selected JC Holdway for this special occasion and was eager to try the food.  I'm the type of guy who loves flavor, spice, exotic, or deliciousness in any form.  If it's unusual, delicious, and I haven't had it before, I want to try it.  We ordered these small plates: (1) Slow Cooked Farm Egg, potato gnocchi, & hen of the woods mushrooms; (2) Bibb lettuce salad with Benton's bacon, pickled red onion, and buttermilk ranch dressing.  One Yelp reviewer recently raved about the slow cooked farm egg.  I am not sure what I am missing.  But, to me, it was a brothy mix containing a poached egg, small pieces of gnocchi, and some mushrooms.  It was just ""okay"" and, on a cold winter day in a snow covered cabin, it might fit the mood.  But, not under normal circumstances.The Bibb lettuce salad also was a disappointment.  Nothing special here.  I know it has ""magic"" Benton bacon.  But, seriously, it was just some lettuce, bacon bits, and dressing. Now, for the main courses, we had the wood grilled pork (with sweet potato, some sort of bbq porked cubes, and spices) and the Beef Coulette Steak (with squash, beets, onions).  Neither of our main course dishes were bad.  But, like the starters, they were unremarkable.  Very little seasoning, sauces, etc.  Also, the accompaniments were weak and did not pair particularly well with the entree.  No feeling of ""wow, this is am amazing flavor combination or presentation.""  The peculiar thing about the restaurant is the wood smoke theme.  JC Holdway smells like a BBQ pit restaurant and seems to pride itself on wood smoking most of the dishes (including veggies).  I ordered the mushroom and the okra sides.  Again, both were bland -- but had the wood smoke flavor.  As I consumed them, my mind drifted to the meal I once enjoyed at Kaizen.  By contrast, Kaizen had amazing flavor on its veggies (particularly the eggplant).  Here, the veggies were fresh.  But, that was the extent of it.I suppose that people from outside of the Southeast find the ""wood smoke"" theme to be unusual and cool.  Perhaps NYC doesn't have a lot of pit BBQ and it's just soooo crazy and original to see it in a place like this.  But, in Knoxville, it doesn't impress me.  If I wanted to smell wood smoke and eat next to a pile of wood logs, I'd eat at Calhouns or Full Service BBQ.  For the most part, I don't want that flavor in my high-end dining.  Also, the seating is not very good.  You are crammed in next to other tables and the ambiance is lacking.Unless things change, I boldly predict that JC Holdway isn't going to withstand the tough audience in Knoxville.  It's saving grace is that the entrees are generally pretty healthy and it has a well regarded chef.  But, that alone is not enough to bring me back."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Addy G.,"Queen Creek, AZ",3/3/2019,4.0,"I walked by JC Holdway on my first day in downtown Knoxville, and I thought the restaurant looked charming. It was during the day and the restaurant doesn't open up until about 5 PM, so I had to put a mental note to try to check that out while I was in town. I went by with one of my colleagues on a Friday night, and they said the restaurant was completely full. There were many empty tables but I'm assuming they were saved for reservations. The space is beautiful but it is on the smaller side, so I would definitely recommend making a reservation. The next night, it was 7 PM on a Saturday night which is prime time for dinner, I just got out of church and I was alone but I still wanted to check this place out. I popped my head in and Hannah, the hostess was so sweet. She noticed that I was by myself and she looked around and told me that there was a group leaving from the bar/chef's table shortly. She got my phone number and told me she would text me in less than a half an hour. I said ""that's totally fine,"" I left and walked around Market Square for a little while. It wasn't 15 minutes later that she texted me and I had a whole chefs bar almost to myself. It was a miracle! I pulled it off. I was approached right away by my server, Bonnie S. She was so sweet and had a conversation with me before she took my order. She welcomed me to the Knoxville area and more specifically to the restaurant. She explained the menu and how it's set up to order from each section: snack plate, small plate, and main course. She said you can definitely do whatever you want. She gave me her favorites and recommended a few plates. I started with a beet salad and then went with the oven roasted chicken. The beet salad was amazing and I got to watch the chef prepare it right in front of me. The cheese was absolutely delicious and the decoration was gorgeous. The chicken was very filling but chicken was perfectly cooked. Bonnie S told me that it would take an additional 10 to 15 minutes to come out because it is half of a chicken. I said ""no worries,"" as I was catching up with work on my phone. I loved the potatoes, but it did taste like they had a lot of butter in them. The vegetables were perfection, but I just wish there were more on the plate. The dessert menu looked delicious and I wished that I had room for it. Also, the cocktail, beer, and wine list looked great as well but I'm not one to drink by myself! If ever in the area again, I would love to go there. My first thought is how much my fiancé would like it here. There were people on dates, big family dinners, and celebrations happening. This is a perfect restaurant for just about anything. It's also a beautiful space for an event. There was a photo right by the kitchen of the man, JC Holdway explaining who he was which I thought was nice. I'm always interested in the history of a restaurant. When you walk in, they have some kind of scent that permeates through the restaurant and makes you feel hungry! The service was great. Shout out to Hannah and Bonnie S who made my experience lovely. I would definitely called this a Knoxville staple. if you're in town - check this out-and make a reservation, I lucked out."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Alan S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/10/2020,5.0,This place reminds me of eating in downtown NY city except more dining space to enjoy your meal. My experience was great and my date was impressed so what can I say but five stars to JC (LoL) !! and why compare Knoxville to NY city but you know what I mean nothing beats Knoxville. Give the sweets here a go all baked on location and the menu impresses.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Emily H.,"Atlanta, GA",7/31/2020,2.0,"Ordered a to-go chicken sandwich with fries and slaw. All of the food was put in the same small box. By the time I got home, the bottom of my sandwich was soaked in slaw juice. The chicken sandwich had a strange taste. Was not impressed. The fries were okay but were also wet from the slaw."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,George L.,"Knoxville, TN",2/17/2018,5.0,Excellent food the dry aged ribeye is excellent the springer mountain chicken wings are excellent and the pimento cheese is excellent nothing but spectacular tasty recommend to everyone who is coming to visjt Knoxville the mountain oven roasted chicken is moist not dry excellent Choice as well great atmosphere good spot
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Karen B.,"Las Vegas, NV",6/6/2019,5.0,"What a nice surprise!  I liked everything about this restaurant. The food was great and beautifully plated.  Service was wonderful, you have a great team!  Nice selection of wine and craft cocktails.  I was really impressed with the chefs flavor profiles and the way the menus were laid out.  We shared a bunch of small plates to get an idea of various offering, and had the pimento cheese and hush puppies from the small bites list , then enjoyed the grilled snap pea salad, party platter from the small plates list, and sides of puréed potatoes, and mushrooms.  Everything was delicious and went well with the bottle of Twisted Doero, a lovely Portuguese red blend that is available by the glass, and for a better deal buy the bottle.  Don't forget dessert...the homemade ice cream was  AMAZING we were served a scoop of salted caramel, vanilla, and brownie chunk. You all hit it out of the park tonight.  Well done...can't wait to come back...I think this is my new favorite restaurant in Knoxville"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Vanessa N.,"Norcross, GA",10/20/2017,3.0,"*3.5Knoxville does not have that many options for high-end restaurants, so this place is a good addition to downtown.  With the nice interior and friendly service, it is a decent place for date night or a celebration.   It has the price and the small portions of a high-end place but the food was maybe a bit too casual for high-end (hush puppies, grits, chicken wings, etc.)."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Holly R.,"Santa Rosa Beach, FL",2/13/2021,5.0,Incredible meal. The curated set menu was such a gift! We got to try things we never would have if it wouldn't of been set for us. Will be a customer for forever. Absolutely amazing!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Alli R.,"Asheville, NC",3/9/2019,4.0,"Wow! I was excited to try JC because I had heard their chef held the only James Beard nomination in Knoxville. I am so glad we made this our first stop, it was delightful! We sat at the bar and had excellent service, while being treated to watching the bartenders create their lovely craft cocktails. We had the Bees Knees, a yummy vodka, lemon and honey concoction, as well as the Manhattan which was stellar. We also opted for sharing some dishes from the snack menu, including the pork belly biscuits with jelly and pickles, as well as the smoked catfish and onion dip with housemade BBQ chips. The food was stellar! Definitely a new favorite!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Paisley T.,"Seattle, WA",3/19/2017,4.0,Absolutely phenomenal drinks. And I'm okay with the price tag. It's a straight $10 per drink right down the menu. And the liquor content is solid. My Bees Knees was just delicious. The food menu reads like a literature novel. Sigh. Sometimes I think Knoxville restaurants try too hard. You don't need a 2-line description to say you are serving up a biscuit or a bowl of soup. But the food is good. My kale and trout salad really delivered on the crunch factor. But although the garlic buttermilk dressing perfectly drenched the greens it altogether tasted too dry. I think some juicy fruit or maybe some beets would break up all the dryness and saltiness. But we are getting nitpicky. The service here is great and the vibe overall is way ahead of the Knoxville time zone.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Tiffany S.,"Acworth, GA",3/14/2019,5.0,"J.C. Holdway  (beet salad, buckwheat risotto, roasted mushrooms, cabbage & broccoli, and delicious coffee) Totally worth it & definitely one of the best vegan meals I've had."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/17/2017,3.0,"3.5* Worth the price? Eh. If you're looking for a restaurant to celebrate something important, I would come here because the service was phenomenal and our waiter was cute. ;) For a table of 3, we ordered: - Smoked catfish onion dip and bbq potato chips: the bbq chips were overseasoned. You will only taste the bbq spices. I had high expectations for this dip but unfortunately, it did not get close to meeting it. There were only a few pieces of catfish and the dip was similar to tartar sauce. - Geechie boy grits, benton's sausage, muddy pond songhum, hollandaise and wild ramps: this is the first time I enjoyed grits that wasn't cheesy. The grits were creamy and flavorful.- Scallion hush puppies and tartar sauce: my favorite dish. The hushpuppies were so soft, flavorful and not what I expected. There were 4 huge pieces and each bite was just delightful. I was surprised this was only $6. - Ricotta cavatelli, beef brisket, kale and mushroom: I felt like I was eating expensive tomato sauce pasta.  - Smoked North Carolina trout and kale salad: loved it! The kale had so many tiny crumbles of cornbread that gave the salad a great crunchy kick. There were a decent amount of catfish and I loved that the creamy garlic vinaigrette didn't drown the salad. - North Carolina catfish, sea island red peas, leeks, spaghetti squash: the catfish was cooked perfectly. If you are wondering what sea island red peas are, they are just red peas and you won't taste a difference. The spaghetti squash was hidden underneath the catfish. - Bellamy Blue cheesecake, strawberry, lemon-buttermilk sherbet, pecan vinaigrette: I ordered this because the pecan vinaigrette sounded cool but it barely made a difference. The sherbet was on the citrus-y sour side. The cheesecake was very soft. - Flour less valrhona chocolate cake, coffee ice cream, caramel and chocolate crumble: I enjoyed this more than I expected. The texture of the cake was so soft and rich. The pieces of crumble made this dessert even better. And to top that, coffee ice cream is a huge weakness of mine. I love the service and restaurant interior. The entire staff was very knowledgeable and if you ask about certain dishes on the menu, you will get a story!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jimmy B.,"Miami, FL",7/17/2019,4.0,"This is my favorite restaurant in Knoxville. Fresh local ingredients of very good quality. Federico our server was friendly and knowledgeable. The meal was more than good and flavorful in a contemporary decor. No fault, a must try."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Picky Eater A.,"Knoxville, TN",5/10/2020,5.0,"If you missed the Mother's Day take home special you missed a culinary treat....outstanding prime rib(with a rich gravy), potatoes scalloped to perfection, creamed kale that would bring out the country in you and a salad with pickled onion that complimented every course....and I have yet to dig into the pint of the chef's house made ice cream.  It was indeed a feast for at least four that would have made any mother happy!!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",1/15/2017,5.0,"Omg. 5 stars for the chocolate cake alone. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY? Other highlights: Chicken wings - the most fantastic smoky flavor, could have been meatier but delicious nonethelessHushpuppies - how is a hushpuppy this moist? I was in loveGrits - uniquely sweet. Really neat.Classic daiquiri - perfection ? I was sad I wasn't either of the geniuses who ordered itI would have a hard time not repeat ordering every one of those above items each return visit. I would skip the duck and pork dishes next time in favor of trying other things. I might go for the brisket cause our friends loved it. I also enjoyed the cornbread and I'm not even a southern cornbread person. If you are you will probably be super into it, as my co-diners were. Our server was adorably southern! We had a fantastic experience here. I 100% recommend you go."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Briana L.,"Maryville, TN",4/16/2019,5.0,"Such a great atmosphere! Absolutely love the cooking style and the food met, if not exceeded, my expectations. Great addition to downtown Knoxville! Can't wait to go back!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Iva C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/17/2017,3.0,"I was not too impressed with the food here. I found the food to be very pricey for the small portion sizes that they serve. The food was okay, but I was not blown away by it and I did not consider it to be worth the price. I will say the atmosphere is very comfortable and the overall feel of the restaurant is very pleasant. The restaurant seems well managed and the staff is very friendly. However, I was just not very impressed with the food here. There are many other restaurants I would rather go to for the next time I want a nice meal out."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,David L.,"Valparaiso, IN",12/17/2020,5.0,PF menu in place was outstanding.  I hope the chicken stew becomes a mainstay on the menu.  Look forward to returning when I'm back in Knoxville.  Only advice would be to turn down the lighting.  It's very bright.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Staria C.,"Nashville, TN",2/26/2019,5.0,Stopped in for a quick drink. The bartenders gave us some great advice on where to go. We just had just eaten but the food smelled amazing!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Brittany D.,"Brooklyn, NY",11/9/2018,5.0,"the service, the drinks, the food. everything about this place was incredible! I flew in from NYC and had a few hours to kill, got there at 5:30pm right when they opened and sat at the bar. Ordered the Blackberry Farm Fenceline which was delicious and the Pork Ribs & Mussels small plates. Both we're insanely flavorful. Great first experience in Knoxville! Would love to come back and try more!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Mike M.,"Raleigh, NC",6/29/2018,5.0,"Wow. Went here tonight with friends.  Great atmosphere, downtown Knoxville. Exceptional food.  Chicken wings, hush puppies, pimento cheese for appetizers. We had pork loin, hangar steak and buckwheat Risotto as entries.

j-c-holdway-knoxville,Shanna F.,"Crossville, TN",7/24/2019,5.0,"Wow! Yelp, once again, guided me to this gem. Wanted a new experience in downtown Knoxville to celebrate our 26th wedding anniversary. We chose the chef experience seating and were able to watch the chef and his staff prepare fresh culinary dishes. Our waiter, Federico, aka Fed, FedEx, Rico;) was beyond knowledgeable about every question we had, and poor guy, we had MANY questions. Fed guided us through an amazing food experience. We started with the pork belly biscuits and then added the chicken wings--both were amazing! My husband added the scallops with cucumber aioli and fresh heirloom tomatoes from the chef's garden. So good. I ordered the chanterelles with halibut (I can't tell you just how delicious it was!) My husband ordered the Springer Mountain chicken with potato purée, mushrooms, turnips, and gravy for his entree. Oh, and did I mention the cornbread served in a Le Creuset skillet with sorghum butter? Holy cow! Dessert was a salted caramel ice cream, compliments of the restaurant. Delectably creamy! Of course we added the cheesecake garnished with blueberries and lemon sorbet. Just incredibly creamy! My only regret is that I didn't take more pics!!!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Tiffany R.,"Bourbonnais, IL",7/11/2019,5.0,We found this place on a whim tucked away in downtown Knoxville. We were pleasantly surprised with our service. We ordered the steak for two. It was so fresh and very well prepared. Be prepared to pay! Quality food and service is worth the price.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,James G.,"Ballwin, MO",6/28/2019,1.0,Stopped in for a drink and more than half the bar had reserved signs.  I can't support any restaurant that allows people to reserve bar stools.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Wayne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",11/8/2016,5.0,"HOMECOMING DINNER I'd been away for two weeks so my wife had to figure out all her meals, a task I usually take on at least for dinner. So, she told me we were going out when I returned. Picked JCH and she was delighted. Started with pimento cheese with benne seed crackers for me. My wife had the scallion ""puppies"" and tartar sauce. Next came pumpkin soup, accented with a spoonful of Benton's bacon, pecans and preserved collard greens; red wine based beef, Geechie Boy grits and tomato gravy, all showered with a kicky shaved brussels sprouts, radish and mint; and roasted beets with pumpkin seeds and brown butter.The menu changes as often as daily, as a dish or two will migrate off and be replaced by one or two migrating on. Believe I could eat here daily, at least for awhile . . ."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Wayne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9/9/2016,5.0,"Well, it happened! J.C. Holdway, the eagerly awaited new restaurant with Joseph Lenn, the James Beard Award winning Best Chef of the Southeast in 2013 during his days Blackberry Farm, at the helm, opened, only to be closed, sadly, on it's second day because of a fire elsewhere in the building JCH occupies only a portion of. But, there's good news . . . this special, affordable soon-to-be red hot homey hotspot will open --again!-- next week.I was delighted and grateful to be one of the lucky diners who got to feast on numerous offerings on its intriguing menu full of seasonal, regional dishes cooked by wood fire. Offerings are organized by ""Bites,"" ""Tastes,"" ""Eats,"" ""Sides,"" ""Treats."" But even before those arrived, we were treated to tasty hush puppies. To my mind, shrimp and grits is a perfect dish for restaurant serving Southeastern food to have on its menu. Well, here, the juicy shrimp were hearth roasted perfectly (and sourced perfectly); the Geechie Boy Mill grits were from Edisto Island, S.C.,  and cooked perfectly; the accompanying andouille sausage couldn't have been tastier (so, sourced perfectly); the preserved tomatoes added a perfectly delightful zing; and the shellfish emulsion that floated over all was perfectly delightful. Chef Lenn has had to have been thinking for decades about how to source, cook, and serve this dish. It's a $14 meal in itself . . . and an astonishing one at that.True to a Southeastern menu were delicious and dainty pork belly biscuits with house bread and butter pickles with preserves. Two other ""Bites"" are grilled chicken wings with Alabama sauce and ember roasted ""lunch box"" peppers (I guess that might mean baby peppers since they were) with lime juice and sea salt. Those are for the next visit.There are five ""Tastes"" including the shrimp and grits. Terrifically appealing is the wood grilled trout salad, ribbons of zucchini, crumbled cornbread, and creamy garlic vinaigrette. Next time.There are also five ""Eats,"" the most expensive being the wood grilled Denver steak with potatoes, carrots, watercress, and creme fraiche, The four of us at our table tried the other four. Grilled North Carolina catfish, mighty tasty, with awfully good Carolina gold rice. Wood oven roasted oh-so-juicy 1/2 chicken (it had to be a 4-pounder and, as I understand it, brined for 24 hours) came with sweet and creamy creamed corn and fried okra. The wood grilled pork loin (dry, unfortunately, but that will surely be remedied quickly) and fabulous crispy pork shoulder were joined by crunchy and very nice sea island peas. I ordered last. My curiosity led me to toasted buckwheat grilled broccoli (looked broccolini), roasted baby carrots, and romesco sauce . . . a real delight and a surprise.We passed on all four ""Sides"" but not because we didn't want to taste them. Just seemed like too much food. Cornbread with Muddy Pond (Tenn.) sorghum butter. Cruze Farm (Knoxville) buttermilk potato puree with parsley butter. Grilled green beans with sorghum, soy, and benne (Southern . . . sesame seeds). Roasted beets with pecan butter. All next time.""Treats"" sounded fabulous but no room for them. Peanut brittle semifreddo, peaches, honey, and caramel corn. Lemon-buttermilk tart, blueberry jam, and vanilla creme fraiche. Olive & Sinclair (Nashville) chocolate cake, Cruze Farm coffee ice cream, and candied cocoa nibs. Next time.Indeed, there will be a next and a next and a next time in the short order until I've tried every dish on the menu. Come fall or winter, my guess is that Chef Lenn will change much of the menu but will bring a different magic to us all."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Wayne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",8/26/2016,5.0,"May open within couple weeks. Highly anticipated with Joseph Lenn, James Beard Award winning Best Chef of the Southeast while at Blackberry Farm, at the helm! The floor is done. The lighting is hung. The chairs have arrived. The tables have been assembled . . . by chef Lenn himself. And a sign is on the door!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Ed O.,"Sevierville, TN",8/15/2017,5.0,"Suddenly a new favorites appears. We came early on a busy Wednesday. It was fairly crowded with an after work crowd and, judging by the noise, everyone was enjoying themselves. We had reservations and were seated promptly. I liked the seating arrangements and the noise just added to the overall fun, casual atmosphere. Our waiter was quick and attentive the entire meal. We were happy with our drink selections, and we ordered a Smoked Catfish-Onion dip to share. It was hot, nicely seasoned and adequately sized for our party of three. We ordered 1. Geechie Boy Grits, hearth roasted shrimp, andouille sausage. 2. NC Catfish with herbed Fargo and grilled cabbage, and 3. Beef Coulotte Steak, fennel with patty pan squash and baby onions. For desert we enjoyed the lemon tart and Flourless Chocolate Cake. We were all impressed and vowed to return soon. (We have already made future reservations.)We found the prices on the high side of moderate, but a very good value for the quality of our meals. We appreciated the portion sizes not being gargantuan, so we left satisfied not stuffed."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Michael H.,"Ojai, CA",10/2/2020,1.0,"Absolutely horrible experience... we looked forward to this dinner our whole trip... they use a company called toast for their credit card transactions... we had five cards declined (even though the credit card companies had no record of the attempts and we could use them immediately after for parking fees).  We spent close to an hour trying to resolve it... luckily we had cash to pay the bill and we immediately left... maybe they don't care that it's only difficult for outside travelers during COVID? Not sure, but ruined our night... when COVID is over and I revert back to traveling 300 days a year, you can bet I will never be back here (and neither will any of the people who ask me for recommendations). No wonder they ask for your meal to be prepaid when you make a reservation!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",7/29/2017,3.0,"I really wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't buy into the hype. The portions are to small, the prices are to high, and we left hungry. I really wanted to like the food but we both just thought everything was a little bland. The chicken wings had good flavor, but the texture of the meat was weird and there was hardly any meat on each wing. I've spoken to some other friends that also felt underwhelmed, but then some of my friends love it. I guess it's just not what I'm into and you gotta try it for yourself."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Randy E.,"Nashville, TN",9/27/2017,5.0,"This restaurant is Knoxville's hidden gem. I was shocked to ask locals about it and they had no idea it existed. Reading the reviews here I realize the Knoxville clientele have no idea what they have in this culinary treasure. The very is EXTREMELY reasonable in price. The wine list is exquisite. Both times my wife and I had one of the best meals of our lives (and for me, an addicted foodie who has dined all over the world, that is saying a lot) with wine and both times we were out for under $100. The service is impeccable. Knowledgeable, team oriented, and hospitality reigns supreme. Danny Myer would be proud. And don't even get me started about Best Southeastern chef James Beard Award-winning Joseph Lenn. He is a culinary genius. Sourcing ingredients from local farms--he is able to create unique and delicious dishes. They are innovative yet accessible. On the smaller plate selections: The Slow Cooked Farm Egg with potato gnocchi, chicken confit and hen of the woods mushrooms is one of my top ten dishes EVER. I could have it a hundred times and never get enough. Oh. My. Joseph personally greeted us. He and his manager Micah create the consummate leadership team. And both times we had Maggie as our server. She is simply amazing. A professional in every way who created the perfect atmosphere for the reason you go out to eat. To have a magical evening. Highly recommended!!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Diana G.,"Knoxville, TN",3/30/2019,1.0,"We were sat around 7:30. We waited about 10 minutes for our server. Our wine and appetizers came within a timely manner. We waited 45+ mins for an entree that never came. While the table beside, who arrives 15 - 20mins after us, received their drinks, appetizers and entree's before us. By the this point,  we paid and walked out by 8:45. I would have understood if the kitchen was backed up but when the same table who has the same server as you gets their food before you, even though they arrive after you, it's very disappointing! This was the second time coming, first time was as horrible, but that time they just opened. Which was understand, but this time wasn't."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,James D.,"Lenoir City, TN",10/29/2017,3.0,"As we entered the eatery, the front desk was friendly.  The place smelled amazing. We went to the bar to sit and have a before dinner drink - the bartender didn't inform us there was an eating side and a drinking side, but we managed to figure that out.  The drinks weren't too bad but nothing to write home about.  As we made our way to our table, the smells and atmosphere had our interest.  The service was decent and the server friendly.  The snack plates were the best thing about the entire meal as the corn bread, wings and hush puppies melted in your mouth leaving you wanting to order more. For the main entre we waiting over 36 minutes.  For two medium rare steaks and a chicken.  Quite a long time.  Our plates were cold by the time the mail arrived and our steak was also Luke warm.  The potatoes were wrinkled looking as if they were left in the window waiting for someone to serve them.  We were hungry, so we ate it anyway.   Definitely no where near worth $67. After dinner we ordered coffees and deserts.  The French press takes well over ten minutes to make properly but was delivered to our table immediately.  Odd.  It was just ok.   The deserts left you lacking.  Our tart wasn't made properly and the raspberries were not fresh. All in all it was a good experience but we could have spent $300 on groceries and cooked a meal for four better than that. Ambiance 100% service 99% food 75%."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Rachel H.,"Los Angeles, CA",5/21/2018,3.0,"I was very excited to try this place, I had heard great things about it. It was hard to get a reservation for the day we wanted and ended up with a reservation late in the evening. The atmosphere is great, the design is sort of rustic but fancy and there is a view of the fire that they cook on. The menu is rather limited with just a few options under each category. I tried the roasted chicken which came with a mixture of different mushrooms and greens. The side items were delicious, the chicken, however, was dry and not sufficiently seasoned. The service was good, but I did feel like we were being rushed through the meal. Overall, my expectations were higher than the reality of this restaraunt."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Russ B.,"Charlotte, NC",9/7/2018,5.0,Service was excellent despite a very full house the night before a UT game.  The Old Fashioned was perfect - arugula salad excellent - seated quickly with no reservation.  Do it!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Sara L.,"Hopatcong, NJ",5/21/2019,5.0,"This place was amazing! Someone recommended this restaurant​ for a ""special"" night out while we were vacationing in Knoxville. It couldn't have been better-the food, the service, the ambiance was superb!​ It is a little pricey but definitely​ worth it!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Kirk R.,"Washington, DC",3/16/2019,5.0,We had a special event here. The Staff was great to work with and willing to accommodate our every need. The drink selection is top notch with a skilled group of bartenders that have great skill. The food is to die for the passion for the culinary history they are continuing shows through. A truly authentic experience and a must eat in Knoxville.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Michael H.,"Knoxville, TN",4/20/2019,5.0,"My wife and I celebrated our 23rd anniversary here. It was an exceptional meal. Our meal consisted of a bunch of snacks and small plates: pork belly biscuits, short ribs encrusted with peanuts, cheese grits, chicken wings, bone marrow with roasted broccolini, and a meat plate. For dessert, a peanut semifredo and strawberry panda cotta. Every bite was amazing. The service was incredible, and a ""happy anniversary"" card placed on the table when we arrived was a lovely touch. Highly recommend, and we'll be back."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Salmaan T.,"Washington, DC",7/8/2018,4.0,"Came here for dinner. Overall a 4 star experience. Service was excellent and friendly. Really appreciated that. There was six of us so we all kind of shared meals. Hanger steak, chicken, scallops, rissotto, catfish as mains. Veggies, pureed potatoes, pave potatoes and kale, beets, and a few other veggies as sides. The mains we're flavorful but I thought the sides were excellent. Veggies we're very flavorful and tasted incredibly fresh. I don't really care for mushrooms (I mean, it's a fungus, right?), but they were excellent. The sauce the mussels came in was fantastic. Could be it's own soup. Overall, a very nice experience, and we'll definitely be back."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Nancy H.,"Sevierville, TN",6/22/2018,5.0,Outstanding!  What a fun place to enigma y a delicious leisurely meal . Everything was spot on!  Sit at the bar to watch he chefs cook your meal.  Order the catfish dip and the potatoes are unbelievable!  Dessert was ooh la la!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,ashley s.,"Knoxville, TN",5/21/2017,4.0,"I really, really want to give this five stars but the initial service was disappointing. Hubs and I had reservations and were sat immediately. We waited and waited and waited.... literally at least five of the wait staff walked past us multiple times... not a single one of them offered to start our drink order or anything. It was almost as if we were invisible. Thankfully the hostess walked past about 18 min after we had been seated and finally fetched our waitress.  While I completely understand this may have been a fluke, I expected more out of a first time visit. We started with the hushpuppies and Kale and Trout Salad. The hushpuppies came out crispy and warm. The kale salad was very good with small pieces of deliciously smoked trout. I was disappointed there was not more trout on the salad, it was that good. Hubs had the Pork and I had slow cooked farm egg. We split the cornbread with sorghum butter. Hubs very much enjoyed his dish. Noting the pleasant saltiness of the pork. The slow cooked farm egg was absolutely phenomenal. I'm not sure what kind of sorcery makes an egg in broth taste so delicious but I inhaled it.   Hubs and I split the cornbread.  I very much enjoy fancied up breads, especially cornbread but this one was a little lackluster. I would likely skip it next time. We rounded out the meal with a cocktail and dessert. I enjoyed a Pimms cup, and we split the flourless chocolate cake with Cruze farm ice cream. Absolutely divine. Hubs said he only wanted a ""bite or two"" but could not put his fork down. We will likely return if only for the egg and cake."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Elsa C.,"New York, NY",10/29/2017,5.0,"Delicious meal, the restaurant is lovely. Good vibes, quiet. Must have starter: the wings, the white bbq sauce is amazing! Got the Steak for 2, highly recommend it! Cornbread as a side is a must! Also recommend all the veggie. Good cocktails and reasonable bottles."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Cory B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/1/2018,5.0,"Our experience was top notch.  We were seated right at our reservation time of 5:30.  Hostess was very friendly.  Server soon came buy for our drink orders and appetizer and soon followed up for appetizers.   My cocktail ""top down "" was very good.  We loved catfish dip and homemade chips for our appetizer.   Then for my entree I tired bone marrow for the first time.   I came with radishes, broccoli, and brioche.  My entree was amazing and I was very glad I tried the tasty bone marrow.  Also my wife's steak was very good.  We ended with the cheesecake which my wife usually is not a huge fan but she liked it quite a bit more than usual.  Overall outstanding so for the negative reviews i say at least give it a second try.  I highly recommend it."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Olga N.,"Knoxville, TN",1/11/2017,5.0,"Mr. Holdway, you're still a 5 in my book.  Ate a small-plates feast on the eve of a snowstorm this past week.  Yummies I devoured at the bar:Pork Belly & Biscuits with Bread and Butter Pickles & Preserves.I mean, hello, it's pork and biscuits, guys.  Of course it's wonderful. Scallion Hushpuppies & Tartar Sauce.Really light and crispy.  These went quickly.  Slow Cooked Farm Egg with Potato Gnocchi, Chicken Confit & Hen of the Woods Mushrooms.This was so comforting.  And, on the night before winter's first snow in East Tennessee, it was kind of perfect.  Diver Scallops with Celeriac Purée, Brussels Sprouts & (I believe) Clementine.  There was vanilla in the celeriac purée, which sounded horrific.  I'm happy to report it was delicious!  Just make sure you get a bite of all components.Milk Chocolate & Peanut Crunch with Caramel & Coffee Ice Cream.I still like the Chocolate Cake with Cruze Farm Cookies & Cream Ice Cream better, but this was really, really good.  Be careful with that peanut crunch-- you're just one wrong fork move from having it fly across the room!JC Holdway is always so warm, friendly and satisfying.  With any luck, I'll be back in two shakes of a pig's tail."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Olga N.,"Knoxville, TN",9/21/2016,5.0,"Holy Benton's Bacon, y'all!Like so many Knoxvillians, I have eagerly, some would say impatiently, waited for JC Holdway to open its doors.  This past Saturday, I got to eat my dreams.  We ordered the following: ""Uncle Joe's Party Plate"" (chicken liver pâté, I belieeeeve a country ham terrine and beef terrine, pickled okra and mustard)Wood Roasted Pork (with charred zucchini purée, sea island peas, wilted greens and pepper jam)Spring House Angus Beef (with potatoes, watercress, carrots and crème fraîche) Chocolate Cake (with Cruze Farm coffee ice cream and candied cocoa nibs).I won't break down every dish for fear of serving an injustice.  HOWEVER, I was making a lot of gleeful noises and faces throughout the meal.  Finesse is the word that comes to mind.  This is the meal you get from a James Beard award winner.  This is music on a plate.  The menu is full of simple foods that lean towards southern comfort, a nod to his roots personally and professionally.  The respect he has for food is apparent with each bite, and, in turn, bolsters my respect for his food.  His focus on ingredients and the expert balance in each dish set this restaurant apart from others in Knoxville.  Shoot-- maybe even the region.  Everything I had was perfect in preparation and proportion.  He's a magic maker.  I hate caramel (or at least I thought I did), but I'll be damned if I didn't devour every bit of it with my chocolate cake.  He makes eating exciting and surprising, and that's exactly what I want in my dining experiences.  I feel really bad for the reviewers who didn't get their food/had poor service.  My service was attentive, but perhaps they're still working out the kinks.  The food's so good, it would almost make bad service tolerable.  Fortunately for me, this wasn't my experience.  Can't wait to come back and spend too much money!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Ann R.,"Milwaukee, WI",12/3/2016,4.0,"Called early on a Friday for reservations and were told that they were basically full up for the evening, but we could come in and try the bar, which is first come first serve.  Good option for two!  No wait for spots at the bar and attentive service considering.A solid cocktail list with all the key players, and the menu reads like a foodie's dream.  The biggest drawback was two cocktails, one app, two entrees, and one side at $100.  The cocktails were spot on and reasonably priced ($10/each), but the food seemed priced a little high considering the portions are a bit on the small side and there's other upscale dining competition nearby.In no rush to go back, but it was worth visiting and is a nice add to the Market Square scene."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Kristin W.,"Savannah, GA",2/1/2018,4.0,Enjoyed a great evening in Knoxville at this restaurant.   Had a nice server who gave us a wonderful break down of the menu.   Had a fantastic octopus dish and some great local beers.   It is a beautiful space.  I definitely suggest checking it out!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,John Q.,"Charlotte, NC",9/14/2016,1.0,"Had a reservation. Ordered an appetizer, then patiently waited 2+ hours before cancelling our entree orders (something I've never done before). The restaurant was 80% empty at this point. They removed our entrees from the bill but still charged us for things (sides etc) we never received. We paid the bill and left without protest because we were headed elsewhere to finally get food at almost 10:00pm. They've only been open 2 days, the server was competent, but the kitchen simply couldn't put food on the table."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Alex G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/11/2018,5.0,"We couldn't decide what to eat... so we just ordered one of everything - and we are very happy we did.  The appetizers were very good and the side dishes were tremendous.  I especially loved the mushrooms.  For a main dish, the mussels were cooked perfectly and had a great flavor.  My wife enjoyed her kale salad very much.  The one egg was nice as well.  The Hanger Steak comes out medium rare so that means a little chewy.  It's nice but you just have to be sure that you are not afraid of that texture.  We were full but ordered our dessert to go.  Later in the evening, really enjoyed the lemon tart and that chocolate was very rich.  And you wouldn't expect cheeses to be a big dessert item but have to admit, there's a lot of flavor in there.  Only challenge is that the price can run up on you fairly fast but definitely plan on coming back again for more."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Timothy N.,"Knoxville, TN",11/2/2019,5.0,Had dinner here for the first time for a one year anniversary with the girlfriend and we had a great anniversary! The staff all love the food and get to try it so they know what they are talking about when asked. The trout dish came to another table and we saw how large it was so we decided to split it so we could try small plates as sides and everything was cooked to perfectly. The grilled vegetables were quality and flavorful. The trout was crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.The   Sommelier came over to help us pick a wine. He asked us what we wanted out of our pairing and then clearly and concisely made a few suggestions and explained why he picked them. We took one of his suggestions and it complemented our trout magnificently. We essentially had a three course meal complete with dessert and everything was made with care and intent. Can't speak highly enough of the staff and food. The menu is ever changing as they use ingredients locally sourced and in season to create dishes. A must try!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,LeaAnne O.,"Huntersville, NC",1/4/2020,5.0,Got a recommendation to come here for the farm to table and small plates.  We started with the starters of pork belly and biscuits and the ribs.  Both were amazing.  My favorite was the ribs that were perfectly cooked and a little spicy.  We had the beet salad and the wood oven chicken.  Chicken was smoky in flavor and amazing. Don't forget to order the mushrooms.  They were amazing
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Katharine D.,"Brooklyn, NY",11/24/2018,5.0,"Phenomenal. Get the scallops, definitely. Also loved the hush puppies and the flourless chocolate cake."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jared M.,"Madison, AL",9/19/2016,5.0,"Loved my first dinner at jc holdway for all the right reasons. First, they were kind enough to take a reservation for a group of 16, during their first week. Given that it was the first week, I figured the service and timing might not be spot-on, but.... Second, the service was outstanding. Attentive, but not doting or overbearing. We were never thirsty or hungry. And 14 entrees showed up together, in the space of about 90 seconds. Third, the food was incredible. The biscuits with pork belly, sweet pickles, and raspberry jam... those biscuits could stand on their own - a new best-biscuit-in-Knoxville champ. The pimento cheese. The hush puppies. Delicious variations (slight) on classics. And the shrimp & grits is on the menu as a ""taste"", but it's an ample portion and so rich and savory, it's a very satisfying meal all on its own. Pairing all of that with Blackberry Farm's saisons... so yum. I couldn't be more pleased with this Knoxville addition, and (fourth) in a beautiful space perfectly located just off Market Square. More of this, please."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Greg M.,"Knoxville, TN",11/23/2016,5.0,Fantastic food at upscale prices. The design of the restaurant is attractive industrial rustic chic. Huge windows. Our appetizer was barbecue chips with catfish and onion dip. Really. Sounds dumb but tastes terrific. My entree was roasted chicken. Extremely moist and flavorful. Possibly the best chicken I've ever had. Service is really slow. Relax and enjoy the evening.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Nancy S.,"Lakemont, GA",4/16/2017,5.0,"The best food I've eaten in a good long while. Our party of four included a chef who sets the food bar pretty high - and she was impressed. Started with the pimento cheese and homemade crackers. Great!I ordered the gnocchi with a soft egg - amazing - and the roasted mushrooms and snow peas (a side). My mouth was very happy! I got to taste other food around the table (friends generously shared bites) so I can personally attest that the roasted chicken, ramps and beets are all perfectly prepared - all creatively prepared and with a hint of smoke from their preparation. The table also ordered bone marrow and pork loin and raved. The chocolate cake was amazing in flavor and textures. If you're into creative food, get ye to J C Holdway. You will have a creative, delicious food experience."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Patrick W.,"Fayetteville, AR",3/20/2018,5.0,JC Holdway is a great dinner spot. We got the prime rib which came on a bed vegetables with crème fraîche. The prices aren't too bad for the upscale vibe and food. There's not a lot of seating inside so make sure that you have a dinner reservation. They have great seasonal specials and convenient parking at the market Square garage which is just across the street. Everyone in Knoxville should have dinner at JC Holdway once.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Rd M.,"Monona, WI",7/15/2017,5.0,"Fantastic restaurant in downtown. The chicken wings, kale salad, and steak are fantastic and the drinks are also very good. The wait staff is impeccable and the vibe inside the restaurant is very cool. I have been here four times and each time have eaten multiple things and have really loved all of. them."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Staci A.,"Paducah, KY",6/18/2017,4.0,"Very unique restaurant but in a good way. Menu is unique but delicious.   Great atmosphere.   Smoked fish dip , smoked chicken were very good!  Had pork belly for appetizers and was the least favorite  Will go back"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Rheannon M.,"Tampa Bay, FL",5/25/2018,4.0,"This is my second review of JC Holdway.  My husband and I went just for dessert and a cocktail.  We love the patio on warm summer nights and it didn't disappoint.  Our server was delightful and the cocktail my husband ordered (something to do with a ""thin mustache""?) was perfect.  However... I ordered the lemon tart and it was just. so. sweet.  I couldn't finish it.  I think a place the caliber of JC Holdway knows how to allow their quality ingredients shine and this dessert was so over sweetened that I couldn't taste lemon, or merengue, or the toasted marshmallow it was placed on.  Just SUGAR.  This was pretty disappointing because we came just for those two items.  I gave it four stars because the still believe in their ability to create quality food and we didn't have anything other than those two things tonight.  But if I didn't know better and had only this experience from which to draw, I would have only given three stars.  I still look forward to going back for dinner, but I will be asking about the sweetness level of dessert next time."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Rheannon M.,"Tampa Bay, FL",5/8/2018,5.0,"Top notch quality ingredients and excellence in preparation.  If you value either of those things, the price won't bother you.  :)"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Brad K.,"McGehee/Allendale, Montgomery, AL",9/7/2019,5.0,"I wandered into this place on a Saturday night and what a delight!  My wife and I were seated immediately and had great service led by Michael, but assisted by others.  The bartenders concocted a unique and wonderful beverage based on my description of drinks I have liked in the past.  The food was timely and delightful. I am looking forward to another meal here on my next trip to Knoxville."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Ian G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/4/2018,4.0,"This is a pretty restaurant, nice lines, classy modern industrial look, lots of light, big windows, etc. Sitting in the restaurant I was surprised how loud and noisy it was, although the restaurant was maybe 2/3 full. I tried many items on the menu. As far as the appetizers the scallops and barbecue ribs were very good. Too much fat on the pork biscuit for my tastes. Although the actual biscuit was tasty and baked to perfection. I also found the cornbread excellent. Clearly they have the baking end of things figured out because the couple of deserts we tried were also baked nicely and delicious. My actual pork loin meal was good but not great. It just wasn't very tasty but was lean and tender. The sweet potato that accompanied my loin was not appetizing at all. I'm ok with some vegetables being undercooked but potatos sweet or otherwise no. The farro on my plate also not very tasty. In summary high marks for anything baked and desserts plus some of the appetizers also very good. My actual entre and what else shared that plate was ok nothing special. Be careful if you make any modifications to anything you order because you're going to be charged for it and probably more than you expected.Considering the price I think my 4 star rating is generous and I'm rounding up a bit."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Meghan F.,"Knoxville, TN",1/18/2018,5.0,"Excellent restaurant, I am happy to find it! The quality of food was great, and the menu interesting. One member of our party thought her beets needed salt or more flavor but other than that everything was really really good. The cocktails, coffee and dessert were also really good and the ambiance of the place was very nice. I was surprised they don't have more signage outside, I am not sure what's up with that. The service was excellent and I'll definitely be back. The prices are a little high for Knoxville, worth it in my opinion and not all that bad but I can see where some people might find it expensive. You can see the prices on their menu online though, so you can judge for yourself if that's reasonable for you."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jamie L.,"Ferndale, MI",6/24/2018,5.0,"I am updating the review because I don't think I gave the restaurant enough credit the first time around. This time I avoided all the menu items that really seem like they are there because this restaurant is in the south. Don't get me wrong the hush puppies and biscuits and cornbread are good but the remaining items are more refined and have a lot more flavor. I could've eaten three of the snap pea salads by myself, so addicting. My favorite dinner is still the pork with fiddle ferns and ramps. It's this delicious mix of fat and pork and beans and green crunch that is so comforting but not one note. It's just a great restaurant."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jamie L.,"Ferndale, MI",4/19/2018,4.0,"The restaurant is so beautiful. Very nice atmosphere and great service. The food was good. Between four of us we shared four small plates, two larger plates and two desserts. The portions are on the smaller side. They had good drink selections and some affordable wines. I would not order the bone marrow again just because there was almost no bone marrow in it but the broccoli on top was good. The hanger steak was a great dish but the meat is very very rare and some people in our party were a little thrown off. My favorite was the pork loin and the lemon tart. Good location."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Janine A.,"Knoxville, TN",7/21/2018,5.0,"Had some really stellar dining experiences here. Don't expect to walk out under $75 if you're drinking but I will say the portions are generous, unique, and the service is great. We'll be back."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Anna D.,"Nashville, TN",6/8/2019,5.0,"Delicious food, great service, reasonable priced wine menu, and great atmosphere. They've won a James beard award which typically tells me the food will be wonderful without a stuffy environment and that's exactly what this place delivers. Some of our favorites include the pimento cheese dip, the vino verde wine by the bottle, and every entree - I think we've tried them all by now. Also-- the coffee liquor from Knox whiskey works is served here so an after dinner treat of coffee liquor with French press is a delight."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Cindy D.,"Knoxville, TN",3/19/2018,5.0,I not only love everything I've tried but the service was impeccable!! From the chicken wings to the roasted veggies and ribeye cooked to perfection. I will be back again and again. Thank you!!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Rich H.,"Knoxville, TN",11/19/2016,3.0,"Atmosphere was great, food was delicious. Reminded me of a meal you could get in Europe, including the portion. Let me state that it is embarrassing the food portions in American restaurants. It is no wonder America is overweight. However, while the food was delicious, portion sizes were more geared for a 10 year old......even in Europe. Even with a couple appetizers, I walked away wanting more on my main plate and went home and ate.I usually take into account the demographics that a restaurant caters to, and even as much as I enjoyed the food, the value for what I paid was off. For what I got, it was more of a meal that I could feel good about paying $70-$80 for the wife and I.........not $110."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Marjory R.,"Beverly, MA",8/21/2019,2.0,"The food was good.  Enjoyed the beet salad and mussels.  But, I did not see a single black person in the entire restaurant.  None of the customers.  And none of the workers.  It felt creepy to me by the time I left."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Adam P.,"Knoxville, TN",6/29/2017,1.0,"I debated giving the time to write this review. After hearing from multiple people who have had the same or a similar experience I feel that it is time to share my own.First I will start with what I liked. The wait staff was nice and timely with our orders. The restaurant was clean and had a pleasant atmosphere. For those things I believe JC Holdway deserves one star at least.Now for the bad. To put it simply all of the food was terrible. A restaurant can have the best service and atmosphere but when it falls flat on the food then all credibility is lost.I went to JC Holdway with 4 people, myself and 3 others. We ordered the chicken wings and the hushpuppies to start. Both of which where covered in salt. I decided to eat them anyway, we had been out all day and where extremely hungry. For our entrees we decided to try the steak dinner for two, it was praised as the best item on the menu. We ordered two, one for each group of two. When the steaks arrived I was shocked to see my steak precut, as any quality cook knows this to be poor presentation. I decided ""this must simply be the way they intended for the steak to be served even if I don't like it"". Then I ate the steak... The steak's charred exterior was covered in salt leaving nothing of the natural flavoring from the juices of the steak. I double checked the menu in case it had said the steak was supposed to be charred but found nothing to support that notion. When looking at the two steaks we ordered they appeared like they had been prepped by two different cooks with two different standards. One plate had more potatoes and the other more carrots. Luckly for myself and my partner we had a full steak. As for my companions their steak was at minimum fifty percent fat.The vegetables that came along with the steak where also covered in salt but absorbed it enough to still be edible. The entrees themselves, as they where to be shared, came in a large dish but we where provided no spoons or utensils to aid with moving the food from the dish to an individual's plate. (Here is the only point the wait staff let us down, we requested multiple times for two spoons but never received them). Unless it is the intention of the owner to have the customers pull one item out at a time with their fork, shared items should come with utensils to share the items (like deserts coming with multiple spoons).Myself, friends, and family all enjoy a evening out at a nice restaurant with quality food. I suggest that if you also like quality food to look else where. You will not find me at this establishment any time in the near future."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Amy L.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2018,5.0,"If you are looking for a place to celebrate an occasion or have a nice date night, JC Holdway will not disappoint! I have gone several times, and have been blown away by the dishes each time. It's refreshing because even though the food is high class, you don't have to be in black tie to feel comfortable there. They have the best orzo I have ever had! The cocktails are just as impressive as the food! Everything is definitely more on the more expensive side, but it is definitely worth it! I would never turn down an opportunity to dine there!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Didier O.,"Hagerstown, MD",5/2/2019,5.0,"Fantastic food and ambiance make this restaurant a delight! In addition, the waitstaff is courteous, helpful, friendly and professional. A memorable experience!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Miranda T.,"Morristown, TN",9/26/2018,4.0,"There was a lot of hype from my friends about JC Holdway so my boyfriend and I decided to go check it out. We called ahead for reservations and got them with no issue. When arriving I couldn't help but fall in love with the atmosphere of the restaurant, very contemporary and chic. The waitress was very attentive and sweet. We started with the cornbread and hushpuppies, both were yummy however I wish we would've gotten something other than both cornmeal based appetizers but that's what my boyfriend insisted on. We both ordered the hanger steak, it was cooked to perfection and came with potatoes and brussel sprouts which were both my favorite part of the meal. After we got the chocolate cake, it was quite good but I would've preferred vanilla ice cream over the coffee ice cream served with it. I also enjoyed a glass of Pinot noir and a martini while I was there and both were fairly pricy. Overall it was a fantastic experience."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Debra L.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",8/11/2018,1.0,This restaurant is  terrible. Service is good but the menu is questionable and far from upscale as suggested.   Will not give a good review to any one I speak to Hamburger was good but we were expecting a fantastic experience...Not here
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Todd G.,"Staffordsville, KY",1/6/2018,5.0,Fabulous! Such a good time. Service was Fantastic. We just walked in and sat at the wonderful bar- our preference.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Cliff G.,"Knoxville, TN",12/31/2017,5.0,"Excellent experience, wife and I shared the ribeye dinner for 2. Was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Will be coming back to try the scallops and the bone marrow dishes."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Mark N.,"Charlotte, NC",11/16/2017,4.0,The sides are the star at this restaurant. From the broccolini / cabbage / mushrooms dish to the buckwheat and course grits. Kale to collards. Really good flavor combinations. And don't miss the sweet potato tart.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Sheila W.,"Rockwood, TN",1/6/2018,3.0,"Just ok all around. I've concluded I'm not cool, as I'm not a fan of this new style and decor of restaurants. Jc's reminds me of a cafeteria, with its chrome and light wood. It's too cold, figuratively and literally.  The food was also just ok. I wanted more small plate options as Husband and I like to try a variety. Granted, my shellfish allergy was a limitation as they did have several options  with seafood.   Our very favorite was the cornbread lol true southern girl here! The sides of kale and broccoli were good, but again, not earth shattering.  The potato/leek side was very good but left for Husband as I preferred the cornbread.  Oh, the challenge of too many carbs. For us, will not return to jcs. There are other restaurants in the area we love.  I think we are not the age group jc Holdway is pursuing :-)"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Justin R.,"Durham, NC",2/26/2017,2.0,"I saw a feature of the chef on a local TV show and decided to check this place out. I would venture to say that is one of the nicer restaurants in Knoxville. Specializing in so-called ""New Southern Cuisine"" this place features trendy minimalist decor (which is almost out of style in other places) and wood-fired ovens to complete the urbane-rustic feel. I sat beside a stack of hickory wood used as a partition as I dined on the scallion hushpuppies (I sometimes have a hard time with unnecessarily descriptive names for regular stuff on menus in an effort to sound fancy). Anyway, the hushpuppies were...hushpuppies. Nothing special. For the main course I ordered the pork loin, which was cooked perfectly but otherwise lacking in flavor. It was accompanied by a lil portion of crispy pulled pork which was delicious. Farro cooked in a beurre blanc and sweet potato rounded out the plate. All-in-all, I have to say that I found the whole experience to be very...underwhelming. Nothing bad but nothing bold either; nothing out of the ordinary that couldn't be found in most Southern cities these days. As a diner, I'm really interested in the chef's culinary point-of-view. While I think I understood it in terms of the rustic-upscale feel, but was unable to pinpoint a strong sense of the chef in the food itself.Pros:Upscale dining in downtown Knoxvillepleasant atmosphere well-cooked foodCons:open floor plan (which means it was loud)food lacked substantial flavor"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Zack G.,"Knoxville, TN",11/12/2017,3.0,"The wife and I decided to try this out after seeing so much praise in the media.  Overall, the food was good and the service is above average.  Their hush puppies are very good.  Moist in the middle, crispy on the outside.  The pork belly biscuits are also delicious.  Where JC Holdway lost stars from me is on the entree.  We ordered the ribeye for two.  We ordered it medium rare and it came out very unevenly cooked.  The slices ranged from rare to well-done and the fat was not rendered.  Just a disappointing experience overall.  There are better options I'm town."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Cheryl S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/15/2016,1.0,"Our family ate here to celebrate our daughter's Birthday.  We were very disappointed !  First of all , it took over an hour and half after we ordered to get our food! When the meal finally did arrived, it was not hot, but lukewarm.  My husband ordered the chicken.  He was pleased with the taste, but they were extremely skimpy with the he accompanying side vegetables.Three of us ordered the catfish.  It tasted very fresh, but bland.  There also was only about a tablespoon of side vegetables.The portions of beef were also very small!  We were so excited from all of the ""press hype"" to eat here and left disappointed.Our daughter was not even offered a dessert for her Birthday!We have eaten at many fine restaurants all over the country and unless changes are made at this restaurant , we will not be coming back!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Nathan S.,"Santa Monica, CA",12/3/2017,5.0,"An exceptional southern dining experience. The service was excellent, but low key and friendly. The dishes were masterful, with a delightful use of local and classic southern ingredients. The menu blended together into one coherent culinary journey. Can't wait to go back."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Lisa M.,"Cincinnati, OH",7/8/2017,2.0,"Great atmosphere, but very disappointing food.  The Ribeye is WAY over priced. I was expecting an amazing experience given all the hype of Blackberry Farm. Really....just so so. The Ribeye was mostly fat.  The carrots, cauliflower and potatoes had pretty good flavor.  I also found it odd that there are very few vegetables on the menu. The appetizers seem so heavy they don't seem to mesh with the other courses. The bartender could probably use more training on how to make a dirty martini.  Also, I find it annoying that there are so few wines by the glass available.  The bottles of wine were extremely overpriced.  I know how much a bottle of Machete really is and it is not over $100!!I will say that the flourless chocolate cake was the best thing we had all night. We came home starving and wondered, what the heck we ate?  All around just not satisfied. I hope they can turn things around because I like the idea of them being here in Knoxville."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Steven A.,"Knoxville, TN",1/13/2019,3.0,The food was good but not great.  Honestly I wanted it to be better than it was.  It just wasn't memorable enough on any count to warrant the pricetag. The atmosphere is cool.  The drinks are expensive but fair for a higher end restaurant in Knox.  The large plate portions are an appropriate size but all the people in my party still left slightly hungry. It was not worth the $200 price tag for 2 people but I really wanted it to be.  Sadly we likely won't be back.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jon C.,"Knoxville, TN",10/13/2016,4.0,"Went last night with my wife and our 3 teenagers. The atmosphere was very welcoming as was our waitress Nicole. She was very knowledgeable and made some excellent recommendations.We shared several dishes including the wings, poached egg in mushroom sauce, pimento cheese, chicken pate, shrimp & grits. All of the dishes were delicious and well presented. Our kids were not as enthused as my wife and I so I would suggest keeping this more of an adult meal.We'll be back."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Amy B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/8/2017,5.0,"Wonderful! Delightful atmosphere, food and service       The cornbread was the best I've ever had. Highly recommend."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jon S.,"San Francisco, CA",1/20/2018,1.0,"Poor service, food not cooked to order, limited menu, and small portions.  All made for a bad meal."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Paul Y.,"Beaver Creek, CO",12/2/2017,3.0,Disappointing...  Had high hopes but it all fell short.  Nice staff and great friends was the high point of the night.  Bar service was poor and food was average. I probably wouldn't go back as it's not currently worth the wait.  Hope they can improve things.  I'd like to see if work as Knoxville needs new places to dine that aren't chain.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Sammy O.,"San Francisco, CA",11/16/2016,5.0,What a treat!! Great food awesome service!! The textures and combinations are delicious!! My fave the farm fresh egg and gnocchi!! Can not  wait to go back!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Tom N.,"Arlington, VA",8/27/2017,5.0,"Let's begin by appreciating their desire to source and keep everything local. From using local farmers to even supporting local businesses for ingredients, it was great to see this place truly embrace Knoxville. And the food? Wow. Forget about it. So good. The hush puppies were a great start and everything was seasoned and cooked flawlessly. So may different compositions of flavors and such a great atmosphere. An exceptional dining experience."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Kaila N.,"Arlington, VA",5/24/2017,5.0,"Review for Weeknight Dinner at the Bar I was in town for work from Washington, D.C. I was staying at The Oliver, and saw this place on the corner when I was first arriving at my hotel. I popped in for dinner on a nice, sunny Thursday evening. The dining room was packed, but the bar was practically empty. I ordered one of their cocktails (the name is failing me, but it had Gin, was light and springy and hit the spot) and per the suggestion of the bartender, ordered the burger with O Rings. Hands down, one of the BEST burgers I have ever had. I live in a city with burgers consistently on every 'Top Burger' list there is. The burger from J C Holdway still reigns supreme. The patties were thin, but not too thin and cooked perfectly- pink throughout, not red, not brown. The house mustard spread was the perfect flavor and amount. The bun was toasty, but not crunchy. This is important to note- you don't want crunch, you want that chew. And the O rings- whatever their secret recipe is for breading, it's working. Overall, should I find myself in Knoxville again, I will absolutely be coming back. In short- a very, good, simple burger. Nothing crazy, nothing fancy, just damn good eats."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,J F.,"Stuart, FL",3/2/2017,5.0,Yum! Hipster sort of craft bar kitchen. Excellent menu options whether you lean towards tapas or a full meal. The wood fired oven puts a crisp crust on everything from brisket to chicken.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Kelly W.,"Knoxville, TN",7/14/2017,3.0,"My husband and I had heard wonderful things about J.C. Holdway, so we were looking forward to trying it out. We both agree that food is good. The reason this restaurant deserves 3 stars is the service is so lacking which is a big part of the experience for us. Our waiter was not engaged, and he kept talking about how busy it was, yet every time we looked for him he was talking with another table. I would consider us to be very understanding and we wanted to spend time together so we didn't mind the slow service at first. Unfortunately for the price of the meal, we felt forgotten and had to keep asking for things like the check, extra water, etc. We will not be returning anytime soon because of the disappointing service."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Mark K.,"Dorchester, MA",5/9/2017,2.0,"Wow...disappointed in the food and recommended to me by a local. Main flavor in everything is salt. I like salted food but this is too much for me. Wood Grilled Pork was more fat than meat (No exaggeration). I'm not a big carb person and the amount of potatoes was very stingy for even me. Was looking for something green to accompany my meal and the greenest cooked item on the menu was mushrooms as is had a few pea pods. Presentation of both dishes was worthy of Olive Garden or myself when cooking at home and when I am lazy. Sorry.Staff is professional and means well, although the bar cannot keep up even though it was a quiet night at the restaurant. Everyone has an off day, so maybe you should balance this with the rave reviews...."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Michael R.,"Abingdon, VA",3/25/2017,4.0,I can take it it leave it. Food was very tasty all around the table.  Pricey. I guess keeps riff raff out.  Portions to small.  As I said good was tasty but not a good value but it is filled up at 630 so what do I  know
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Mark M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",9/20/2016,5.0,Loved this place.  Food was excellent; well prepared and well presented.  Ben and Anna at the bar gave u outstanding service and a lot of laughs. Will definitely tell all my friends to come here often.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jeff W.,"Seattle, WA",7/16/2017,5.0,"Good food, great wine (bottles of Gaja and Chave Hermitage!!). Relaxed atmosphere and fast, friendly service. We will be coming back."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Lady L.,"Louisville, TN",10/2/2016,2.0,"The food is not terrible, but it's not great either.  You're better off eating at your grandmother's table.  Service was mediocre at best, and the wine pours are small.  Only 5oz and glasses are about $10 a piece.  Most places have a 6oz pour.  If you're going to drop some cash on a meal in east TN, do yourself a favor and head to Foothills Milling Company instead.  I'm a little irritated that we did not, and sad that we spent iur hard earned money here.  Positive points... the atmosphere is cool and the location's proximity to Market Square is nice too."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Julie F.,"Knoxville, TN",3/3/2017,5.0,Third visit to this wonderful restaurant - we feel so fortunate it is here in Knoxville considering the talents of the chef and his team. Last visit we had the pimento cheese and hush puppies which were both perfection. Husband also shared wings with someone in our party and then had the roasted chicken with vegetables for his entree .... I had to try to cornbread with sorghum butter - it was all so delicious! The shrimp and grits was extremely flavorful as well. This visit we tried the smoked catfish with BBQ chips as an appetizer and the soft cooked egg gnocchi which my husband calls his new favorite. We shared the ribeye for two with vegetables - and you guessed it .... cornbread. All perfectly prepared and generous portions. Our new favorite restaurant in Knoxville - we recommend it highly!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,T W.,"Alexandria, VA",12/2/2018,5.0,I had one of the best meals I've had all year. Especially enjoyed the wings with white sauce and roasted chicken. The drinks are appetizing and atmosphere is very nice. Best place to eat in Knoxville.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Amanda B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/1/2017,3.0,"This was our first dining experience here, after passing it many times on our way downtown. The ambiance was wonderful, and the host welcomed us as soon as we walked in. We didn't have to wait long and were seated at a quaint table towards the back. We had the grilled Octopus as an appetizer, which was wonderful ($15 for one leg of octopus though... a little pricey.) For entrees, we decided to split the ribeye. This is the why I gave 3 stars instead of 5. We paid $69 for a ribeye with vegetables, which you're supposed to split between two. It's served on a large Le Creuset dish, and we were so excited until our server put it down. The steak itself is literally about 8 ounces. To split between two people, especially any man who enjoys a healthy sized ribeye... it was not enough. We were very disappointed at the price we paid, that we received such little meat. We basically paid $69 for maybe 8 ounces of meat, surrounded by marinated cauliflower and fingerling potatoes... the equivalent of a single serving. Uh, sorry, but I can get a better steak at Ruth's Chris for that much. The flavor in the steak was great, just EXTREMELY overpriced. We ended up paying around $200 overall, and my husband left saying he was still a little hungry... not good. Also, as I've read other reviews of this restaurant and seen what they've said, let me add on that we, also, had to ask for steak knives. Just a very disappointing experience all-together for a former Blackberry Farm chef."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Russ Y.,"Lafayette, CA",9/18/2018,5.0,"Loved this place. Crazy good smell of wood oven when you walk in.  Seated at bar looking at open kitchen.  Roasted Shrimp & Grits appetizer was amazing. Shrimp perfectly cooked. Hollandaise around the edges was rich, indulgent but not overly so.  Also ordered side of Wood Roasted Mushrooms, which also had some roasted cabbage and brocollini in it.  So good. Finished with best salted caramel ice cream ever; made in-house.  Walked out for $30 after tip. Server was super friendly and helpful. This place holds its own against anything in the Bay Area/Napa."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Troy P.,"Knoxville, TN",7/15/2017,3.0,"Disappointing. My wife and I had dinner here last night and were disappointed. We made reservations to sit at the chefs table, which is basically a bar top overlooking the kitchen. Ambiance of the place was different, which we liked. We were not greeted for about 5 mins, even though we sat 2 feet from the bartender and the app and dessert chef. Once the server did arrive the service was good, not great. We ordered 2 of their specialty cocktails, which were decent. We were also recommended the Chicken Wings to share as a small plate to get started. Not normally something I would regularly order, but they were great. I would highly recommend if you were to eat here. Then I had the main dish of grilled chicken and my wife had the flank steak. They were both average at best. First, if you are going to have an open kitchen concept restaurant, your game better be tight. This place feel short. We watched as they plated our food and the side vegetables were plated several minutes before the chicken and steak were ready and just sat there. Needless to say they were cold by the time they reached us. The chicken had decent flavor, but nothing I would order again. The steak although cooked perfectly the way we order it, medium, was lacking flavor and we didn't even finish it. To summarize, it's another new Knoxville restaurant trying to be different with a unique menu and local ingredients, which I appreciated, but came up short. Prices were a little higher than average, but nothing crazy. We checked the box and probably wouldn't return."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Bill L.,"Ridgefield, CT",11/10/2016,5.0,"Excellent food and amazing service. Great place to have a meal with great friends.  All plates small, eats and treats were all wonderful. 100% thumbs up!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Carrie M.,"Washington, DC",10/2/2016,5.0,This place is absolutely AMAZING!  Everything we ordered was perfection!  The staff were so friendly and knew the menu inside and out.  We can't wait to go back!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Vivian B.,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",4/9/2018,5.0,"When I die, bury me with a batch of their skillet cornbread. It is literally better than you can ever imagine and then some. Appetizers are more bomb than Baghdad. Trout dip is my personal fave and could heal any broken heart. Alabama white sauce wings are another list topper. As far as entrees you cannot beat the pork. Shrimp and grits are a close second. For dessert get the chocolate torte its rich and fudgey and you never want it to end. Everything here is incredible from the service to the trendy vibe. Great place for business dinners with out of town guests, birthdays, date nights, etc."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Monica C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/31/2017,5.0,"I went with a group of friends and truly enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I love Pinot Noir and they have two they sell by the glass. The first/least expensive one from New Zealand tasted like Chardonnay so select the other one. We started with snacks then moved on to small plates, larger plates, and of course dessert. We got the hush puppies, pork belly biscuits, pimento cheese, and Alabama white sauce chicken wings. The hush puppies were the very best I've ever had! It came with an onion glaze sauce that was very tasty. The wings were so delicious!! It's spicy with a taste of sweetness (kind of like very shuttle cinnamon). The pimento cheese and sesame seed crackers were the best in Knoxville! I don't eat pork belly but my friends raves about it. I wasn't impressed by my small plate: chicken confit, poached egg and gnocchi but it was a soup and I was surprised. The broth was yummy and that's about it. My husband ordered the octopus and he loved it. Most of the table ordered hanger steak which only comes medium rare. I enjoyed it but wished it could be medium. It was very red. The brussels sprouts were absolutely delicious! I know it's brussels sprouts but when you don't like them and they end up being your favorite food item you mention it. This is how they should be made for young kids and me! I need to figure about how to copy it. The dessert I chose was the flourless chocolate cake with coffee ice cream was top notch yumminess! Best flourless cake I've ever tried. For our next visit, I think we will repeat all the snacks we've tried, a side of Brussels sprouts and cake!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Bethany S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/11/2016,1.0,"While the atmosphere is beautiful and our server was great, the food was not very good and beyond overpriced.  2 mini pork biscuits for $10."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Chris S.,"Cordova, TN",2/15/2018,5.0,The food was excellent and the service exceeds all expectations! I recommend trying 3-4 small plates and splitting a main!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Christine E.,"Knoxville, TN",4/23/2017,5.0,Beautifully prepared locally sourced food. Relaxed dining atmosphere. Excellent dishes and great cocktails.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Molly J.,"Knoxville, TN",4/1/2018,3.0,"Great food (but expect small, nouveau cuisine size portions).  The venue is let down by the slow, disinterested service staff and the lack of atmosphere (bar lighting is particularly bright for a dinner venue vs breakfast venue).  The service level could not be more different to Blackberry Farm.  This place hits the spot on quality food but misses the mark on all else."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Leroy S.,"Knoxville, TN",6/22/2017,5.0,"Have been wanting to dine at JC Holdway for quite some time. We finally made it in to celebrate my birthday this week. It was a wonderful experience, my wife and mother both had the roasted chicken which they both loved. The potato purée with parsley butter and cornbread with sorghum butter tried to steal the show. My wife and I will be back for a date night to try the ribeye for two as the couples on either side of our table both had that for dinner."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Kathy S.,"Fairfield Glade, TN",10/1/2016,3.0,Food was good quality and interesting - just what I would expect from a chef from the Blackberry Farm.  We did wait a long time but the food made up for it.  The only problem was when we were seated I told our waiter that we needed 2 separate checks - when the bill came there was only 1 check and the waiter informed they have a 1 check per table policy so we had to start adding and subtracting which is very awkward.  Next time I will go to an establishment that will accommodate their patrons better.  There are lots of very fine restaurants now in Market Square that will give separate checks per tables.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Bryan W.,"Peoria, IL",11/27/2017,5.0,"Great meal. Chicken wing appetizer by far best wings I've ever had. Lamb dish excellent, and bites from others at table also great - octopus & roasted veggies especially. No complaints at the table, would eat here in a heartbeat. Food so much better than you'd expect in Knoxville if you haven't been to town in a while."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,JD C.,"Knoxville, TN",1/14/2017,4.0,"Our 1st visit to JC Holdway. Get reservations well in advance. The place is busy at the Bar, the Chef's Table (view into the open kitchen where you can watch up close the food prep), and the traditional dining space. Service was very friendly and informed. We noted in our reservation that one person was skipping gluten in their diet by choice. So the server pointed out the menu items that supported that desire with no prompting. We shared potato chips with catfish/onion dip, kale salad, fire roasted pork, and a semi freddo for dessert. All delicious. Food was a bit slow, but the restaurant was packed so it was understandable. They could consider a ""sharing"" option that other restaurants use. That is a ~$2-3 upcharge to split the portions in the kitchen instead of having the diners make a mess of things. Roy's in Hawaii has such a service and it is great. Also they should provide coasters with drinks as the cold drinks ""sweat"" and drip making the table tops/counter tops sloppy. Good experience generally. I figure that it will get better with age."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Madeline S.,"Knoxville, TN",7/26/2017,4.0,"Great service, but the food was very ""meh"" for the hype and price. I would recommend getting the rib eye and split it. The hush puppies are delicious!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Jennifer M.,"Nashville, TN",2/13/2017,2.0,"I called to make reservations for my friend's 40th birthday, and the girl was super nice. She asked if it was a special occasion, and I explained about the birthday and that it would be a party of five. She said they would make a big deal about the birthday when we came in for dinner. All of us ordered appetizers, a small course and an entree. We also ordered a bottle of wine. I brought a cake in for dessert, which the hostess saw when we walked in. Nothing was said about it. We ate our food, which was okay. Most if it was nothing to write home about, but I wouldn't say it was bad. When we brought the cake out and lit the candles, the server raced over and said with great attitude, ""There's a $25 cake cutting fee....is that alright?"" Well, no, actually it's not ok.....but what was I to do at that point but pay it as not to make a scene. Seriously? After us spending $300, you're going to tack on a cake cutting fee? On top of that, my friend's birthday was never even mentioned like they said they would. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because of how nice the person that took the reservation was. I promise you, JC Holdway, I will NEVER grace your doors again. That is no way to treat a customer!!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Zak S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/11/2016,2.0,"I've heard that there are issues with timing at this newest downtown restaurant, I happen to be one who can Confirm that. My wife and her brother both had the chicken, it was delicious, and it was hot, I had the Angus steak, I asked for medium, it was still medium rare, and it was as cold as the plate, and the potatoes that came with it along with the soggy greens, and the small smear on the side where actually colder than the plate, the potatoes were so cold they were actually hard already. The flavor was there but it was just not enjoyable because of the temperature. This is not the first time I've heard this, I can only hope that they get this worked out soon, Because with more than a couple bad reviews restaurants do not last long in Knoxville. Especially those on such prime real estate. Good luck kids!!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Lisa B.,"Carlsbad, CA",3/7/2017,5.0,"In town for business, I had an amazing dinner here this evening. I sat at the bar and enjoyed a Dark & Stormy with the pork belly sliders. They were very good, but I think I might be done with pork belly, mostly because of the name.  Following the sliders, I had the kale and smoked trout salad:  delicate flavors, which might be misconstrued for ""needs salt."" Or it might not be misconstrued that way. If you go, and you absolutely should, get the slow cooked egg in mushroom broth. Just do it. It was the best thing I've eaten in a long while. Really, it kind of ruined the rest for me. First world problem, I get it, but next time I'll just order two of the slow cooked eggs."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Becca M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/22/2017,5.0,"Really enjoyed dining here for our anniversary! Our server was very friendly and had some great recommendations. The food is among the best in Knoxville, but the service and atmosphere doesn't feel pretentious. Try the Carolina Gold dirty rice!"
j-c-holdway-knoxville,M H.,"Morrill, NE",11/28/2016,5.0,Best food in Knoxville bar none. Service worthy of a fancy Paris restaurant. Crafted food that is so complex. I am not a foodie but this place blew me away. I can only afford it twice a year but wow it's the best you can get!
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Mark D.,"Montgomery, AL",9/14/2016,4.0,"It was exciting to try J.C. Holdway on its second night. It's a great addition to the Market Square area. The ambiance, food, and service are great. Special thanks to Crystal who took great care of us. You can't go wrong with any of the ""bites,"" including the wings with Alabama white sauce, hush puppies, pimento cheese, and especially the pork belly biscuits. Several of my colleagues ordered the chicken which they liked but the Pork is the dish to order. It comes with a pork chop that is wonderfully seasoned and pork shoulder confit. The wine list needs a second look, however. The Côtes du Rhône left something to be desired. Overall, a great new experience."
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Janet P.,"Knoxville, TN",9/24/2016,5.0,Excellent food. The pork belly biscuit and the kale trout salad were our favorites. We got a lucky spot at the bar with no reservations.
j-c-holdway-knoxville,Susan R.,"Greeneville, TN",6/3/2018,5.0,"We ate at JC Holdway last night after reading reviews about the restaurant so we knew how noisy it was going to be. But, it was worth it for the food that we ate. We started with the scallion hush puppies that are served with a house made aioli. They were light, not greasy and really tasty. Next, we ate the grilled snap pea salad that had some preserved lemon in it; again, it was so good. We split the Wood Grilled Pork Loin and shoulder that is served with Sea Island red peas, fiddlehead fern, etc. and the side dish of wood roasted mushrooms, cabbage, and broccoli which, although it was not stated in the menu, had some type of acid (vinegar/lemon juice?) that balanced out the smokiness. Delicious. The shared plates came out already split onto two plates, which was super nice. We each had the flourless chocolate cake. I really have no complaints about the food and, despite the amount that we ate, neither of us felt uncomfortably full. It was hearty but not greasy and heavy tasting. They have an interesting wine list, as well."
emilia-knoxville,Nirra B.,"Miami, FL",7/28/2022,5.0,"Lovely dinner with a lovely service! In addition to the delicious food, thank you to our server John for making our experience even more enjoyable!P.S. Portions are small"
emilia-knoxville,Mai L.,"Denver, CO",8/27/2022,4.0,We didn't have a reservation but luckily were able to get in. We ordered bread to start that came with ricottaCheese with olive oil. Very good! We all ordered pasta dishes and it didn't take awhile but you can taste it's all very fresh. I ordered the fusilli carbonara which comes with the egg in the middle and you mix it. Very good. The bacon in it was tasty. My friend had gotten the bolognese and that was delicious. We all enjoyed our food. Service was a bit slow even though it wasn't busy in there. I waited awhile just to get a water refilled. I was impressed by the food which is why i gave 4 stars but it doesn't feeL welcoming there or we weren't thanked by the host when we left even though the stand is right in front of the door. I'd give 2 stars for service.
emilia-knoxville,Akinchita K.,"Temecula, CA",7/5/2022,5.0,Emilia is such a quaint and cozy place. It's perfect for an intimate dinner or date night. They are one of the better Italian places I have tried in Knoxville! I would recommend it to anyone looking for great food. We ordered the Fusilli and Campanelle con Funghi y Pinoli! Both were excellent! I really enjoyed the campanelle the pine nuts were an excellent added touch.
emilia-knoxville,Lisa M.,"Lafayette, LA",6/18/2022,4.0,Food quality is excellent here! Gluten free pasta choice. Please note it will be challenge if you are dairy free. I ordered the bolognese and it was very flavorful. My husband got the carbonara and added chicken. He loved it and rated his 5/5. Our friend ordered the gnocchi and enjoyed it but his portion was noticeably small. Customer service was excellent. Reservations are a must. We were able to grab patio seating. Quality and taste 5/5. 4/5 overall for portion sizes.
emilia-knoxville,Alex L.,"Las Vegas, NV",5/13/2022,5.0,"The service, food, and atmosphere was wonderful!The carbonara was very good, and the waitress was very knowledgeable on the wines!Would definitely visit here again on my next visit to Knoxville"
emilia-knoxville,Thuy Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",6/13/2022,4.0,"I'll say this up front. I don't crave pasta often and Italian cuisine isn't my favorite. With that being said, this spot was really delicious! It's adorable and cozy. A perfect spot for a nicer dinner or special occasion meal. My party of 3 ordered two pasta dishes and the pork Milanese, along with the artichoke appetizer, roasted beets, roasted carrots and focaccia.Everything was great- gnocchi was so pillowy and light, ragu was flavorful. Pork Milanese was good but a tad salty and I wish there would've been a little more sauce.Skip the focaccia, it was over toasted and really tore up the roof of our mouths. The beets were served cool, would've loved them to be warm. Carrots were so good!For dessert, skip the tiramisu. It's not the best I've had. The butterscotch pudding was INCREDIBLE.Overall, would recommend if you're looking for a nicer spot for a special meal or some great pasta."
emilia-knoxville,Brooke H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/14/2022,4.0,"Great meal and service!  We were able to get a table without a reservation right when they opened at 5pm, but we got lucky.  The place filled up fast so I recommend a reservation.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the decor was bland and felt a bit sterile."
emilia-knoxville,Shirlane C.,"Winchester, MA",9/19/2021,4.0,"Emilia. Wow. Let's talk about a restaurant that I would highly recommend to any pasta lover. Centrally located in heart of Market Square in downtown Knoxville, Emilia has ample indoor seating and just two tables out on their patio. I had the wonderful luck of securing one of those tables at 5:30 pm on a Friday evening. For those that are looking to dine on their patio - they don't take reservations for the space, its down to pure luck and timing. Each of their patio tables is covered by a large umbrella that provides shade from the setting sun. As I came here shortly after arriving in Knoxville, I just ordered a San Pellegrino - while it' not listed on the menu it is available for $4 (500 ml - medium glass bottle). In terms of food, I ordered the Spanish Octopus as my starter. The presentation was a little different from what I am normally served. It was already cut into bite sized pieces and served with arugula and a bean puree while paired nicely with the saltiness of the octopus. For my entree, I got the Fusilli Carbonara and wow did that deliver from both the flavor and texture fronts. It is topped with a poached egg that  creates a beautiful visual when the yolk is broken. The pasta is cooked more on the al dente side which creates a lovely bite. I did find the bacon to be on the tougher side so I left most of that on my plate. While you might find other reviewers mention that the portion was on the small side, I found that when paired with an appetizer and a side, it was a perfect size. In addition to my entree, I got a side of the beets and while they were delicious, I don't think they were that notable or breathtaking. It was well cooked and seasoned. They topped them with some roast pistachios which I thought was nice since it provided some textural relief from the natural mushiness of cooked beets. Overall, Emilia was a wonderful experience and I would encourage you to visit if you are in the area."
emilia-knoxville,Joe K.,"Cleveland, TN",7/27/2022,5.0,Great food. Nice ambiance. Fantastic selection of Italian wines. Very good for celiac allergies. They know what they are doing. Love the food. Been there twice and I'll be back.
emilia-knoxville,Dave C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/30/2022,5.0,"Growing up in and Italian family and then moving to TN was a bit of a shock.  And then we found Emilia!  We've been a dozen times over the past few years and the worst part has been trying to decide between the Bolognese, Carbonara, and the Gnocchi - all of which are fantastic!The wait staff are great - very friendly and attentive - and the food is always delicious.  So glad to have a place like this nearby!"
emilia-knoxville,Kathleen Z.,"Flemington, NJ",2/6/2022,5.0,"Started with the pulled mozzarella. While delicious, I think they slightly missed the mark as burratta would have been a better choice with the accompaniments. The bucatini carbonara was perfection. The Cardedu orange wine was a fabulous accompaniment. It gave just the right acidic balance for this dish. I had the fusilli carbonara and it was perfection! My husband had gnocchi frutti de mares and it was an 8/10. Only an 8 because it needed more gnocchi. Flavor was great!Our server Becca was awesome!"
emilia-knoxville,Nicole H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/7/2021,3.0,"We had a decent birthday dinner here but there was a few things that made it not-so-great. The whole restaurant smelled like a backed up toilet. It made eating a bit gross. We almost left actually. I was also pretty turned off by the fact our server was wearing a crop top. When she stood next to the table for our orders or checking in on us her bare stomach was in our face. Not professional at all. I'm not excited about staring at your bear stomach when you're taking my order. The food was good, but not over the top spectacular.  It was reallu authentic though and food came quick. My Fiance' loved his gnocchi and my carbonera was good (although the 6 tiny pieces of bacon felt like it was lacking in quantity there), but the overly casual environment and smelly restaurant experience means I'm doubting we'll be back."
emilia-knoxville,Andrea B.,"MI, MI",7/10/2022,1.0,"Super disappointed. The food was ok at best. Husband ordered the cavatelli. The pasta was a joke, literally pea sized and so few pieces. It was mostly broth and a few pieces of white fish. I ordered the market place steak, it was mediocre at best. No sear. To make matters worse, the staff was cold and super unfriendly. I ordered a rose with dinner and it never came, the waitress never even asked if I wanted a beverage, and obviously forgot my request.  We seemed to be a bother to her. Would not recommend at all. Over priced for poor service and mediocre food."
emilia-knoxville,Michael S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/3/2021,5.0,"I've been wanting to go here for years - and was so excited when a group of friends mentioned going after hearing nothing but good things about the place.

I got the Fusilli Carbonara - it was incredible: a dash of pepper and a little smokey (probably the type of bacon).Had a few beers on tap - and I got a refreshing Highland IPA; it tasted great. Finally, would highly recommend getting the Warm Paysan Focaccia for the table - their bread is delicious!"
emilia-knoxville,Jordan M.,"FL, FL",8/20/2022,5.0,Fantastic food and drinks! Always will go out of my way for some of their homemade focaccia bread.
emilia-knoxville,Ben W.,"Knoxville, TN",12/28/2020,4.0,"I'm updating my review, since I returned after a 2 year hiatus from a poor experience. This visit, the service was great and the food was wonderful. We had a few great antipasti items. The warm focaccia bread served with ricotta is very good. The roasted beets with pistachios were my wife's favorite. The show stopper for me was the house pulled burrata served over sweet potatoes. Simply amazing. For the main pasta dishes, we had fuscilli carbonara and orchiette with ragu alla bolognese. Both were very good and the pasta was perfectly prepared. We were full, so we skipped dessert. Overall, this was a  wry nice return to Emilia"
emilia-knoxville,Ben W.,"Knoxville, TN",4/1/2018,2.0,"Poor customer service while having dinner at the bar. Food was decent, although portions are small."
emilia-knoxville,Macy D.,"TN, TN",6/14/2021,5.0,"My boyfriend took me here for a Saturday date in market square, and it was so so nice! I had never been before but had heard great things. He raved about the charred Caesar salad (I thought ours was TOO charred, but maybe we were just an outlier that instance). I absolutely loved my fusilli carbonara..although I felt the portion could've been a little larger (looks huge in the photo but the dish is very shallow). My boyfriend ordered the pollo al mattone and it was amazing!! Huge portion and the chicken was so tender and flavorful. We also got a carafe of the house red wine which was delicious and totaled to around 6-7 glasses between the two of us. It is a small restaurant and is very simply decorated, and feels like you're taking a step into Italy! Would definitely come back for another meal, wine, and would love to try the dessert menu next time!"
emilia-knoxville,Justin A.,"Perth, United Kingdom",7/14/2022,5.0,Particularly enjoyed the artichoke fritti. Lots of locally sourced ingredients - right down to the Fanatically Blonde Knoxville lager. Good service too.

emilia-knoxville,Alexis B.,"Baltimore, MD",4/19/2021,3.0,"I wanted to love Emilia - I'd been looking forward to a meal there for a while - but I was a bit underwhelmed unfortunately. We were in Knoxville for a day of hiking this past weekend, and we decided to order a meal from Emilia online and enjoy it outside due to COVID. Market Square was way too crowded and nuts, so we just walked up to the courtyard with picnic tables at the TVA campus just up the hill from Market Square. Ordering was really easy, and our food was ready on time. We did have to request silverware since we were planning out eating it outside, but we noticed it before we left Market Square and just popped back in for it. We started with the artichoke fritti (crispy artichoke fritters with lemon and caper aioli), which were good but not great - a little too doughy for me (more artichoke, less batter for me). We also shared the grilled romaine heart (with Parmigiano-Reggiano, herbed bread crumbs, and traditional Caesar dressing), which I enjoyed! After that, we shared a side of the roasted beets with pistachio butter (with white balsamic vinegar and toasted pistachios), which I didn't love (to me the pistachio butter was so heavy on the beets and too sweet; I love beets, but this preparation just wasn't for me). Lastly we got the polenta and meatballs pomodoro, which was almost great! I thought the meatballs were really good (not dry), and I thought the polenta had amazing texture (so silky smooth), but I thought the dish was underseasoned (I think the polenta and the tomato sauce could have used more salt/seasoning). Since we ate our meal so close by, everything stayed really crispy and fresh in the takeout containers. If you don't want to dine indoors yet, takeout is definitely a good option. They do have curbside pickup (they explain how to call) if you're in a car (we walked so we just popped inside to get our food). They are seating indoors, too (as of April 2021 when we went), if that's the option you prefer. Overall, it was an okay meal. It has a really interesting menu, and I imagine the location is really fun and convenient during non-COVID times (being on Market Square). I wasn't blown away by the food unfortunately. But given the interesting menu, I'd definitely be willing to try it again and maybe change my mind. Unfortunately, this first visit just didn't really hit the mark for us."
emilia-knoxville,Ramón A.,"Austin, TX",6/2/2021,5.0,"The staff was flexible with me in securing floral arrangements to celebrate a birthday.They really made it feel effortless.As for the food, it's a real effort to find good Italian outside of metro US areas,especially in the southeast. Here, I felt confident enough from seeing photos and what was coming out of the kitchen to order most of what was on the menu for our party. Would absolutely order everything again with the exception of the carrots."

I was really impressed with the whole dining experience! The atmosphere and decor is cozy and modern! Everything you order here is made from scratch, and with love!  We ordered the House Pulled Brattain to start, then I ordered the Polenta and Meatballs Pompdoro for my mains, and then had the Toasted Pistachio Gelato to round out the meal. Everything I had was on point. I will be returning here in the future! If you really love quality Italian food, this is a great place to spend an evening with someone special!"
emilia-knoxville,Kelly H.,"Charlotte, NC",9/15/2021,5.0,Delicious Italian in a cozy atmosphere.  I don't miss out on it when I'm in Knoxville.
emilia-knoxville,Kassi S.,"Knoxville, TN",9/4/2021,3.0,"Went here last night, the food was good but not a ton of options because one of my kids has a pork allergy and almost every dish had pork or seafood in it. The food is excellent but the portions are a bit small. When we walked in the restaurant had just opened for the evening, they asked if we had a reservation which we didn't but it was literally empty, there was not one other person there. They sat us at the worst possible table, a highboy which chairs were incredibly uncomfortable and we were right in the front window. I would rather have sat outside I think or put me in the back I did not like that table at all I kept feeling like the chair would tip over at any moment. The food was tasty but my husband finished his so quickly that I was really surprised at how small his plate was."
emilia-knoxville,Jeff H.,"Clovis, CA",9/2/2021,5.0,"Everyone was very nice...hostess, Justin our waiter and other servers who helped.  The food was delicious!  Seafood, meatballs, olives, beet salad, artichoke hearts....yum!Very nice atmosphere as well!  Quite delightful for our first visit!"
emilia-knoxville,J W.,"New Boston, Huron Charter Township, MI",8/8/2021,4.0,Excellent food and solid service. The market area has great people watching. Prices are on par for the area but high in general.
emilia-knoxville,Courtney K.,"Carmel, IN",10/23/2020,3.0,"I wished I could rate this higher but I just can't. We went with a bachelorette party, which I know can annoy some people, but we weren't loud and all only had one glass of wine. We were starving but this place doesn't even have bread to start with! So we begrudgingly paid for focaccia, which was cold and dense... not great. I ordered the Pinot for wine and they brought me house wine. It was corrected but the waitress didn't seem happy about it. I shared the special truffle risotto and gnocchi with a friend because they both sounded so good, but just ehh. I couldn't believe how expensive the risotto was too! Ahh killed the vibe on mediocre food. The gnocchi itself was good, but several of us felt the sauce was a little too spicy and it was hard to even taste the gnocchi. The ambiance was nice and most of the people were nice too. Our table we reserved was ready right when we walked in. During Covid, everyone wore a mask. I don't know, we came from out of town and were just kinda disappointed, especially because it was pricey. I don't think I'd be back unfortunately."

emilia-knoxville,Lana B.,"Knoxville, TN",10/8/2020,4.0,"A fresh look for a Knoxville eatery, with a well-conceived delicious menu that includes vegan and celiac-friendly (ie gluten-free) options, derived largely from local farms. We will return!First visit for a special occasion. Used Open Table to reserve a 7 pm table for two. We were seated immediately near the door so we could see Market Square through the large front windows, hear the subtle alternative music blend, and enjoy the basic ambiance. We started with a Lechtaler pinot noir (the wine list is exclusively Italian) and the featured Pear Bellini. The bellini was smooth and flavorful, with pear puree and chamomile-infused bitters. It would be easy to drink a few of these!The Crispy Local Eggplant appetizer turned out to be our favorite dish; the kind of thing you can't perfect at home. The balance of honey, burrata, and prosciutto atop the crispy rice-battered eggplant slices was divine.My partner opted for the Orecchiette with Ragu alla Bolognese (pasta with meaty tomato sauce). While delicious and filling, it was over-salted. The combination of pork, beef and veal delivered a complex and satisfyingly meaty goodness.Planning to eat multiple courses, I requested the Young Arugula Salad as an entree with a medium-rare salmon filet. It was lighter, but the truffle oil in the dressing somehow added a bit of weight, whereas more lemon juice would have elevated the dish. They nailed the salmon, though, bringing me a crispy-skinned slab, still nearly raw in the middle (just the way I requested it!)We finished with two Dolci options. The Butterscotch Budini had all the right elements, but they just didn't play well together. The butterscotch pudding was overpowered by the salted caramel (honestly overcooked into nearly a toffee), and the coarse salt atop the freshly whipped cream was about twice the amount needed. I really wanted to love the Vanilla Bean Panna Cotta. The citrus confiture was wonderfully tangy and sour and sweet all at once; I love when citrus is celebrated!  However, the panna cotta was not set, behaving more like a cup of partially cooked egg white. And its vanilla flavor contrasted with the citrus more like drinking orange juice while eating a bowl of cereal... not good. The macaroons were sweet and heavy, so I finished just one, ate all of the citrus, and left the panna cotta for the kitchen to post-mortem.Overall, we enjoyed the meal and will return. There were several dishes on the menu that tempted us, and with such respect for celiac-friendly options, this store is worth supporting."
emilia-knoxville,deb r.,"Naperville, IL",3/5/2022,2.0,This was a disappointment.  The food was decent but incredibly small portions (literally appetizer size) for the amount charged. EVERYTHING is an upcharge.  Our waitress described how great the bread is so we ordered it...which was basically the kind of bread any decent Italian restaurant would bring you at not charge extra.  I ordered a martini and asked for olives ...$2 upcharge.  Way over priced and impersonal.  Would not go back.
emilia-knoxville,Rose K.,"San Diego, CA",3/25/2021,5.0,"I don't even remotely have enough positive things to say about Emilia!First thing: Service is FAST. I've waited in longer Dunkin drive thru lines than here!Second thing: For Olive Garden prices, you're getting amazing hand crafted pasta dishes with fresh local ingredients. (The wine per glass is pricey, but enjoyable.)Third: This food, I had no idea that Italian food was THIS. We get so caught up in ""What's for dinner? Italian? Are we doing spaghetti sauce or alfredo?"" Man I can't even explain how nourishing and delicious this meal was.We had: The burrata appetizer with squash- OH MAN. I've just never had anything like this. The texture of the ricotta inside was phenomenal.Focaccia and ricotta- so warm and crispy!Campanelle- technically a vegan option, but you would never know it. This dish blew my mind. I took one bite and told my husband we need to try to make this at home. The pine nuts and broccolini and mushrooms were just phenomenal.Carbonara- can be intimidating to look at a runny egg on top, but after you stir it in the dish, you're left with this amazing creamy dish. I thought it tasted like an elevated Mac and cheese. (Sorry, that doesn't sound too elegant lol) there's an extremely smoky bacon in it, and it's a very strong flavor. I preferred the Campanella over the carbonara but my husband felt the opposite.I also had the grapefruit Prosecco cocktail- it was fine, but a little ""herby"" tasting for me. There was a glass of wine that I never heard of- fiano- and it was much more to my liking.Do yourself a favor and try this place out!"
emilia-knoxville,Martha L.,"Mount Airy, MD",7/20/2021,1.0,"We had driven from Lake Norris and were looking forward to a nice Family dinner at Emilia's Unfortunately we were all very disappointed with the food it was awful.Five of us had ordered the Cavatelli frutti di mare -This dish was boiled pasta with boiled shrimps, mussels and fish with a watery tomato sauce with no taste at all, not even a hint of salt!! The octopus appetizer was over cooked, rubbery to be more exact.After I could not eat this meal I requested to speak to the manager to let him know we were very pleased with the server a very nice young lady but the food was just not good.The manager named Keith was also not very helpful.Our bill was over $600.00 and I was expecting at least to have an apology.I suggest if you're looking for a good Italian restaurant go elsewhere. This Restaurant may have been good in the past but not anymore."
emilia-knoxville,Sarah B.,"Rocky Top, TN",4/1/2022,3.0,"I doubt we will return to this restaurant.  We didn't have a reservation but many tables open when we got there.  And, when we left there were still several tables available.  We were put in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen.  We were also offered the bar.  The food was good but not delicious.  Both of ordered a pasta selection.  Mine wasn't seasoned and only had about 12 tiny pieces of pasta.  We have had much better.  The service was excellent which is why I gave it 3 stars.  Here is another restaurant that charges for the bread!  REALLY!."
emilia-knoxville,Kris C.,"Nashville, TN",7/11/2021,4.0,"Quaint modern atmosphere. Starters were amazing! We had the romaine heart and the artichoke frittas. We should have ordered these as our meal instead of sharing. So good! The wine was excellent too. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the wine. Our pasta, mushroom one, was fine but not amazing. Butter with focaccia was good as well. Waiter was personable and started out strong but didn't come back check on us until we were finished with our meal."

emilia-knoxville,Bridget J.,"Murfreesboro, TN",10/19/2020,1.0,"Honestly, I was debating between 1-2 stars, but it was so legitimately bad I went with one. My husband and I were on our honeymoon and this visit left a bad taste in our mouth.To start with, we were given warm tap water right from the faucet. I understand not having ice is the new thing right now, but warm water is a little too off track for a place that charges these prices. Next, the waitress said the special incredibly fast and quietly, ending with ""Buuuut it's $32 soooooo..."" which was weird and a little rude. Granted, We were wearing street clothes, so maybe we didn't look like we could afford a $32 entree, but so were the servers and half of the other patrons so I don't know why we were treated differently?Next, the food. I love Italian food, fancy or not, but when you charge $20 for a bowl of what honest to god tasted like bad Hamburger Helper, you need to reevaluate your menu. The gnocchi was good, but the orecchiette dish was laughably bad.We were going to order dessert, but our server clunked our check down on the table and flounced away, saying ""Bye! Thanks!"" over her shoulder as she went back to the server stand. We ended up getting milkshakes elsewhere.All in all, pretty disappointing."
emilia-knoxville,Candi M.,"Raleigh, NC",11/9/2019,4.0,"This place was jumping on a busy Friday night in downtown Knoxville. Make a reservation!  Our waitress wasn't the best & started by saying there was a Red Wine Special which she didn't describe & said to begin with the starters as they were ""very shareable"". Um OK. I had the Fusilli Carbonara and cannot even begin to describe how divine it was-from the creamy farm fresh egg to the gigantic chunks of bacon, it was a heavenly dish. Husband had the Orecchiette Bolognese. He loved it. We also started with the Buratta which was creamy and came with croutons& roasted squash & apples. Delish combo. Please do not visit this restaurant & not order the homemade pasta!!!!"
emilia-knoxville,Mike K.,"Sunbury, OH",9/26/2019,3.0,"I was really disappointed... this place Yelps really good but my experience was not that. It could have had something to do with the waiter (Killian, like the beer) - I can't remember last time I got that little service in a restaurant but putting that aside. The food was good but not great. I really can't believe an Italian restaurant that does not serve any type of bread. I had a pasta dish with an egg and bacon which was rather small portion.  I liked the coke in the small bottle and the decor. The service was really bad and the food was not great. There are a bunch of other restaurants on the square that have better food and I think they all have better service. NOT WORTH THE TRIP."
emilia-knoxville,Bob S.,"Wexford, PA",11/15/2021,3.0,"Food was great, but the staff needs to drop their 'attitude'. Restaurants are trying recover, and those fortunate to be working should be more grateful."
emilia-knoxville,Regina S.,"Edgewater, MD",10/28/2018,4.0,"Four and a half really.  I love being surprised by an unexpected food creation and Emilia's managed to do it in spades.  We were on a long road trip and decided to actually enjoy a nice meal out rather than ordering in and eating our meal on a hotel bed.  Their location on the pedestrian only square was welcoming and bustling with energy.  Inside, the restaurant was removed from any noise or crowds.  It was a welcoming atmosphere, but not overly decorated.We started with splitting the grilled wine marinated Spanish Octopus.  I have never had such tender meat.  The cannellini and olive oil purée served as the perfect base.  Creamy, luscious but light enough to elevate the seafood rather than compete with it.  The crema and olives were also appropriate Mediterranean ingredients to accompany the dish.  The best thing?  The chick pea croutons.  Just wow.  Could have eaten a whole bowl of these nuggets and frankly, have absolutely NO idea how they made them.My partner went for the Cobia special of the night, and I couldn't refuse the house made pasta ""orecchiette with Ragu alla bolognese"".  When the entrees arrived, my companions plate looked beautiful - a thick glistening white piece of fish cradled on a bed of over the top creamy mashed potatoes and dotted with giant fried capers. The Cobia was perfectly cooked, tender, silky and full,of flavor. The mash was well seasoned and so smooth you could almost drink it.My dish looked more rustic, as expected.  The ragu with local beef, pork, veal, San Marzano tomatoes and Pecorino Romano, was understated, but excellent. The ""little ears"" were perfectly al dente, with an extra chew you only find with fresh pasta.  The more I ate the more I appreciated the homey, woodsy flavors that developed.  The dish was well balanced, no floating pasta in sauce that you find in other Italian eateries that claim to serve authentic cuisine from that region.  Portion size?  Perfect and generous.  If you are expecting a pound of noodles as your dish, this isn't Olive Garden.  Our side of garlic grilled broccolini was our only hiccup.  The side arrived lukewarm and we exchanged it for a fresher, hotter serving.  Loved this place!  Definitely stop by if you are in the area.  It's worth every penny and calorie."
emilia-knoxville,Morgan D.,"Mentor, OH",3/13/2021,2.0,"If I was giving a rating based on the food I would 100% give 5 stars - so definitely recommend for really good Italian. However, there's a lot more that goes into a 5 star restaurant aside from the food. The service experience from the start was poor. My fiancé, brother, his girlfriend and I all came in for dinner and when walking in we had our masks fully covering our face but the hostess wasn't satisfied with the way we had them on so she made a comment and then was incredibly rude and rolled her eyes when I told her the way I was wearing the mask was correct. It then took about 30 mins before we were given any bread or appetizers and they charged $1.50 for olive oil instead of butter for the bread... I'm totally fine with enforcing rules but at least be kind and treat your customers with respect. If it was my restaurant the hostess would be fired after that experience."
emilia-knoxville,Jennifer N.,"Miami, FL",5/7/2021,5.0,"Stopped in on a Friday and was able to snag a table when someone reserved but did not show. Loved the spaced tables in this quaint farmhouse feel little spot. I had the burrata salad and it was made with tasty greens, peas, and a purée. I really enjoyed it. The waitress suggested a lovely wine and we had mussels and homemade pasta that was comfort food delicious! It was also quiet and relaxing there and as a family is was nice to enjoy food and conversation. I would visit again for sure!"
emilia-knoxville,Melissa J.,"Lake Zurich, IL",3/26/2018,5.0,"We loved our meal and thought the prices were more than reasonable for the quality of food and service. They had a very nice cocktail list, we tried the Amica (very similar if not the same as a Negroni), an Italian Daiquiri, and a Black Manhattan and all were very well made cocktails. Food was delicious! We started with olives, roasted beets (very generous portion), and Broccolini. For my entree I got the Polenta and Pomodoro with Meatballs and the meatballs were outstanding, very nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly. My fiancé ordered the Pasta Carbonara and loved it, so did I after taking a few bites.We debated between one or two desserts and I am so glad we went with two. The caramelized milk jam that came with the semifreddo was my favorite bite of the night... I could have eaten a whole bowl of it! Service was on point as well.  We had a reservation and were seated right away by a very pleasant hostess. Our server had great timing, there when you were ready to order, etc but not overly present. Staff did a great job of clearing dishes in a timely manner and owner/manger was present on the floor to oversee everything.Highly recommend Emilia!!!"
emilia-knoxville,Judy M.,"Whitestone, NY",5/1/2021,5.0,"This was probably the most amazing meal I have ever had. How can I say that? My qualifications include being aNYer, Italian by marriage, vegetarian and Covid skittish bc hubs died from it a year ago This food was spectacular even as take out. Wish I lived here so I could get it regularly. Kudos Emilia."
emilia-knoxville,Suzanne D.,"Saint Louis, MO",9/7/2017,4.0,"I went into Emilia on a recommendation of a couple I met at another nearby restaurant the evening before.  They spoke highly of the food and the wine list.The build out of Emilia is beautiful.  It was busy, but wasn't so loud as that you could not have a conversation. I sat at the bar as I was dining alone.  My bartender was attentive and helpful and made several great menu recommendations.  I had the roasted chicken and potatoes and it was amazing.  The chicken was flavorful, tender and juicy.  The potatoes also had a great flavor.  The portion size was satisfying--so much so that I wouldn't have been able to finish if I had ordered a salad or starter.  While the dessert list looked amazing, I did not get the opportunity to try anything.While I found the wine list just so-so, the amaro selection was outstanding! And moreover my bartender was knowledge about the digestif. I will definitely be back at Emilia on my next Knoxville visit."
emilia-knoxville,Kevin J.,"Knoxville, TN",3/19/2022,1.0,"Food was good but the own was a total ass. We asked to switch tables because it was under a air vent blasting cold air. One member of our party has a medical condition that can cause health issues quickly if exposed to cold temperatures. We explained this but the owner said no absolutely not. The restaurant was at 20% capacity because it had just opened. So there were tons of open tables, the same size as our table, that he could've moved us to. He claimed they were all reserved but I checked online & they still had openings for them. He was super rude about the whole thing. And there were still open tables, as well as reservations, when we left. He never came over to apologize for the inconvenience or even check on us during our meal. Won't not recommend this place to anyone. There is better food in Knoxville with much nicer friendly management. Some friendly business to the owner, don't be a dick to your customer."
emilia-knoxville,David F.,"Nashville, TN",1/1/2019,3.0,"This is a very popular restaurant. We read the reviews and decided the 90 minute wait for a meal was, therefore, justified.We were seated very close to people on either side of us. We felt it was a bit too close and were restricted in our conversation. The other concern about the seating is that it is hard. Hard seats, hard benches and small tables. If you plan to spend any amount of time here you will end up with a sore backside.Then there is the music. On this night it was simply terrible. It's intrusive, manufactured, repetitive electronic garbage.So to the food. I ordered octopus as an appetizer. My wife ordered roasted romaine salad. They were both nice. For a main course I ordered bolognaise, which was reasonable but not as good as the price would have suggested. My wife ordered a ribeye which looked good, but was lacking in taste.We finished with Panna Cotta (nice) and chocolate torte (nice, but tiny). The service was good.Overall, we were less than impressed. Prosecco at $12 for a small flute was way over the top and the final bill at almost $150 was about twice as much as it was really worth.This is a very ordinary restaurant. Given the choice in central Knoxville, we probably won't return."
emilia-knoxville,Mitch C.,"Maryville, TN",12/5/2020,1.0,"Please don't waste your time and money with this place. Especially not for cold, over priced chef boyardee. The waitress was extremely rude. The manager wasn't much better. They messed up 3 of our bills over charging us for alcohol and it took them forever to straighten it out. They were slow to take our order. They bread that came out with the mussels was burnt, the water that was served was warm, the food didn't taste fresh and hot, plus the service was terrible. I would have much rather ate at the Olive Garden.   I just checked my bank statement and they ran my card twice last night! PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE!!"
emilia-knoxville,Paisley T.,"Seattle, WA",3/18/2017,4.0,"The bucatini is the chef's favorite and it's five-stars delicious! The sauce is absolutely amazing. The best red sauce I have ever had in Knoxville. And I don't bring out the superlatives for nothing. For that reason alone we'll give Emilia a bunch of yelp stars. Besides that, I'm kind of let down by Emilia's. The warm olives weren't good in my opinion. Meh. And it's great and all that they make pasta noodles in house, but they seem to have a texture problem. What do I mean? The bucatini noodles tasted really chewy and the gnocchi was really gummy and tiny and itty bitty. Actually, the gnocchi was disappointing. It tasted like paprika. Yeah, order the gnocchi and you'll get gummy paprika bites. Pretty much. The affogato inverso was weird but fine. Service at the bar could be better. Prices are a little high. Except for the bucatini. That merits the price tag. Good stuff."
emilia-knoxville,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",1/26/2017,4.0,"Came here for dinner under reservations with an Italian stallion. We ordered the lump crab and heirloom squash agnostic which was the BOMB! I wasn't expecting this flavor or texture at all! It's sort of like a ravioli but not sealed. The stuffing was super creamy and flavorful. The crab pieces were a great protein topping.  Roasted sustainable salmon: more protein! Great sized entree with healthy sides. The fish wasn't dry nor bland. Genovesse style fishermen stew: you will be hungry if this is your main dish but it's perfect for portion control! I wasn't too impressed with this - it was basically assorted seafood with what is most similar to marina sauce. I had to end with dessert! We ordered the tiramisu and panna cotta. I'm usually not a fan of panna cotta but I have to give them props for making me enjoy it. The texture is similar to jello so it waas quite refreshing. The tiramisu was on the bitter side which I extremely appreciated. It was still sweet as it it as dessert, but the flavor was bitter if that makes sense. I ate 3/4 of both desserts...they were served in cups so yeah for portion control! We stayed there until closing just chatting it up and they still serve you after your meal! His coffee and my water cup kept getting filled and they don't rush you to leave! I loved the spacious layout and the customer service was spectacular. Great date meal but might be a tad on the pricey side. As for portions, it varies on what you order but for 2 people, 1 shared starter is sufficient with individual entrees and dessert."
emilia-knoxville,Eleni P.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",8/8/2021,5.0,"Dinner at Emilia was wonderful! Coming from downtown Chicago, my expectations for food are exceptionally high, but Emilia did not disappoint! Everything we ordered was clean, simple, and well-done. The waitress, Nina, was kind, courteous, and super thorough. Going to restaurants can be a nightmare due to my severe dairy allergy and Nina made sure that I could enjoy anything on the menu with accommodations, of course. Located in downtown Knoxville, this spot is definitely a little gem!! If we're ever back in town, we will definitely come back. Thanks again for the great food and great service."
emilia-knoxville,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",2/8/2017,3.0,"Came here with dinner reservations as I've heard that this place was always packed when we walked by it.  Walking inside, we were seated quickly and got our menus. I thought that the service wasn't bad, considering that it was literally packed. The restaurant is definitely a big room, and there's nothing to soak sound in.  So you can imagine, a lot of people with just concrete floor/walls... it's going to be loud. Let's get to the food. There is no pasta menu on their website, as I believe that menu changes constantly, so if you're wondering about the menu keep that in mind.  I came here during December, but haven't gotten to this review until now.  We ordered the salt cod bandade which I thought wasn't bad as it was nice and creamy and it worked with the bread. However, we had a problem with the amount of bread as it wasn't enough to eat all the salt cod. It came out in the form of a spread so basically you could dip or what we did which was just spread right on the bread.For pasta, I can't remember the dish names, however let's just say I wasn't impressed with the price of the pasta. The amount of the dish along with the price tag just didn't match. Why? The pasta dish reminded me something from hamburger helper. I finished, however the memory of eating hamburger helper was renewed.However, the dessert was good. I thought that was what sort of won me over with the rating. I would have definitely given 2 stars if I just had my entree of pasta. However, the appetizer and dessert was great. We ordered and shared the Affagato Inverso, and we liked it! I mean, you can't go wrong with coffee ice cream.Overall, it's not bad, but it's not the best Italian restaurant I've had. The price is probably not worth the food, so I would probably recommend to check out another Italian restaurant in this price range."
emilia-knoxville,Emily C.,"Sterling, VA",2/16/2021,5.0,"Enjoyed a lovely meal with my husband and our daughter on a recent trip to Knoxville. Wish we had known about this restaurant before! Loved it. Very hip, cozy atmosphere, helpful, friendly staff, and wonderful, authentic Italian dishes. We thoroughly enjoyed our two appetizers: the artichoke fritti and the warm olives. Loved them both! Very flavorful and the olives were so yummy - they were warm and infused with the brine they were served with. Our main courses were all fabulous as well. My husband had the Polenta and Meatballs, our daughter had the Fusilli Carbonara and I had the cavatelli ai Frutti di Mare. All were fabulous. Will definitely go next time we are in town."
emilia-knoxville,Erika M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/28/2016,4.0,"All I can say is that it's about time we have a solid Italian restaurant downtown!   From the moment I walked in the restaurant, I knew that this was right.  The staff is attentive and accommodating.  The feel of the restaurant is clean and simple, and the design feels like home.  Considering that everything is made in-house (including and especially the pasta), the menu is the perfect size.  It's not overwhelming, but there is no shortage of options.  I cannot seem to make it to Emilia without ordering their foccacia with whipped ricotta.  They change the menu with the seasons, and it never disappoints.  I love, love, love their ravioli.  They are little pillows filled with heavenly goodness! The superstar on their dessert menu is the ricotta donuts with blood orange curd and dark chocolate.  They are incredible and worth the extra calories.  The other items on the dessert menu are good, but not great.  They are all things that are made and plated ahead of time, like tiramisu.  They're fine, but I'd much rather save the room in my belly for fresh, delicious pasta, bread, and wine."
emilia-knoxville,J W.,"New Boston, Huron Charter Township, MI",8/8/2021,4.0,Excellent food and solid service. The market area has great people watching. Prices are on par for the area but high in general.
emilia-knoxville,Nicole L.,"Decatur, GA",9/24/2019,5.0,"Woah.Exceeded my expectations for sure. The broccolini was so flavorful and cooked PERFECTLY. I'm a stickler on this one, and I'm not kidding.. nice crunch, amazing char, seasoning is beyond. Bolognese is insane. Pasta cooked PERFECTLY, and while rustic and somewhat understated appearance, absolutely delish. Butterscotch pudding, my god. Just eat here. I'm serious."
emilia-knoxville,Tammy C.,"Buford, GA",4/10/2021,1.0,"They will seat you, feed you, take your money and then accost you and literally bully you to walk to restroom or out with your mask on. I am fine with masking when it makes sense but their virtue signaling is sickening."
emilia-knoxville,Kristen T.,"San Francisco, CA",1/3/2021,5.0,"The food here is so amazing.  We stayed down town overnight and needed to grab food to go that would be a crowd pleaser.  We ordered the spaghetti, gnocchi and carbonara - all were excellent... although the gnocchi was my favorite.  Best I've had.  Food was wrapped well, quickly prepared and host staff was friendly and helpful.  Portions seemed small at first, but in reality we were only able to finish about half of our dishes so ended up being the perfect serving!"
emilia-knoxville,Melanie M.,"Chattanooga, TN",8/10/2018,5.0,"This was authentic and greatness at its finest! From the service to the food, it was. VIP experience. The freshness of the food was so delicious. I splurged on dessert and am glad I did! I don't want to write too much, because this is something that should be experienced first hand. It's just delightful."
emilia-knoxville,Chris A.,"Iredell County, NC",7/30/2019,3.0,"First time here and probably my only time. Let me get the fact that the food we ordered was very tasty. The pasta is house made daily and the ingredients are local. I have no complaint about the quality of the food. My criticisms would be the seating and the extremely limited menu. We were flanked on both sides by other parties not 30"" away. There was no booth seating available. Some folks may like the whole, ""Let's all just be one happy family with strangers"" but not at the prices here.As far as the menu... what Italian restaurant doesn't offer classic spaghetti and meatballs? No Chicken Parmesan? No Veal Scallopini? No Chicken Marsala? Oh well, you win some you lose some."
emilia-knoxville,Beth M.,"Cincinnati, OH",5/27/2021,5.0,"really great food, moderately priced, high quality, good portions. Tried the carbonara and pork milanese, 8/10 and 10/10 respectively. must try!"
emilia-knoxville,Steve A.,"Asheville, NC",5/2/2018,5.0,"Incredible!  One of my favorite dinners to date.  At 60, I've had quite a few.Forget any review that claimed portions were small, without saying anything disparaging about the individuals writing that, I'm not sure how anyone would or could consider the portions small; they were appropriately sized and it's not the Olive Garden.  Equally, disregard or certainly discount any negative reviews.  Those people must have been coming down with the flu and their taste buds had gone wacky.If we lived in Knoxville, it would be our go to restaurant.  Exceptional, interesting and incredibly tasty menu options.  To start we had the artichoke fritti - fun, light and enjoyed the complimenting sauce.  Next, we ordered the AMAZING beets w/ pistachio butter (vegan) to accompany the broccillini, salmon and gnocchi. OMG, it was like what the food in Heaven will know doubt taste like.  LOVED it all.  My husband doesn't like beets and he too thought they were incredible.We were there at 7:00 on Sunday evening, had made reservations and got seated right away.  It was perfect, not busy, not noisy.  Lovely Emily was our sweet waitress.  Very attentive to our every need and had great suggestions.Oh, Steve is lactose intolerant so I didn't try the butterscotch pudding (not sure the exact name) but we had the fantastic chocolate torte, YUM YUM.  Maybe that's what they were calling small, it was a artful presentation and just the right amount to finish an already abundant food selection.Go, you'll be pleased as were we.  Can't wait for our next trip through Knoxville!"
emilia-knoxville,Amanda E.,"Knoxville, TN",12/6/2020,5.0,"Eating at Emilia's is always a treat! The service is always impeccable and the food is out of this world. Since my last visit, I have been eating more of a vegan diet and I was pleasantly surprised to find some delicious vegan options! The Campanelle con Funghi y Pinoli was to die for and my husband loved his squid ink and octopus pasta. Thanks again for a great night!"
emilia-knoxville,John M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/3/2021,2.0,"Food was tasty but service was unprofessional... my girlfriend ordered a cocktail, took half a sip to taste it, and the waitress gladly took the drink back to the back and brought her a glass of wine instead. However we still got charged $12 for an 8oz cocktail that we didn't even drink that was taken back? Not a good move to charge for something that was taken back. I was very disappointed in this."
emilia-knoxville,Betsy L.,"Blowing Rock, NC",5/3/2019,5.0,"My husband and I like to go to Emilia for date nights, but he's also taken clients there for business dinners, and we even went on our anniversary last year. The last time we went, we started with the PEI mussels, which came with bread, and we each got pasta. In the past, I've gotten the salmon and the half chicken, and both were delicious, especially the chicken! The restaurant itself is lovely and clean; it's a little bit rustic with exposed white brick walls, but pretty, delicate accents make it more feminine. It's also dimly lit, and the atmosphere as a whole is perfect for a date!"
emilia-knoxville,Christopher W.,"Maple Valley, WA",11/6/2019,5.0,"We had an incredible dining experience at Emilia. I visited with some mature colleagues during a work trip to Knoxville. Our server, Madison, was exceptional. She was highly attentive, knowledgeable about the food menu, studied in the nuances of the wine and cocktail menus, and gave fabulous recommendations. She had a friendly, sweet, and professional disposition that made us feel at ease, well taken care of, but also gave us the distance we wanted for our professional discourse. The food was delivered timely - and with a humorous exclamation for appetizers and bread - and it was delicious. Madison recommended the mushroom and truffle risotto and it did not disappoint. The Arborio was creamy and the mushrooms and truffles lended an amazing umami flavor profile to the dish. By the way, if you haven't caught on, Madison is an excellent server and Emilia should give her a raise and promote her immediately. In short, if you want a nice, upscale Italian dinner with great service, head to Emilia and make sure Madison waits on you. You will not be disappointed."
emilia-knoxville,Mitzi M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/26/2019,5.0,"We ate there before going to concert. It has always been consistently good.  I wish their chairs were more comfortable I would sit longer but maybe I would not leave. Great use of local foods. Balanced flavors savory,  spicey. This is our go to restaurant for market square area."
emilia-knoxville,C E.,"Anderson, SC",10/20/2019,5.0,Authentic Italian. Our waitress was informative and easy going. Had the carbonara and mushroom risotto and both were delicious. The tiramisu was unreal. Wine recommendations were on point and the brussel sprouts were melt in your mouth. Would definitely go back!
emilia-knoxville,Heather D.,"Oliver Springs, TN",10/12/2019,3.0,"The food was wonderful, but I was very disappointed when I came home and only half of my leftovers had been boxed up. I paid too much to only come home with a portion of what I purchased."
emilia-knoxville,Debbie A.,"Aurora, CO",10/3/2019,5.0,We seemed to wait for a bit for someone to recognize us but once the waitress came she did an excellent job. I'm not used to an Italian meal that doesn't include salade but everything was delicious. The chocolate Panna Cotta tasted like chocolate pudding but otherwise everything was great.
emilia-knoxville,Steve W.,"Knoxville, TN",10/2/2019,5.0,Best gluten free pizza I have ever had. And I have tried a lot of pizza over the last 10 years. The crust actually bubbles up like normal pizza crust. This is a must try!
emilia-knoxville,Mike K.,"Sunbury, OH",9/26/2019,3.0,"I was really disappointed... this place Yelps really good but my experience was not that. It could have had something to do with the waiter (Killian, like the beer) - I can't remember last time I got that little service in a restaurant but putting that aside. The food was good but not great. I really can't believe an Italian restaurant that does not serve any type of bread. I had a pasta dish with an egg and bacon which was rather small portion.  I liked the coke in the small bottle and the decor. The service was really bad and the food was not great. There are a bunch of other restaurants on the square that have better food and I think they all have better service. NOT WORTH THE TRIP."
emilia-knoxville,Nicole L.,"Decatur, GA",9/24/2019,5.0,"Woah.Exceeded my expectations for sure. The broccolini was so flavorful and cooked PERFECTLY. I'm a stickler on this one, and I'm not kidding.. nice crunch, amazing char, seasoning is beyond. Bolognese is insane.

emilia-knoxville,Kacy M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/20/2019,5.0,"Wow! WOW! Unbelievably good!The burrata was smooth and rich as butter. The risotta was creamy and delightfully flavorful. The carbonara was cheesy and smoky. The butterscotch pudding was salty, crunchy and the close your eyes kinda sweet and creamy. Best meal I've all year!"
emilia-knoxville,Brent G.,"Loudon, TN",9/18/2019,4.0,"Been to this place like 3 times and each time the food and service was great.   The half chicken is especially good.  The only negative is that the last two times we went there, there is a strange sewer odor that hits you the moment you walk in the front door.  Not very appetizing for a restaurant.  After being seated for a few minutes, you don't notice any odor but definitely is there when you first walk in."
emilia-knoxville,Rena H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",6/9/2017,3.0,"This is the 2nd time I've been here and both times have been good.  I like the atmosphere, service and location.  However, the price DOES NOT match the portion.  I ordered the following:Fusilli Carbonara ($15) - It had corkscrew pasta, bacon, romano cheese, poached egg.  It was good but not $15 good.  If they can give 1/4 more of a portion, I would say this place is excellent!!!Flor Di Latte Panna Cotta  - I don't remember the price but this was really good.  It had vanilla custard with orange and grapefruit served with Coconut Macaroons.  It was very light and not too sweet."
emilia-knoxville,Kathy C.,"Franklin, TN",3/23/2021,1.0,"Sorry this is so long, but I'm pretty mad. My family just had a birthday celebration at this restaurant tonight. We spent a lot of money on  market price steaks, apps and drinks so I  would have thought they'd want our business. I have never seen a restaurant mask shame you every time you stood up to walk. Walking in,  my daughter had her mask in hand and was about to put it on. The hostess immediately told her to put it on. She was in the process. A man walked over to her, bumped into her and told her she had to wear a mask. Literally our table was 10 yards from the entrance and now two people encountered my daughter WHO HAD A MASK!  My daughter went to the restroom. She had a mask in hand.  Again, they  stopped her and said put a mask on. There was literally one other table with people in the entire restaurant. If you walked to the restroom, you would be not be within 15 feet of others and  maybe 15 people total in the entire place including patrons and staff. Come on. Stop harassing people. Honestly, I think they didn't like that we prayed before dinner and harassed my daughter the entire  time about the masks if she stood up to walk anywhere. Everyone in our party had a mask and wore one. The waitress was nice and did her job. The food was good. The other men there were ready to harass and belittle  with even a mask in hand and about to be put on. They stood up behind the counter and it felt like they were trying to overhear our conversation. Just weird. I would go toother restaurants that welcome your business and aren't screaming a liberal agenda. I feel bad for the waitress. She did her job."
emilia-knoxville,Ken L.,"Strongsville, OH",11/21/2019,2.0,"Soooo......I really had high hopes for this place.  After a week of traveling through Alabama and most of Tennessee I thought this place would really round out the week.  Let me preface by saying I have been fortunate to eat at some of the best Italian places in NYC, Miami, Chicago, LA, Cleveland, Etc.  Bottom line, im a an Italian stuck in a Pollack's body.  I entered and was greeted by a wonderful couple of young ladies.  730 arrival on a Thursday and the place was about 35% capacity.  So plenty of tables.  Great ambiance.  Not too loud but can see where it could be on a busy Sat night.  I opted for the bar where I was greeted by Cory.  Cory admitted to being a rookie only 2 weeks in.  However,  I have to say this guy was great.  Cory did however make a ""rookie mistake""  I had about 1-1.5 oz of house Pinot in my glass and asked for another.  Cory topped off my wine with just about the same level as the first pour.  When your paying $12 for house level Pinot you would expect a better honest pour.  However, hes new I get it.  Ultimately, pretty disappointed overall.  Really just wanted outstanding classic italian.  I understand this is not Olive Garden but the menu was anything of classic italian.  Pics are posted of the menu.  Since they tout their ""handcrafted pasta""  I figured when in Rome.  But as most folks, did not want an entire Pasta dish.  I did see on the corner of the menu it clearly states, ""if you dont see it on the menu, ask and we will try to make it""  I asked Cory if Veal / Chicken Parm was a possibility as I see both prepared in some fashion on the menu.  Enter Manager....Who explained that veal is ground and I agreed this was not an option.  However, i still wanted their pasta.  I opted for the Chicken under the brick.  I asked for a side of pasta with that as well.  The manager explained that they do not do a side of pasta.  they offer kids meals for kids but pasta side was not an option.  What?  I said I was hoping to taste their ""hand crafted pasta""  I told him I was just looking for classic Italian.  The manager got a bit aggressive and said ""we have a very good classic Italian menu""  Without hesitation I told him noway.  Again in my confusion I asked if there was anyway to try the pasta.  Again I was told no.  I could buy another entree but a small side was not an option.  Disappointed, I ordered a side salad in addition to my chix.  The manager was quick to point out that salads are Alacarte.  OK....fine not a problem.  No garden salad!  Settled for the Grilled Caesar salad dressing on the side.  $7?  2 hearts of romaine slathered in oil and then grilled.  Have these guys not seen Gordon Ramsey kitchen nightmares where Gordon rips the chef for Grilled salad?  I mean WTH!  So I decided to roll with it and try it.  How bad could it be.  Yep......Not good.  See Gordons experience here. dailymotion.com/video/x6…I could not get this out of my head as i was eating this.  LOL!!!  I challenge all staff to watch this.  Halarrious!!!  Hey Chef!! Folks are laughing at you!  Now....with all that said, the Chicken under the brick was outstanding!!!  Heavy Garlic & butter sauce cooked perfectly with smashed fingerling potatoes!  Outstanding!!!  You know what would have made it even better?  Yup you guessed it!!!  Some of that ""handcrafted Pasta"" you talk about to everyone but will not sell.  Having worked in the Restaurant for many years there are several rules that everyone lives buy.  1.  If the customer asks for it find a way to make it happen.  Afterall your menu even draws attention to the fact you will do everything possible to make that happen.  2.  Upsell whenever possible!  Better for the House, better for the staff.  Individual Ticket sale value is what your judged on.  Higher tickets mean everyone makes more money.  3. everything is for sale within reason.  Surely youre not going to sell the tables and chairs.  However, you will let me buy a glass of wine, a bottle of a magnum.  Pretty sure I could buy an entire Cheesecake or a piece.  Again,  price it fairly and drive the ticket tally. Lastly, the customer.... yes the customer is the driver of what is served.  Not the chef!  Remember who is paying the bill.  Not the Chef!  The Customer.  Listen to your customers or they will go somewhere they will be listened to.  I was not asking you to compromise who you are or your Italian identity.  I was asking to try your food.  Afterall, you opened the restaurant to prepare and sell food.  Sell it!! It should be noted I was not looking for a free pasta.  On the contrary.  More than willing to pay for great food.  Sadly,  I will never know if the food you hold so closely and revere and will not allow folks to try.  Im pretty sure you will through product in the trash this evening that could have had an effect on overall revenue and sales.  Bottom line, the food service industry is waaaay to competitive to die on Pasta Hill.  Ill take my hard earned money elsewhere now."
emilia-knoxville,Dan H.,"Tucson, AZ",12/28/2018,5.0,Awesome food.  Really the best food we've found in Knoxville.  My wife had the potato gnocchi and I had the Chicken (cooked under brick). We shared for an incredible combination.  Absolutely delightful!For appetizers we had the warm olives and artichoke fritta.  Both were great. Desert was a unique frozen coconut and passion fruit mouse.  Just fantastic. We are only in town for 4 days but we will go back again before we leave.  Highly recommended.
emilia-knoxville,Lexi P.,"San Francisco, CA",3/13/2021,5.0,"Absolutely delicious! Upon my first visit, I was absolutely blown away by the atmosphere. Emilia marries the best of both worlds by combining less formal, business casual attire, with a romantic, industrial setting. The restaurant is very intimate and the food is excellent! This is definitely a new special occasion staple."
emilia-knoxville,Holly S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/24/2018,5.0,"Fantastic. We ordered the Muscles as an appetizer and OMG they come with grilled bread, which was life altering. We ordered the Bolognese Orecchiette and the Gnocchi for our mains and they were also delicious, although I will admit I liked the Gnocchi more than the other but we finished every morsel of both because they were both so good. For dessert we ordered the Panna Cotta and it was delicious and perfect paired with a glass of one of their after dinner wines. The service was fast and friendly; I really can't say enough good things about this place! I just wished we had pics to share but we ate everything too fast! We will most definitely be back! Yum!"
emilia-knoxville,Mengya L.,"Knoxville, TN",11/16/2018,5.0,"Had an awesome celebration dinner here. Weekday night parking is not a problem at all. There are free parking in the garage nearby. House wine and the bread with ricotta cheese warmed us up in this freezing weather. Our waitress is very enthusiastic and know every single dish so well! Because of her recommendation, I got the seasonal short rib ravioli dish, which made me can't stop wowing just because it's so good. Intentionally saved room for desserts since it's an Italian restaurant, and expected too much about the tiramisu. It looks cute in the cup but tastes just like rum. Hope the bottom of it could be more sweet and chocolate powder topping could be more bitter. That's the only bummer for our night. Gladly my friend ordered this chocolate dessert with caramel, and this one tastes awesome! Overall had a great night here!"
emilia-knoxville,Steph G.,"Woodbridge, VA",10/13/2018,4.0,"On our foodie adventure in Knoxville, we had to check out Emilia. Since we had visited a restaurant prior, we decided to have a pasta dish with an egg. This pasta was well made. What made it 10 times better was the egg, not to sweet, not to creamy, just right! Our server was kind and informing. I will say the place smelled kind of odd that day."
emilia-knoxville,Olga N.,"Knoxville, TN",10/25/2016,5.0,"Mamma mia! Che un pasto delizioso!Having previously eaten a few times at Knox Mason, I was amped for a good meal from Matt Gallaher's newest restaurant.  I didn't realize I'd be quite THIS pleased, though!Let me first begin by confessing I'm a serial Italian food basher.  I feel bad about it.  But I can't help myself.  I don't like bread.  I don't like pasta.  I don't like a plate of carbs.  I've been to Italy more than once, and even that wasn't enough to sway my Italian food hate.  But there's hope for redemption in Emilia.  I had an absolutely delicious meal here.  Not delicious Italian food, just delicious food that HAPPENED to be Italian.  Who knew it'd take a restaurant in lil' ole Market Square to change my mind?!ANTIPASTI:My better half and I shared the Artichoke Fritti.  DEAR LORD.  So good.  They were light and crispy and oh so yummy.  Just the tastiest lil' pillows of perfect you ever did eat.  I think we could have eaten at least a couple more plates of these.  They were served with a tangy caper aïoli.  Mmm.  Gettin' hungry just thinking about 'em.PASTI:I had the pasta special-- handmade agnolotti with roasted cauliflower, Parmesan cream and Brussels sprouts.  It was divine!  It was light and the portion was perfect.  I just loved, loved, loved everything about this dish.  I didn't realize before ordering that it was vegetarian, but woo!  I'm confident any self-described carnivore would have gladly eaten it.  The boyfriend had the Orecchiette with Ragu alla Bolognese (made with local Mitchell Farm beef and local Heritage Farm pork).  I was able to steal a couple bites before he finished his plate, and let me just say UNCTUOUS!  In the best of ways-- super rich and robust meat ragu against the delicate house-made pasta.  DOLCI:We split Chocolate Zeppole for dessert.  This was the only part of the meal I wasn't crazy about.  Not because they weren't good.  They were.  I'm just not usually big on sweets, and if I do splurge on a dessert, I prefer rich, decadent chocolate.  These were like beignets, almost a sweet version of the fritti we'd had as an appetizer except with ricotta and dark chocolate.  The blood orange curd that accompanied it was quite tart, which works well with dark chocolate.  It just isn't my jam.  Guess I'll have to try the Nutella Panna Cotta next time.  Darn.  Poor me.  Looking forward to coming back and trying many, many more dishes!Ciao!"
emilia-knoxville,Brad H.,"Anderson, SC",7/13/2017,4.0,"Excellent Italian that I would characterize as elevated Italian. We ate with friends and had a great time. Tables were small, but our waiter, Killian, managed to keep the meal orderly.  My wife had a fennel salad with shaved Parmesan that was outstanding.  Her main course was a concoction of mushroom and ricotta pasta. Apparently she liked it enough to forget to share.  I had the salmon with risotto... a cucumber salad on top made things interesting. A delightful meal. Well prepared salmon was pan roasted to perfection. We followed up with a great tiramisu in a cup. Our waiter was knowledgeable, pleasant, and attentive. The atmosphere was relaxed and quieter than I expected. We were able to carry on conversation very easily. Great place.  I would come back."
emilia-knoxville,Paul S.,"Milwaukee, WI",10/31/2018,4.0,"Excellent meal service was good. Had the beets to start which were served with balsamic vinegar and pistachio butter, which was very refreshing after a long day. For my main meal, I had the hand made orecchiette pasta with bolognese that was a meat forward flavorful dish. I chose charred broccolini with preserved lemon garlic and chili as my side. Ended the night with the dark chocolate torta which was a nice portion size (I hate giant desserts) and a great finish. My server was relatively attentive but not very warm for a first time visitor to the city and restaurant. All in all, a place I would happily return to when in Knoxville"
emilia-knoxville,Christine H.,"Caliente, NV",11/1/2020,1.0,"I can't speak to the quality of the food, drinks, or service because we never got a chance to eat here.  What I can speak to is the fact that they yanked the rug out from under our wedding reception dinner hours before our wedding.  We had made a reservation weeks in advance specifically for the patio because we have several family members who are immune compromised.  I was very clear when I made the reservation that it needed to be outdoors.  Hours before our dinner a family member went there to drop off a cake and noticed that they didn't have tables on their patio.  They had moved our reservation inside and didn't even bother to call us and let us know!  I found out minutes after our ceremony ended and we had to scramble to figure out where to go to celebrate safely with our family.  Luckily, Oliver Royale (highly recommend!!) got us in on their patio.  Emilia's management was very unsympathetic about the whole thing.  They blamed it on us, saying that we were told that if there was a chance of rain they would move the tables inside, but I had them on speakerphone when I made the reservation and neither I nor my husband remember anyone saying that.   I'm sure their food is delightful, but I'll never go here!"
emilia-knoxville,Daisey S.,"Powell, TN",12/4/2019,2.0,"Overpriced and overrated. Focaccia and carbonara were too salty. The bolognese looked and tasted like a microwaveable meal but with exceptional noodles. Like the sauce from a Michelina dinner poured over a bowl of al dente noodles. But too many noodles. It was like when you pour a big bowl of cereal and then realize you only have a splash of milk, but you're hungry and you don't want to put the cereal back in the box so you just go with it. So imagine that, but with pasta. Also the seating reminded me of a cruise ship where you don't really want to make eye contact with the people next to you, but it's impossible not to and you feel the need to have small talk. When you get a soda they bring out the little glass bottle like you're in Italy, but then you remember you're in Knoxville and you just want unlimited refills. Especially because your pasta was as dry as the Sahara desert."
emilia-knoxville,Kleopatra G.,"Nashville, TN",10/15/2018,5.0,"The experience at Emilia was perfection from start to finish. We came on Friday night around 7pm and there was no wait. I appreciate the asthetic of the restaurant, clean and  trendy but in a classic way. I must say that the service was impeccable. The server showed us just the right amount of attention. I also appreciated the manager, I'm assuming it was the manger, who came over to ensure we enjoyed the meal and had everything we needed They have customer service down packed. I didn't spot a bad attitude in sight. As for food, I ordered the fisherman's stew. It was packed with flavor and a decent portion. I do wish it came with an extra piece of bread to soak up the wonderful red sauce in the stew. We also ordered the broccolini and the char on it was so so good but yet it was still a fresh vegetable dish.  It's a bit pricey but between the service and the food itself, it's well worth it."
emilia-knoxville,Dee O.,"Knoxville, TN",11/12/2016,5.0,"I have eaten here quite a few times now and the bottom line is that you should eat here. The food is consistently delicious and service is on point. However I recommend making reservations ahead of time if possible. Apparently word is out on the streets that Emilia is fantastic. I honestly have loved everything I have tried. The portions are small so get multiple dishes. If you are feeling particularly hungry, the chicken dish is not only a huge serving, it is also very tasty. The items I keep going back to on the menu include the broccolini (so delicious!), the salmon, the artichoke fritti and oh my gosh, the potato gnocchi. That gnocchi melts in your mouth like butter. Definitely get that. I have tried a couple of different menu times too and everything is honestly really good. Word on the street is that the pasta is homemade. Combine that with a local talented chef who values local and seasonal produce and you have yourself a winner. In case you haven't already guessed, I am a big fan. Definitely a must visit when you are in Knoxville!"
emilia-knoxville,Laura B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/8/2018,4.0,"Overall, a fantastic experience and possibly my new favorite dinner spot on market square.Service was excellent from beginning to end. Although the restaurant was full, we didn't feel rushed, crowded or overwhelmed. I really enjoyed the atmosphere which was nice without being pretentious. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and a black Manhattan that my husband wouldn't stop raving about. We were fortunate enough to arrive on a night that arancini were being served, which I haven't seen in any other restaurants in TN. They were excellent. I ordered the fusilli carbonara, my husband ordered the scallop agnolotti. We were both thrilled with our choices, it's a real pleasure to dine somewhere that offers house made pasta. Both dishes were generous enough to be filling and perfectly seasoned. It seemed many of the dishes on the menu were a step or two away from being truly authentic Italian, but it's a very nice refresher in a town that otherwise boasts only a handful of red sauce restaurants, most of which are mediocre at that. We also ordered the focaccia, which was a disappointment. It was overdone, and I suspect that this was not just ours but every loaf we saw go past. It also had a gummy texture, perhaps the overbaking was trying to compensate for other proofing/texture issues. It was also more of a sourdough rather than what I would expect as a focaccia. If you're a fan of well done bread, go for it, but I wouldn't order it again. The desserts didn't look too tempting, either on the menu or walking past, so we opted to skip those as well. With a bit more solid dessert offering and bread situation I think this place would be 5 stars."
emilia-knoxville,Ryan K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",2/19/2018,1.0,"Reservations apparently don't mean anything here at Emilia... I was planning on taking my fiance out on an anniversary dinner in downtown Knoxville, and made a reservation on OpenTable. We were looking forward to the night, and received a confirmation from the restaurant of our time.... To my surprise, I get an e-mail late the night before our date saying that the reservation was cancelled... WOW. So unprofessional. No explanation or even a phone call as to what happened. Whoever is working here really has a lot to learn. My advice -- don't waste your time with this place. Go somewhere else that will actually honor their reservations."
emilia-knoxville,Martin D.,"Memphis, TN",11/7/2019,5.0,"Emilia is a wonderful popular Italian restaurant on Market Square in Knoxville. They have a good choice of appetizers, entrees, desserts and adult beverages. To me the bonus is that you can have a conversation without yelling because the noise level is low."
emilia-knoxville,Anna J.,"San Francisco, CA",3/9/2020,5.0,"This might be my favorite Knoxville restaurant. The pasta is always fresh and delicious, and the menu changes frequently with interesting additions. The warm olives and mussels are a must to start. I've never actually ordered anything but pasta for my main dish, so I can't speak to the meat and fish, but the pasta is excellent. The cocktails are good to start, but they have a decent wine list as well. Dessert is hit or miss- I'd recommend sticking with a port if you're on the fence."
emilia-knoxville,Rico V.,"Louisville, KY",10/31/2018,5.0,"i dined in last month when i was visiting knoxville after checking out to see what other restaurants were in market square. this one caught my eye and i'm oh so glad it did. it was a friday night, and it was literally all laughs and smiles in the restaurant. our drinks were superb, service was A1, the gm kept checking on us which was great + i absolutely loved the food. the couple next to us even asked to take a photo of us so that was a lovely add on."
emilia-knoxville,Frances H.,"Austin, TX",11/13/2017,5.0,"Squid ink bucatini cut up into teeny pieces accompanied with crab meat was just what I needed and didn't even know it! After a long travel day to Knoxville, Italian food was the perfect idea to comfort my tired soul. Expecting to go with your typical Italian comfort dish, like bolognese and spaghetti with meatballs, I couldn't resist ordering the bucatini special.Before the entree, we went with their Warm Castelvetrano Olives: with Calabrian Chile, Garlic and Thyme and Warm Housemade Foccacia:with Cruze Farm Ricotta, Georgia Olive Oil, Flaky Sea Salt and Fresh Cracked Pepper. Those appetizers might have been my favorite part of the meal; however each bite of the bucatini was better than the one before. I am not sure if it was the perfect al dente texture of the small pieces of squid-ink-covered noodles or the non-overwhelming taste of deliciously rich crab - it was just dang good. The saddest part was my inability to finish the whole dish and that I couldn't take it home for leftovers. The ambiance and service was warm and welcoming, much like you'd get at any Italian dinner with family and friends. I walked away very happy that I got to experience Emilia while in Knoxville."
emilia-knoxville,Brad E.,"Columbia, SC",1/12/2019,5.0,"Could not be happier for modern Italian in downtown Knox!  Atmosphere was quiet enough for intimate conversation even though the place was packed on a rainy Saturday! Grilled romaine Caesar was perfectly bitter and creamy, warm olives were a nice treat, house made focaccia was paired with a mix of butter and oil.  Ribeye was bursting with flavor and perfectly med-rare with a disc of thyme butter on top and served with the resting juices to accent the polenta and mushrooms.  Wife's carbonara was amazing with chunks of Benton's bacon and an expertly poached egg to complement its béchamel.  MUST TRY is the Butterscotch Budino, the pine nut crumble alone was worth the trip.  Make a reservation!"
emilia-knoxville,Kristi B.,"Hendersonville, NC",5/20/2018,4.0,"Best dinner in Market Square! We usually sit at the bar, and Scott is our bartender. He is super knowledgeable with wines and can also make a mean Ginger Lemon Drop off the cuff. Our favorite downtown Knoxville dinner, hands down!  This is not your local neighborhood Olive Garden."
emilia-knoxville,Jillian E.,"North Brookfield, MA",11/30/2017,5.0,"We absolutely love this restaurant. We have come two years in a row from New England to have dinner in memory of my daughter, Emilia. The staff has always gone above and beyond to honor Emilia with us, making us feel like part of the family. Killian was our server this year and he was wonderful- very polite and attentive. The meal was delicious and the desserts were divine! We can't wait to return next year. If you are local, definitely check this place out. You won't be disappointed. And try the butterscotch dessert- it's seriously the best thing I've ever had!"
emilia-knoxville,Greg M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/14/2016,5.0,This is a fantastic restaurant. The tables were all reserved but we sat at the bar and that worked fine. I had the pork with fennel wrapped in prosciutto. Lots of flavor. Tender juicy meat. Our appetizer was artichoke fritters. Five balls. Really good. But salty and came with a good dipping sauce. Dinner for two with appetizer and drinks was $58. Not bad for a very high quality experience. The atmosphere is excellent. Casual chic like an Italian farmhouse. We were served by the bartender. She was new but had a good attitude.
emilia-knoxville,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",11/12/2017,5.0,Some of the reviews have mentioned small portions. I thought they were portioned well but it depends on what you order because some portions are smaller than others. Just get a salad or an app and you'll be fine. The service was really really good. Our glasses were never empty and as soon as they got a little low someone came around to refill them. They also have a nice wine list and the waitress seemed knowledgeable. The atmosphere was also really nice and it wasn't overly loud. The butterscotch dessert was surprisingly good and I'm looking forward to eating there again so I can try something new.
emilia-knoxville,V C.,"Wheaton, IL",5/14/2019,5.0,Wow.  Was not expecting the service of Italy in Knoxville.  I may seek travel opportunities to return to East TN.  Excellent service.  Thank you Lauren. Consistent focus on exceeding expectations.  Thank you chef for custom item exception of italien parm cheese for dessert.  Created the perfect evening and memories of Tuscany for me.  Will return.  Cheers.
emilia-knoxville,Debbie A.,"Aurora, CO",10/3/2019,5.0,We seemed to wait for a bit for someone to recognize us but once the waitress came she did an excellent job. I'm not used to an Italian meal that doesn't include salade but everything was delicious. The chocolate Panna Cotta tasted like chocolate pudding but otherwise everything was great.
emilia-knoxville,Jim S.,"Safety Harbor, FL",7/15/2017,5.0,"Called ahead for a 6 PM reservation at 5:25 PM on a Friday.  Right?The hostess was very gracious and asked her manager if they could accommodate us, they did.  Walked in at 6 PM and the restaurant rather empty making me wonder what the fuss was about, by 7 PM it was packed.With the atmosphere, the service, the food, the wine list, nothing was disappointing.   Nothing!!!Truly outstanding in all areas.Although YELP rates the prices $$, I would consider it a high-end affair with marginal portions but exactly suited to what high-end food should be.There is nothing to change, it hits the TARGET in every area. Bravo and good work!"
emilia-knoxville,Natalie T.,"Old City, Knoxville, TN",10/10/2020,5.0,Great food and atmosphere. Highly recommend. This is one of my staples downtown. The staff has always been very accommodating as well.
emilia-knoxville,Denise T.,"Detroit, MI",8/23/2019,4.0,Located in cute area of downtown. Nice atmosphere with decent wine selection. Staff were attentive with suggestions for wine pairings. Pasta is homemade and sauces are good. Focaccia appetizer was excellent.
emilia-knoxville,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",6/11/2017,2.0,"I wanted to love this place since it's so cute, but not a thing we ordered was tasty. Part of this may be my own problem as I'm not a pasta lover, but my husband is ok with it and even his pasta dish was unpalatable. We had the focaccia w/ricotta, arugula salad, meatballs with polenta, and a pesto pasta special with Benton's breakfast sausage. For me the bread was ok but I strongly disliked the combo of the ricotta with the pungent, extra nutty? (extra something!) olive oil poured over the top, so that kinda ruined it for me. My husband didn't like the bread itself either. The arugula salad had a lot of stuff I love in it so I was excited to try it, but it was underwhelming and bland. As for the meatballs and polenta (my order because no pasta), my husband said it best when he noted it tasted like ""cafeteria food."" The special was probably the worst of all, though. The flavors just did not jive! I have no idea why because it sounded like it would be delicious. I've never been a big Italian fan, but after eating so many delectable dishes in boston's north end last year, my eyes were opened and I've been craving more of it. I was hoping Emilia was going to be the answer to Knoxville's Italian problems, but it seems I have to keep looking. That being said I'm obviously not a very good judge of Italian food since I don't have much experience with it, so take this with a grain of salt / tell me how to order better!"
emilia-knoxville,Bella H.,"Portsmouth, RI",8/3/2019,5.0,Our waiter was so nice and personable. Our meals were served promptly. Some of the best Italian food I've ever had. A great place to people watch and had great dessert. Very good atmosphere
emilia-knoxville,Kathleen B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/9/2019,5.0,"I'm from Chicago, and Emilia's is the closet thing to authentic Italian around Knoxville. Very good."
emilia-knoxville,Alison S.,"Falls Church, VA",12/31/2017,4.0,Awesome meal! A little pricey for the portions but the quality was top notch. Dessert was somewhat underwhelming though. Beautiful rustic decor. Love the ambiance.
emilia-knoxville,Kristy B.,"Charleston, SC",8/18/2018,5.0,"I had the corn agnolotti and it was divine!!! Smaller portions, but worth every penny. Fresh pasta, amazing taste of corn, and a tiny bit of heat made it heavenly! I actually used a spoon to drink the last of the sauce! Oh, and the bruschetta was delicious as well!! Fresh tomatoes of multiple varieties, burrata, and wonderful toast! I wish there had been more toast!!! My husband had the Bolognese which he loved. I liked it even though I don't love pork! Great ambience. Nothing at all to complain about. Will try dessert and coffee next time!"
emilia-knoxville,erin d.,"Chicago, IL",12/14/2018,2.0,"Pretentious. Overpriced. Poor Management. Food was decent (I personally loved the marrow-butter-smothered ribeye), but the pasta dishes were chewy. There was an issue with a drink order at our table and you would think it was the end of days. We were treated like second class citizens and I will never go back."
emilia-knoxville,Connie B.,"Corryton, TN",3/12/2017,2.0,"I know I am in the minority with the rating but here are the reasons. 1 Could not make reservations, had to set at bar even though tables sat empty the whole time. We arrived before opening so we were the first ones there and no reason to make us go to the bar for a party of two.2 Bartenders were awesome, friendly and helpful 3 The warm Housemade focaccia was pretty good but very hard but if you want bread you have to pay for it. 4 The potato Gnocchi was awesome and would recommend5 The Bucahti Carbonoara and Ricotta  cavatelli with Rahu Alla Bolognese was not good at all. Would never recommend and they were our primiary meals. Very small portions 6 Desserts were very good and would only go back for them. tiramisu and butterscotch Budino."
emilia-knoxville,marcy s.,"Chicago, IL",9/5/2020,5.0,Our 2nd time traveling thru Knoxville and eating at Emilia. From Chicago we eat well. This was amazing to say the least. The appetizer of fried eggplant with marscapone  & honey was amazing. Grilled romaine that was outstanding. We split the  meatballs & polenta was  scrumptious. 5 star all the way.  Chrissy our server  & bartender rocked it.
emilia-knoxville,T.D. M.,"Hazlehurst, MS",7/16/2019,5.0,Emilia has replaced Naples as the best Italian restaurant in Knoxville. Sunday night I had the grilled Romaine salad which is really outstanding. I followed this with the Carbonara which was better than what we make at home Dessert was the chocolate flan which was the perfect ending. Be sure to try this gem in East TN
emilia-knoxville,Kim H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/19/2018,3.0,"My husband and I went for the first time the other night for our anniversary. We made a reservation through Open Table and it asked if there was a special occasion so I checked yes. (We weren't offered anything special, which doesn't affect my review). We have been wanting to try this place since it opened but haven't gotten around to it. We did come awhile back and they asked if we had a reservation, which we did not, so I would highly recommend making a reservation to eat here. I have heard so much about this place and so I had high expectations. They are located in a terrific spot on Market Sq. and I'm glad to see that the space has been turned over to a restaurant. Due to my high expectations I was a bit disappointed with the food. I'm happy that we ordered the mussels as an appetizer because our entrees left us still walking out hungry. The bread that comes with the mussels was the best part of the meal, and the sauce the mussels came in was perfect for dipping. We both tried items off the pasta menu (squash agnolotti and shortrib francobolli). Yes, the entrees are small, which I'm okay with as long as they are filling but both of our entrees came with meat (the squash came with Benton's country ham and the shortrib obviously came with shortrib) and I was very disappointed in the amount of meat that was in both entrees. I understand that anything Benton's is expensive, but there were small shaved pieces of country ham that I could barely taste. My husband's shortrib (with shortrib in the entree title) was lacking as well. Both were tasty, but the amount of ingredients just turned me off. Our bill of $80 for mussels, 2 pastas, and 2 glasses of wine didn't seem worth it. I declined dessert only because I had a feeling it was going to be small for what it was too. I wasn't expecting an ""Olive Garden portion"" for this type of restaurant but I've been to similar restaurants with the same menu style and Emilia just didn't live up to my expectations. I won't be in a hurry to come back, and if I do, I might come back with the expectation of enjoying a few app's and a glass of wine on the patio of a nice day vs. for dinner."
emilia-knoxville,D T.,"Covington, KY",10/18/2018,4.0,Excellent food but portions for the specialty drinks and pastas could have been greater.Very nice service as well.

emilia-knoxville,Scott W.,"Powell, TN",10/13/2018,3.0,"Food, including appetizers was great.  Small portion if main dish.  However service slow and required requesting an item twice only to receive it at the end of the meal.  Very disappointed with the service but taste  presentation of main course and atmosphere are acceptable.  One final point avoid the bar stools, too small!"
emilia-knoxville,Steph G.,"Woodbridge, VA",10/13/2018,4.0,"On our foodie adventure in Knoxville, we had to check out Emilia. Since we had visited a restaurant prior, we decided to have a pasta dish with an egg. This pasta was well made. What made it 10 times better was the egg, not to sweet, not to creamy, just right! Our server was kind and informing. I will say the place smelled kind of odd that day."
emilia-knoxville,Judy W.,"VA, VA",9/28/2018,5.0,"AMAZING!!!! One of the best meals we've ever had in a restaurant, anywhere! Our server, Elise, was delightful, and so knowledgeable.  The octopus was delicious and so was the burrata. Loved the Brussels sprouts and all of the pastas!  The gnocchi was the best I've ever eaten and the summer squash/ricotta agnolotti was fabulous! My husband got the meatballs, they were also amazing. Butterscotch pudding for dessert surpassed our expectations. The service was second to none and the staff so friendly. Thank you Elise and Emilia staff!!  We will be back!!!"
emilia-knoxville,Susan R.,"Boston, MA",9/20/2018,5.0,"This was the a great choice. I am from out of town and this was awesome.  Every course was so delicious.  Highly recommend the olives, grilled romaine salad, and any  pasta dish."

Yes, with the language speaking family members and all.This place is decent, but seems to shoot itself in the foot by changing the menu frequently.That chicken dish? It was freaking great.If it ain't broke, don't fix it.Your cocktails need some tinkering.Your waitstaff is excellent.Great place. Stop changing your menu."
emilia-knoxville,Sarah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",6/27/2016,5.0,"I took my boyfriend here about two weeks ago for my turn to plan a date night. It was $85 for 3 small plates, two entrees, dessert, and tip. Great price when you consider how completely amazing the food was. We ordered the olives, asparagus, and Caprese salad to start, the Lump Crab Risotto, and the Campanelle for our entrees (both pastas made in-house), then the Affogato Inverso (coffee ice cream with sugar cone pieces) for dessert. The entire meal took an hour and a half because we were savoring every bite. It was delicious.The atmosphere was my second favorite part. Sleek and understated so that the focus of the experience was on each other instead of everything going on around us. Also, it was a full house with a large group next to us, and it still remained quiet throughout the entire meal. Our server, Stephanie (I think?), was great. She had every table filled and never missed a beat or seemed fazed.We didn't get drinks this time, but the drink menu looked lovely and we'll definitely be back to explore."
emilia-knoxville,Salmaan T.,"Washington, DC",8/20/2016,4.0,"Excellent service, unique food, and great ambience. This was our first time visiting Emilia and it's found an untapped niche in the downtown area. Italian food that isn't what you usually think of Italian. food. We ordered the grilled caesar salad and focaccia with ricotta appetizers. Both were excellent. For our main courses we had the seafood stew and gnocchi with their basil pesto. Both were very good. Personally I feel the stew would have been excellent with a little kick but that's just me. Still both were very tasty dishes. For dessert we had the butterscotch flavor explosion thingy. Butterscotch with salted caramel and roasted pine nuts. Really great. Will definitely be back. Great addition to market square."
emilia-knoxville,Jeana H.,"Providence, RI",8/12/2018,5.0,"Emilia is one of my favorite spots in Knoxville. The space is beautiful, the decor is simple and kind of vintage. The atmosphere is relaxed with great music. I like to order a variety of dishes and share them family style. Every dish is so delicious. I am partial to the carbonara and the focaccia. And the grilled romaine. And he mussels."
emilia-knoxville,Spencer D.,"Knoxville, TN",12/5/2016,4.0,"Definitely the most trendy, innovative Italian restaurant in downtown Knoxville. They offer classic entrees with modern, yet tasty appetizers. We started off with the grilled Cesar salad which was rather small for two people, but had incredible flavor. I am a carbonaraholic so, of course, I order the carbonara dish. The pasta was corkscrew and perfectly al dente, but being critical of the classical Roman dish, I hoped it contained a long noodle. The flavor of the bacon and egg mixture was well blended. Excellent place for a date night. Noise level was dull roar to average, and the atmosphere is modern rustic with decor. Definitely recommended to try. Pros- Stylish decor and exceptional flavor.Cons- If you expecting the classic Italian experience, such as large portions and free bread out the wahzoo, you will be disappointed."
emilia-knoxville,Audrey C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/18/2016,5.0,"Emilia is fantastic, delicious and pricey. The food everyone had was excellent but of course the carbonara was the table favorite. I tasted the carbonara and still elected to get my own order of mussels. I love mussels and these were perfect. I could've picked up the bowl and drank the white wine sauce. Fortunately my mother was paying for the meal (which frankly I couldn't have afforded) so I left the wine sauce in the bowl. Our server was delightful and we had an excellent time. I am anxious to see how this restaurant fairs once the excitement wears off from the grand opening. Entrees ranging from $14 to $34 are not common in Knoxville."
emilia-knoxville,Joe L.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",8/10/2016,5.0,Yelp was right on the money per usual. Stopped in for dinner while on a business trip. Nice looking restaurant inside and friendly staff. I sat at the bar and Scott was a great waiter. Very friendly and informative about their menu. Easy to talk to also. He recommended the gnocchi which I was considering anyway so I went ahead and ordered it.  Literally less than 5 mins went by and it arrived. The gnocchi itself had a great soft texture. Just little pillows goodness. The sauce was my favorite part - great flavor and left a great taste in your mouth after the meal. I also loved their portion size. Not a giant heap of stomach bloating pasta but just right so you were satisfied and didn't feel the need for more (even though it was so good I considered ordering another plate of it for a minute). Overall I loved the experience and food and can't wait to come back.
emilia-knoxville,Wayne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",5/4/2016,5.0,"The much anticipated opening of Emilia was last night . . . the second restaurant by chef Matt Gallaher, of Knox Mason acclaim. He's certainly among the very top chefs in Ktown, having done time in the sensational Blackberry Farm kitchen as well at Gov. & Mrs. William Haslam's residence of late. Agnolotti Primavera: Cruze Farm ricotta stuffed pasta with foraged ramps, fresh artichokes, fresh asparagus, pine nuts and Parmesan hit such a celestial high note with it's tender pasta . . . luscious ricotta . . . and the rest . . . well I don't honestly know if I've tasted a better dish anywhere in the past several years. Other high notes: grilled romaine with Parm, olive oil-cured herbed bread crumbs with Caesar dressing; steamed PEI muscles with fennel, garlic, white wine and grilled housemade bread (I'm given to dipping lots of bread in the broth after all the mussels are gone . . . then pouring to remaining broth in a glass and drinking it . . . try it); housemade focaccia with more Cruze Farm ricotta, Georgia olive oil, flaky salt and cracked pepper. Only low note: artichoke fritti with delish lemon and caper aioli. Too bad I can't afford to eat there every night for a couple weeks . . . .Well, the machine that makes the ethereal pasta costs some $8,000+. The chef, Matt Gallaher, who pulls the strings on what goes into and on top of and all around the pasta is an $8 million master. On my most recent visit I tried the Cruze Farm ricotta based ""little hollow"" cavatelli tossed in Bolognese sauce made with Mitchel Farm beef, Stauss veal, and Heritage Farm pork, sprinkled with pecorino romano. Simply amazing! Taking home 1/3 of the dish for lunch the next day only cemented my original impression . . ."
emilia-knoxville,John Q.,"Knoxville, TN",7/22/2018,5.0,"One of our top 5 favorites in Knoxville. The food is delicious without being pretentious like some other trendy places in town, the ambiance is pleasant and subdued and the staff don't try to use big words to describe the food, further distinguishing themselves from other hipster concept joints. Not trying to be too negative about the other places...we dine there as well. I mean, sometimes you just gotta have pickled watermelon rind. Just complimenting Emilia on a job well done without trying too hard. We'll be back!"
emilia-knoxville,Sam R.,"Greater Heights, Houston, TX",3/6/2019,4.0,"Great lemon panna cotta... ive been there a few times, very friendly staff, humble owner and management team touch their tables, food is pretty good, I must say i have had a not so good experience once with the octopus appetizer being a little over cooked but I'm a bit picky on my octopus so maybe its just me..."
emilia-knoxville,Summer S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/3/2018,2.0,"The place looked great and the service was very friendly. However, the music was too loud and we had to change seats  to avoid being blasted with the music. The food was okay but not excellent. The price was way too high for the amount and the quality of the food. We had the Artichoke Fritti($8), the Gnocchi Amatriciana($17), and the Genovese Style Fisherman's Stew ($26). The Fritti was pretty good. The Gnocchi was presented in a simple tomato sauce with barely anything else in it. The menu said ""Hand Rolled Potato Dumplings with Traditional Amatriciana Sauce of House Cured Pork Jowl, Garlic, Chiles, San Marzano Tomatoes and Pecorino Romano"". The thinness and the amount of the ""house cured pork jowl"" was comparable to some of the truffle dishes I'd had before, sans the taste. It was so thin I could barely taste anything. The fish stew was okay, but neither the fish nor the mussels had any taste at all, very, very bland. I wondered wether the kitchen prepared a big pot of stew, then boiled the fish and the mussels to put in the plate. Both the fish and the mussels were also too fishy for me, hubby liked it, said that the fish was sufficiently tender. On the plus side, the portion was sufficiently small, and there was no bread basket before the meal. Good for health conscious people. (Bad for frugal minded people who are used to share a dish.) The bill was $60 before tips. For that amount of money, we'd expect something better."
emilia-knoxville,Kurt W.,"Oak Ridge, TN",2/15/2019,5.0,Excellent all he way around. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing. The octopus was tender and flavorful and the pasta was outstanding! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
emilia-knoxville,Joce L.,"TN, TN",2/12/2019,5.0,"Amazing service and food. Must get the Brussels sprouts and ciabatta for an appetizer! Portions are perfect. You won't find any other specialty Italian in Knoxville. Reservations help, but we've never had to wait long even when they're busy. Can't wait to bring our next visitors!"
emilia-knoxville,Amy S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/13/2016,5.0,"I was able to sneak in without a reservation because I was dining solo :) grabbed a seat at the bar--the bartenders were both really nice, as were all the wait staff.Attention to detail was excellent- I saw waitresses checking wine glasses for water spots before taking them to a table, my dishes were beautifully plated...a class act.  Pacing was a bit slow for someone who forgot her book in the car, but if I'd have had a dining companion I wouldn't have noticed.I got the seasonal caprese salad (no mushy tomatoes here, instead it had sweet peas, and asparagus), which was small if you compare it to a chain restaurant.  It was fine for me, definitely a starter and not an entree salad.  The flavors and textures were very nicely balanced and they give you a generous portion of mozzarella.As far as pasta, I don't know what people are complaining about with the portion--I could barely finish mine.  I got the cavatelli with bolognese, which had just enough sauce.  I think people were expecting an Olive Garden-style pound of ground beef sauce plopped on top of pasta...which isn't how they serve it in Italy.  Emilia does their pasta right, tossed with just enough sauce to coat so you don't lose the pasta in it (I also got plenty of meat).  Coming from an Italian family, I am very familiar with cavatelli, and they knocked it out of the park.  The pasta was al dente but tender.I got a side of the olive oil braised kale; I didn't read closely enough and was surprised at the amount of oil there, so I didn't end up finishing it (too rich, and it was a sizeable pile).  The kale itself, though, was wonderful.  I couldn't make out the garlic or rosemary distinctly, but all the bitterness was gone from the kale without overcooking it, so I was happy.The tiramisu was everything I could ever want in a tiramisu--thick, creamy custard, soft ladyfingers, plenty of espresso...so good.I didn't have room for coffee, but I'd like to try the espresso next time.  Very pleased and impressed with my meal--so glad Knoxville has a good Italian option!"
emilia-knoxville,Janine A.,"Knoxville, TN",7/21/2018,5.0,Hands down best italian in the city. It's pricey ($$$) but worth it for a true farm-to-table experience. Highly recommend making reservations days in advance as they are often booked!
emilia-knoxville,Jennifer A.,"Holden Beach, NC",7/14/2018,4.0,"Good food, good service.  The chicken dish I had was unusual and cooked perfectly.  The dessert was outstanding - would go back for either the meal or dessert.  Seemed like food took a little long to arrive but other than that, no complaints."
emilia-knoxville,Taylor S.,"Greeneville, TN",7/7/2018,5.0,The brick chicken is so good and it's just a fun place to eat in market square. Try a dessert too!
emilia-knoxville,Joel P.,"Baton Rouge, LA",7/17/2018,5.0,"Great Italian place that we've dined at before.  great cocktails, food and ambience.  Nothing beats great food and Joy Division in the background"
emilia-knoxville,Renee A.,"Murfreesboro, TN",10/30/2018,1.0,"I love writing great reviews and detest writing bad ones...and reserve the bad for the truly deserving. Emilia was such a huge let down. The reviews had my hopes up and of course are what an out of towner has to go on. We had previously eaten at the Oliver Royale and were blown away with how wonderful everything was....and it was for a rehearsal dinner with 24 guest. The Royale made everybody feel very welcome and the food was AMAZING! Emilia was reserved for a party of TWO and was a flop! First off, it was a birthday dinner which was disclosed on the reservation TWICE but was NEVER mentioned. Secondly and even more important...the entrees were pathetic! Mine truly tasted like HAMBURGER HELPER!! The grilled salad was interesting since I had never had anything like it and the chocolate desert was very good but the main event was AWFUL! Our server was good but even good service can not overcome pitiful entrees and a loud speaker blaring overhead in what should be a nice and intimate environment.Sorry for Emilia....just go to the Oliver!!! It is fantastic!!"
emilia-knoxville,Mitzi M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/26/2019,5.0,"We ate there before going to concert. It has always been consistently good.  I wish their chairs were more comfortable I would sit longer but maybe I would not leave. Great use of local foods. Balanced flavors savory,  spicey. This is our go to restaurant for market square area."
emilia-knoxville,Joseph W.,"Knoxville, TN",6/8/2016,5.0,Best Orecchiete I've ever had.Best focaccia I've ever had.Add the Blackberry Farms saison and thank me later.
emilia-knoxville,R J.,"Houston, TX",6/30/2018,5.0,"The bread was really good, and so was the octopus. The pastas were both delicious, we had the carbonara and the bolognese. The butterscotch dessert was my favorite. I would get it all again without the octopus, just because that was a once in a while kind of thing."
emilia-knoxville,C E.,"Anderson, SC",10/20/2019,5.0,Authentic Italian. Our waitress was informative and easy going. Had the carbonara and mushroom risotto and both were delicious. The tiramisu was unreal. Wine recommendations were on point and the brussel sprouts were melt in your mouth. Would definitely go back!
emilia-knoxville,Kim H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/19/2018,3.0,"My husband and I went for the first time the other night for our anniversary. We made a reservation through Open Table and it asked if there was a special occasion so I checked yes. (We weren't offered anything special, which doesn't affect my review). We have been wanting to try this place since it opened but haven't gotten around to it. We did come awhile back and they asked if we had a reservation, which we did not, so I would highly recommend making a reservation to eat here. I have heard so much about this place and so I had high expectations. They are located in a terrific spot on Market Sq. and I'm glad to see that the space has been turned over to a restaurant. Due to my high expectations I was a bit disappointed with the food. I'm happy that we ordered the mussels as an appetizer because our entrees left us still walking out hungry. The bread that comes with the mussels was the best part of the meal, and the sauce the mussels came in was perfect for dipping. We both tried items off the pasta menu (squash agnolotti and shortrib francobolli). Yes, the entrees are small, which I'm okay with as long as they are filling but both of our entrees came with meat (the squash came with Benton's country ham and the shortrib obviously came with shortrib) and I was very disappointed in the amount of meat that was in both entrees. I understand that anything Benton's is expensive, but there were small shaved pieces of country ham that I could barely taste. My husband's shortrib (with shortrib in the entree title) was lacking as well. Both were tasty, but the amount of ingredients just turned me off. Our bill of $80 for mussels, 2 pastas, and 2 glasses of wine didn't seem worth it. I declined dessert only because I had a feeling it was going to be small for what it was too. I wasn't expecting an ""Olive Garden portion"" for this type of restaurant but I've been to similar restaurants with the same menu style and Emilia just didn't live up to my expectations. I won't be in a hurry to come back, and if I do, I might come back with the expectation of enjoying a few app's and a glass of wine on the patio of a nice day vs. for dinner."
emilia-knoxville,Shane S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/9/2018,5.0,"I had the fusilli carbonara and it was absolutely delicious. My date ordered the polenta with meatballs which I tried as well. It, too, was delicious. I would take out of town guests here. It's that good."
emilia-knoxville,Courtney C.,"Knoxville, TN",10/13/2018,5.0,"My absolute favorite reataraunt in Knox. The food is amazing and it's consistent. The staff is friendly and attentive. Great wine, great food, great atmosphere. It's a classier restaurant without the stuffy feeling."
emilia-knoxville,Susan R.,"Boston, MA",9/20/2018,5.0,"This was the a great choice. I am from out of town and this was awesome.  Every course was so delicious.  Highly recommend the olives, grilled romaine salad, and any  pasta dish."
emilia-knoxville,Sergei I.,"North Las Vegas, NV",8/3/2016,5.0,"The best modern Italian food with a twist in town. Out-of-towner - if you want delicious food with attentive staff - think no more. Portions aren't big - this isn't cheesecake factory, folks! But every morsel is tasty. Leave room for desert."
emilia-knoxville,Ryan K.,"Germantown, TN",2/26/2018,1.0,"Reservations apparently don't mean anything here at Emilia... I was planning on taking my fiance out on an anniversary dinner in downtown Knoxville, and made a reservation on OpenTable. We were looking forward to the night, and received a confirmation from the restaurant of our time.... To my surprise, I get an e-mail late the night before our date saying that the reservation was cancelled... WOW. So unprofessional. No explanation or even a phone call as to what happened. Whoever is working here really has a lot to learn. My advice -- don't waste your time with this place. Go somewhere else that will actually honor their reservations."
emilia-knoxville,Alison S.,"Falls Church, VA",12/31/2017,4.0,Awesome meal! A little pricey for the portions but the quality was top notch. Dessert was somewhat underwhelming though. Beautiful rustic decor. Love the ambiance.
emilia-knoxville,Jillian E.,"North Brookfield, MA",11/30/2017,5.0,"We absolutely love this restaurant. We have come two years in a row from New England to have dinner in memory of my daughter, Emilia. The staff has always gone above and beyond to honor Emilia with us, making us feel like part of the family. Killian was our server this year and he was wonderful- very polite and attentive. The meal was delicious and the desserts were divine! We can't wait to return next year. If you are local, definitely check this place out. You won't be disappointed. And try the butterscotch dessert- it's seriously the best thing I've ever had!"
emilia-knoxville,Mark N.,"Charlotte, NC",11/16/2017,5.0,"Phenomenal traditional Italian food. Great service and ambience. We really enjoyed the octopus, fritti and the squid ink ditalini. For the main dish, they had a special twist on carbonara that was a spicy ravioli. Good wine list. Don't miss this gem"
emilia-knoxville,Don H.,"Walland, TN",11/14/2017,4.0,"I was impressed with the service, it was a 10! The food was very upscale. The price was stiff, but if you check the menu a cheaper bottle of wine goes for 40 dollars. Absolutely worth the money and the dinning experience was upscale. Didn't expect the food  to be as good as it was, although the portions where smaller than I wanted. Make a reservation,  otherwise you may wait 20 or 30mts."
emilia-knoxville,Frances H.,"Austin, TX",11/13/2017,5.0,"Squid ink bucatini cut up into teeny pieces accompanied with crab meat was just what I needed and didn't even know it! After a long travel day to Knoxville, Italian food was the perfect idea to comfort my tired soul. Expecting to go with your typical Italian comfort dish, like bolognese and spaghetti with meatballs, I couldn't resist ordering the bucatini special.Before the entree, we went with their Warm Castelvetrano Olives: with Calabrian Chile, Garlic and Thyme and Warm Housemade Foccacia:with Cruze Farm Ricotta, Georgia Olive Oil, Flaky Sea Salt and Fresh Cracked Pepper. Those appetizers might have been my favorite part of the meal; however each bite of the bucatini was better than the one before. I am not sure if it was the perfect al dente texture of the small pieces of squid-ink-covered noodles or the non-overwhelming taste of deliciously rich crab - it was just dang good. The saddest part was my inability to finish the whole dish and that I couldn't take it home for leftovers. The ambiance and service was warm and welcoming, much like you'd get at any Italian dinner with family and friends. I walked away very happy that I got to experience Emilia while in Knoxville."
emilia-knoxville,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",11/12/2017,5.0,Some of the reviews have mentioned small portions. I thought they were portioned well but it depends on what you order because some portions are smaller than others. Just get a salad or an app and you'll be fine. The service was really really good. Our glasses were never empty and as soon as they got a little low someone came around to refill them. They also have a nice wine list and the waitress seemed knowledgeable. The atmosphere was also really nice and it wasn't overly loud. The butterscotch dessert was surprisingly good and I'm looking forward to eating there again so I can try something new.
emilia-knoxville,Eric H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/24/2017,5.0,"Excellent!  Celebrating my 71st. Great service and presentation. Delicious entree. - and desserts!  Of course, being with my bride was icing on the cake."
emilia-knoxville,H R.,"Maryville, TN",10/22/2017,5.0,The vegan mushroom and broccolini pasta was amazing. We will definitely be back. Thank you!
emilia-knoxville,Maggie A.,"Murfreesboro, TN",10/20/2017,5.0,"Wowow can't say enough great stuff about this place! I normally don't review restaurants, but this was, far and away, one of the best meals I've had in Tennessee. The fritto misto appetizer was excellent and fried to perfection. The focaccia and butter were so light and airy that I felt like I wasn't even eating a million carbs! The star of the night was the chicken with salsa verde. Cooked sous vide, every bite just fell off the bone with zero effort. The gnocchi was also excellent and super authentic! We had the limoncello and tiramisu to finish the dinner and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal! The service by Jessica was amazing and she was so  sweet and attentive. On top of that, various servers came by and refilled our water and made sure everything was great! The service and food couldn't have been better and we will definitely be back for more!"
emilia-knoxville,Amye K.,"Knoxville, TN",10/19/2017,5.0,"Go! Just go and see for yourself! Great artisanal cocktail menu, amazing dinner menu. Service is attentive but no one's hovering.  Relaxed pace so you can enjoy a night out without feeling rushed to leave.  All pasta is made in-house.  Everything we had was delicious.  It's always busy so make a reso. Might be a bit on the loud side, not annoying and can't-hear loud but not a quiet spot.  We loved it and will be back."

emilia-knoxville,Beth C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/23/2016,5.0,"I had to plan a work dinner for some out of town guests earlier this week. We wanted to make sure we took them to a nice restaurant ideally in a cool location downtown. Planning for a larger group wasn't easy, and the Open Table reservations wouldn't let me plan for as high as 12 people. When I called, the manager was extremely helpful and accommodating. He said it wouldn't be a problem to have a table for 12 people when we needed it.As often happens with work functions, several people did not show up, but again, the manager was extremely gracious and helpful. He reset the table for the 10 who were there and we were seated promptly. We ordered the artichoke fritti as appetizers and I had the gnocchi. Everything was delicious. Though I didn't try the other dishes, every single person at the table ate their entire dish and had great things to say about all of them. Being in town from Washington D.C., our guests were impressed with the ambiance, the food, and how reasonably priced everything was. I will definitely be going back for a nice dinner."
emilia-knoxville,Joanna C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/29/2017,4.0,The food and service NEVER disappoint but you'll leave hungry. The portions are tiny. I hate the pasta pillows with clams and I promise there were 8 pieces of pasta on my plate. Was it delicious? Sure was! Would have liked more.
emilia-knoxville,Kari W.,"Cincinnati, OH",10/3/2017,4.0,"UPDATE: Food still wonderful, but service on this visit was uncomfortably slow. We arrived very hungry at 8pm WITH a reservation. Restaurant full but not over crowded. Ordered several orders of focaccia and housemade ricotta dip right away.  Took 30 minutes to receive.  Also - the amount of ricotta dip included was a little pathetic.  Arugula salad was too heavily dressed with Truffle oil.   Cavatelli, gnocchi, carbonara and chicken entrees were all amazing!  Desserts were disappointing except for the chocolate Torte which wasn't a torte at all.  The alcohol flavor in the tiramisu overpowered the other flavors.  The Budino tasted ""like a fall yankee candle smells.""  Not very appetizing!  I would still return because the entrees were outstanding."
emilia-knoxville,Kari W.,"Cincinnati, OH",12/22/2016,5.0,"We stumbled upon this place after a drive by quick ""tour"" of UT. Market Square was a really cute little area with ample parking (refreshing!). Emilia was a real treat. We sat at the bar and the bartender and the owner could not have been more pleasant.  We are still dreaming of the house made ricotta spread for the focaccia (I know. It sounds unappetizing, right? It's SO NOT!).  My daughter had the orrichette pasta with bolognese and I had the ""under the brick"" chicken with warm casaveltrano olives.  Both were outstanding.  We can't wait for a reason to go back to Knoxville."
emilia-knoxville,Phyllis E.,"Knoxville, TN",3/3/2018,5.0,"My first visit to this establishment went beyond my expectations. The duck confit dish was done to perfection. We did not have reservations, so we were seated at the bar. Our service was exceptional. Happy to have this quality of cuisine in Knoxville."
emilia-knoxville,Christine P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7/31/2017,5.0,"this restaurant is spectacular.  i was visiting from CA and found this via yelp.  my friends live there and made a reservation easily for the night of.  food was great!  i love fresh made pasta.  we had a few appetizers- bread, warm olives, grilled octopus, mussels- and everything tasted fresh and as if every single bite was important.  cooking and flavors were on point.  the grilled bread was completely to die for.  my main course was the fish stew which was very good and came with a slice of grilled bread to dip in the stew.  service was very good with multiple people coming to help us for random things.  highly recommended restaurant if you're looking for some italian.  however portions are a little small and almost all of us were still hungry even after multiple appetizers, drinks, entrees, and dessert.the music playing that night was not fitting though.  we felt it didn't go well with the food, decor, and ambiance it was going for."
emilia-knoxville,H R.,"Maryville, TN",10/22/2017,5.0,The vegan mushroom and broccolini pasta was amazing. We will definitely be back. Thank you!
emilia-knoxville,Justin W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/14/2017,4.0,"Modern, fresh and italian. I was skeptical at first but my doubts were unfounded. The food is unlike any Italian I've had. The char-grilled broccolini appetizer was incredible, and the pasta was light and flavorful. Also, the rustic atmosphere highlights how different this place is from many other Italian restaurants. Could have used some more space, the tables were a bit crammed, but the service made up for it. I was a little bit surprised by the bill, but all in all I would eat here again."
emilia-knoxville,Teri O.,"Knoxville, TN",1/31/2017,1.0,"So, I called both Thurs and Friday and two different people told me that the bar area was first come first serve. I actually was trying to make a reservation for Saturday -but they didn't offer anything until 8pm. So, figured we'd get there around 5pm(when they open) and get to the bar area. I was told by the hostess that they weren't doing ANY seating until 845pm that night...NONE, Nowhere in the restaurant! Now, I ask...why would you reserve every table (when some people won't show) and turn down other patrons who are there ready to eat or at the least, sit in the bar area? I can't imagine a restaurant not offering ANY tables to walk ins....that just doesn't make sense and in my opinion-bad business sense.I would have loved to try this new restaurant and was looking forward to it. If the hostess was misinformed, she needs to be informed for future. Hopefully, we'll try again during week day and have some luck."
emilia-knoxville,Susan T.,"Knoxville, TN",10/30/2016,3.0,"We liked the food, mostly, although the portions were quite small for the price (good size for me but my husband's dish was even smaller than mine, and he left still hungry). Both of us had pasta dishes which were good, but rather less flavorful than the same dishes we'd made at home (the orichette and the bucatini). We split a very well-prepared appetizer bowl of mussels, and the foccacia bread flavored with fennel was quite nice. Their cocktails were well done, and the house wines are good. A problem is the close proximity of the couples-seating: the tables are about a foot too close together. I just don't enjoy having a waiter's bottom 6"" from my table, or having to hear every word of conversation from the tables on either side...its just too distracting. Our server was very good, and personable, and the atmosphere was convivial but I think we probably won't be back."
emilia-knoxville,Ian G.,"Knoxville, TN",11/12/2016,3.0,"Other than the Stock and Barrel i haven't had much luck eating at the market Square restaurants and Emilia's was no exception. It drives me crazy to eat at an Italian/Continental restaurant and have to pay extra for bread. Salad I'm ok paying extra for but paying extra for bread is almost a non starter for me. We started the meal off with some warm olives and bread. Thought if I ordered the olives then it would come with bread. There was just no way around it, if I wanted a piece of bread I was going to have to pay extra for it. The olives were good. I ordered the meatballs polenta pomodoro. Polenta was very good but the meatballs were kind of hard, not very hot and didn't taste that fresh. Sauce was ok. My wife had the crab pasta dish. I tried her dish and there was very little actual crab. The pasta was kind of bland. Overall the food was ok, a bit pricey, not particularly generous portions and not that tasty.Rustic atmosphere...be careful at night in the winter if you sit near the front door because only one set of doors and it will get cold each time somebody enters or exits the restaurant.***Went back to the restaurant, Emilia's last night and all I can say is that the food was very inconsistent, absolute lack of quality control. We were literally served burnt bread and sent it back.(I wish I took a picture and put it on this review). The meatball dish was barely warm, swimming in a Bolognese sauce that was too salty and also barely warm and the meatballs just didn't seem fresh. My wife's broiled half chicken dish looked very good and she said tasted delicious.I would definitely choose going to Carabas, or Maggionos or Macaroni grill or even the olive garden over this restaurant. Why? Because my food is definitely going to be served hot and although it may be less gourmet and a bit more packaged, it will probably also be fresher.******We are a very diverse family for Knoxville and generally a chain restaurant, even a local chain is more consistent all around. My last comment was made because of that bread they tried to serve us, no excuse***"
emilia-knoxville,Tim B.,"Sterling, VA",7/25/2019,5.0,Incredible!  I had the lobster dish in a corn sauce and it blew me away. The waitresses recommendations were spot on. The butterscotch desert was to die for and the whole meal was not that expensive. Wine pour could have been a little more generous.
emilia-knoxville,Emilia R.,"Fountain Valley, CA",7/28/2017,5.0,This place was delicious. My friend and I always stop in Knoxville on our way to Nashville for dinner and I stopped by here since it's named after me (or so I'd like to believe). My friend is vegan so they made us a vegan pasta dish and it was SO good. Definitely recommend it and this restaurant!
emilia-knoxville,Linda F.,"Asheville, NC",7/20/2017,5.0,"A must stop when in Knoxville. This was our second visit and each was exceptional.  I highly recommend sitting at the bar for dinner. The bartender, wish I had gotten his name, was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the entrees. Not your everyday Italian fare. Unique dishes served in appropriate portions."
emilia-knoxville,Maridely E.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",4/3/2019,5.0,The food taste absolutely fresh  and exquisite. The service was very fast and helpful. The flavors were amazing. Kind of expensive but when in Knoxville try it.
emilia-knoxville,Saray H.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",3/18/2018,2.0,"The presentation of the dish was beautiful as seen in the picture, which only made the disappointment of the taste of the carbonara worse. When I had my first bite of this dish, it was like stuffing a spoonful of salt into my mouth. I have never been served something so salty in my life. Also the waitress completely forgot about giving our table our receipt back for about 15 minutes. Would not recommend."
emilia-knoxville,Fran H.,"Oak Ridge, TN",6/3/2016,3.0,"At this price, ($250 for 3 diners including drinks, tax and tip) I expected much more.  Not sure why it is rated as highly as it is, unless we were there on a very off night.The food was very good.  The service was not.  We had reservations, and were seated immediately.  Our table was not approached for 15 minutes by our server.  At one point before that the hostess took pity on us and poured us waters.  Our server (a condescending female hipster) took our drink order and disappeared for another 15 minutes, then plopped down our drinks and disappeared when we tried to order starters.  We had been there for a solid 45 minutes before our food order was taken.  I ordered a bottle of wine from the wine menu at that time and was told ""we don't sell that kind anymore"" and a sigh as I tried to pick out another bottle while she stood there impatiently.   Well, why is it on your list then?  The drink lists are printed on white copier paper in black ink, you couldn't have updated it?    At this price point, I expect a higher attention to detail.Our cocktails were good.  Pricey, but good.I had the seasonal caprese salad, which I enjoyed.  The portion was definitely more of a tasting portion.   My companions did not care for the grilled romaine salad, which was I think $10 for one romaine leaf with 4 shavings of parmesan and some dressing on top.  We had barely gotten it finished (well, me-my companions stopped eating their salads after a few bites) when our entrées arrived and the server was just standing there while another one had to be called over to clear our plates.  I had the ricotta cavatelli Bolognese.   It was delicious. I agree with some other reviewers that the portion was not what I expected.  I would estimate maybe 1/2-3/4 cup of pasta, on the small side for an entrée.  The portion did not cover 2/3 of the bottom of my bowl.   My companion who got a lamb and pea pasta dish, on the other hand, easily had twice the portion of pasta.  He liked it well enough.  Another companion had the roasted chicken, which he enjoyed but lamented that it was served with only two small slices of potato.  I was not expecting ""olive garden"" size portions, but I didn't expect to still be hungry after two courses, either.At this point, our server disappeared for a long time (30 minutes or more I would say, we had to ask another server to get her so we could order more drinks and dessert). Edit to say:  I wanted to add that the staff members other than our server that we interacted with were very pleasant and professional, the manager filled our wine glasses for us from our bottle and another server (not ours) apologized that our order had not yet been taken. The tiramisu was very average, nothing special.  The salted caramel budino was excellent and was the highlight of my meal.It took nearly 3 hours from start to finish, the pacing needs a lot of work.Overall, 3 stars.  I would probably only go there again if someone else was paying for it because I don't feel the experience was worth the price."
emilia-knoxville,Rachel W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/25/2018,5.0,100% satisfied and so impressed. Valentines Day 4 course meal was perfection. Great service. My no frills steak & potato husband was pleased AND full; I was thinking he would possibly not like the creation or not have enough of a portion size for his taste but he sure did. I am excited to go back for another culinary adventure/treat.
emilia-knoxville,Marie L.,"Atlanta, GA",2/10/2018,5.0,"The food was absolutely amazing. I ordered the one with the duck confit. I don't give high praise often but this entree definitely deserves it. As for the restaurant itself, they did switch my order with that of my neighbor. Thankfully she noticed the issue before I took a bite. Otherwise, everything was perfect. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was nice. I'd recommend going there."
emilia-knoxville,Abby D.,"Denver, CO",3/19/2017,3.0,"An ok place but expensive and confusing. This is TN but the menu reads like LA. I felt  like a needed a translator to order a salad. The pork was fatty, portions SMALL but good. Will I return - nope. Just felt like LA (which I travel to a lot) in knoxville."
emilia-knoxville,Colette L.,"San Antonio, TX",12/11/2016,5.0,"Excellent food with house-made pasta.  Lovely ambiance, but still casual enough to wear jeans.  Stellar service!"
emilia-knoxville,Aaron H.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2016,3.0,"My wife and I went to Emilia about a week after it opened.  It's a beautiful space, that even when it was full, was not too loud.  The tables are cozy with your neighbors, but we found it led us to discuss the meal with people near by, which was enjoyable.  One of the first things I noticed was the absence of a cocktail menu.  It turns out they are still working on a formal menu, but can still make your favorites or create something for you.  We started with the spring caprese salad.  It was bright in flavor with a good slice of savory bread.  We appreciated the chef's devotion to in season produce as the salad was served without tomatoes.  The salad included mozzarella, spring peas, fava beans, asparagus, and I believe some pickled ramps (wasn't sure, they were cut very small).  It was a good and light start to the meal.For the main course we went with two pasta dishes and a side.  I had the Bucatini Carbonara and my wife had the Ricotta Cavatelli Bolognese. We split the broccolini side dish.  The Bucatini had benton's bacon and an egg on top.  It was an enjoyable dish, creamy and filling.  However, it lacked something.  In my opinion, it needed some more seasoning.  Maybe even some fresh ground pepper would've made a significant difference.  Any bite with the bacon was delicious, but without the saltiness of the bacon a bite could be lackluster.  Even some of the savory bread from the caprese salad would've gone a long way in helping this dish, especially in trying to sop up the remaining egg yolk and sauce.  The pasta was al dente and tasty.  With my dish I had the Colosi Rosso.  It was very good, and added some spice and tanginess that the dish needed. My wife's dish, the bolognese, was quite delicious.  The ricotta noodles were delicate, but held their form in the sauce.  The assortment of pork, beef, and veal were tasty.  And even though there were three meats in this dish, they did not overpower the pasta or the sauce.  I found myself wanting to go back to her dish over mine.  The broccolini was very good, I only wish there was a little more of it.Finally, we ordered two deserts, the chocolate and blood orange zeppole and the affogato.  Both were delicious, but if you're looking for a good amount of chocolate in your dessert, you won't find it in the zeppole.  These little ""donuts"" were light, fluffy, with a crispy outside and the blood orange sauce was a blast of citrus to cut the sweet donuts. No real complaints here, but did miss a bold chocolate flavor, but this was more of a misplaced expectation than the makings of a subpar dish. The affogato was creamy with good espresso flavor, The ""cracker"" served with it had good flavor, but its texture was a bit odd.  It lacked a true crispiness and without the crunch of the pistachios would've been a bit a of a mess. Overall, this was a solid meal, but I feel like if it was in a different city...one better known for it's food, it might not stand out.  The dishes were good, but not great.  I felt like prices were appropriate, but some will probably say you don't get enough portion for your penny.  I think this more due to portions being too large at other places than too small here.  I feel like this place might do well as ""foodies"" look for new experiences in Knoxville, but I hope even the locals who enjoy more traditional meals will find something they love here.  I would go back, but would look for some improvement.   My wife and I LOVE Knox Mason (same chef/owner I believe) and would prefer it over Emilia.  We are excited to have this Italian eatery in Market square and look forward to another visit.My wife would give it 4/5 stars, I was thinking 3/5.  Rated at 3/5 overall in hopes of creating room for improvement. Worth a try, will be back."
emilia-knoxville,Tom R.,"Danbury, CT",8/13/2017,4.0,"Went there on a Friday night with my sister and brother-in-law and had a great time. Started with a caprese salad and it was incredibly fresh. My sister started with a grilled salad, which I tasted. Killer. Never seen that on a menu before. My brother-in-law got the octopus app and was pleased. I couldn't look at it. Over a nice bottle of red, we ate risotto and pasta. My risotto was with tomatoes and bacon and parmesan. Absolutely fresh and delicious. Service was top-notch. Our server was engaging, attentive and helpful. Others made sure our water glasses and wine glasses stayed filled. Dessert menu was unimpressive so we skipped. Nice atmosphere and location; I definitely recommend."
emilia-knoxville,Garry O.,"Brookline, MA",1/20/2018,5.0,Great food! Great service! Bridget was a super waitress who guided us through a menu filled with delicious choices AND providing superb service
emilia-knoxville,Sheena R.,"Knoxville, TN",9/4/2016,5.0,"Some of the best food we've had in Knoxville! I had the gnocchi and my husband had the ribeye. Both were phenomenal and the service was wonderful too! The decor is great too, almost feels like you've left Knoxville and gone to Italy for a bit :)  We will definitely be back!"
emilia-knoxville,Steve S.,"CONCORD FARR, TN",4/25/2019,2.0,"We found Emilia much the same as David F.'s review and frankly am surprised at the glowing reviews of others.  I would attribute this to the staff having a bad night but the problems really are more systemic.  My wife chose this restaurant based on the great reviews and innovative menu options.  That said, upon arrival we were seated initially at a tiny table right beside the bathrooms and kitchen.  As we didn't wish to have constant traffic we asked if there was a different table which we were graciously moved to.  This was a mistake on our part tho as we were moved to the front along the wall.  No big deal except the wall seats  literally consist of a wooden bench running the length of the wall, with my chair being only slightly better.  The tables as mentioned are tiny and spaced about 10"" from the neighboring table. So not only is the seating  uncomfortable but you get to be privy to your neighbors conversations.  This was the norm throughout the dining area.  Getting to the food and cocktails.  My wife had the Agave Negroni, which was nice but my Sambuca Sazarac surprisingly lacked the normal sweetness which resulted in a lifeless drink.  Moving to appetizers, I had the Spanish Octopus which was chewy and flavorless while my wife had the Smoked Burrata which again was lacking in flavor except for  it being topped with either thinly sliced shallot or red onion that was so sharp that it overwhelmed the dish. It basically amounted to rather oily cheese toast.  I suspect the staff must not be tasting their ingredients.  The main dishes saved the day as my wife had the Pollo a Matonne which she enjoyed, especially the olive sauce and I had the Pork Blade Steak which was simple but quite nice.  Complements for the prosciutto wrapped fennel which was a tasty accompaniment.  Overall we came away judging our meal as a C+ to B-, in other words a decent but we likely will not return."
emilia-knoxville,Lisa G.,"Franklin, TN",4/28/2017,5.0,Tried for the first time before a show. Love the vibe and the atmosphere. Good service. Very reasonably priced wine list. Our entree was amazing - we both got the chicken and it was delicious. Looking forward to trying other items. Really nice addition to downtown. I could actually order something semi-healthy which was refreshing.
emilia-knoxville,Robin M.,"Lenoir City, TN",5/19/2017,5.0,"We love love love Emilia. Reservations are a must, especially on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. My husband and I ate there once and returned the following week with friends. There's a good variety of appetizers, salads, pasta and non-pasta entrees as well as a nice selection of wines. Oh, and desserts. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The servers are very knowledgeable and willing to share their opinions with you - we like that. We're more than happy to recommend Emilia."
emilia-knoxville,Dam G.,"Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA",5/14/2017,5.0,"the pastas were amazing, the wine was flowing and the service was incredible. Can't ask for more from an italian restaurant, Definitely want to return with friends and colleagues."
emilia-knoxville,Alyse W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/8/2017,4.0,"I love the food here so much. I think my fiancé is sick of me suggesting it for date nights! I have gotten the bolognese a couple of times and have tried other rotating dishes as well. All have been wonderful! The focaccia with ricotta is one of my favorite things ever. I dropped a star for them only because I have had spotty service there, but otherwise I've always enjoyed myself!"
emilia-knoxville,Gordon Y.,"Wixom, MI",1/22/2019,5.0,After a play we decided to go visit downtown Knoxville. As we walked through market Square we wonder Devon this lovely restaurant. Being new to the area we checked reviews and saw they were very good. In the end we were lucky to find a table at 5 p.m. Are evening was great the food excellent and the service was quick courteous and fun.
emilia-knoxville,John S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/12/2020,5.0,"A while back I did a post on a lower budget, family friendly Knoxville Italian restaurant, and I made the statement that Knoxville struggles with Italian. Well, this place has broken my perception. I would say that it is one of the best meals on Market Square, and I believe the best Italian in K-town. After our first meal there, which was 3 courses, the waitress asked if there was anything else we wanted, and I told her that I wanted to do the entire meal again starting from the top. Of course my wife would not allow this to happen. Beef Bolognese is just outstanding and the gnocchi with scallops is my wife's go to. The atmosphere is what they would call cozy, but I just think it is loud. I am probably just an old guy that likes a little quieter space. The portion sizes are a little small, but there are so many solid choices on their menu I like to think of it as a place where I can try several dishes in an evening. I am rambling. Great food and great service."
emilia-knoxville,Sue H.,"Jackson, TN",9/23/2016,5.0,"Emilia was a delightful experience. Our server, Megan, was nice and helpful. We ordered the grilled romaine and really liked it. Also got the bread and ricotta spread. It was good, too. I got the lump crab risotto and it was delicious. Husband got a pasta dish with pork, beef and veal. It was outstanding, too. It's pricey, but you get what you pay for."
emilia-knoxville,K P.,"Charlotte, NC",1/20/2019,5.0,"We came here with a group and had a wonderful experience!  Our waitress was warm and knowledgeable, and they were happy to accommodate our daughters with smaller portions of more familiar pasta dishes.  The adults all loved our meals -- I had a seasonal squash ravioli which was delicious! The food was great and the hospitality was even better."
emilia-knoxville,Tyler B.,"Knoxville, TN",2/17/2019,5.0,Awesome experience! The local fresh ingredients make this place stand out over all the rest! The menu choice is the most authentic selection and flavors I've ever had. Absolutely recommend!!
emilia-knoxville,Tom L.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2019,5.0,"Just outstanding. First visit. Had mussels to start. Buttery and fresh. Had Bolognese  as entree. Absolutely authentic. Marrow adds to gravy taste. Wife had Polenta and meatballs - again, on the money. Fresh, soft meatballs and amazing tasing gravy. Solid list of reasonable Piedmont and Tuscan wines. Finished with Tiramisu. Been to the best in NYC, Boston North end and even Roma and Tuscany. On line with any meal I've had over last 3-4 years."
emilia-knoxville,Mercy D.,"Miami, FL",12/29/2016,5.0,We found Emilia based on Yelp. We weren't disappointed. The service was exceptional. The food was too. Everything we ate was different in some way from the normal stuff you get at an Italian restaurant. The pizza dough appetizer was delicious. It's made to resemble a pudding like texture. Thankfully nothing like we expected and amazing. The mushroom risotto was divine and the fusilli pasta carbonara was delectable. Our server was Megan S and she was excellent. All of her suggestions were on point and we left there extremely pleased with having dined there. The prices we also very reasonable. We paid twice that at a restaurant on this trip in another city and state for bland and mediocre food. I always know when a restaurant is good if the food and overall experience was memorable and this place is definitely that...memorable.
emilia-knoxville,Lana S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/15/2016,4.0,"I love Emilia's! I love the pasta, great service, great wine & ambiance enjoy it all!! Oh & that butterscotch dessert thing. Yum! Cheers!"
emilia-knoxville,Kelly F.,"Maryville, TN",6/20/2016,5.0,"Loved this place. We ate ""Chinese restaurant style"" and I'd recommend that! We (party of 4) shared a few appetizers, several pasta dishes and one entree. Just about everything was excellent. Some of the pasta dishes were to die for. I think we made a good choice to share the pork potbelly entree; it might be a bit too much for one person as the main part of their meal, but for a few to share it-- excellent.I never remember the names of dishes; just let me repeat that about everything we had was delicious. One of the desserts didn't hit me (some type of doughnut with blood orange sauce), but others at the table said it was OK for them; I loved the caramel and chocolate dessert.Drinks: We had beer and mixed drinks, so I don't know about wine or wine prices. I would suggest if you want to have a few drinks, you might stop elsewhere before or after on the Square-- for example I had an excellent and well-priced drink at Not-Watsons across the way, at a much better price, before we moved on to Emilia's.EXCELLENT PLACE-- we'll be back for sure!"
emilia-knoxville,Debbie C.,"Harrisburg, PA",12/29/2016,5.0,"Absolutely delicious! Focaccia, arugula pear salad, bucatini, and all the dessert. Best Italian we've had since moving from NY."
emilia-knoxville,Kelly B.,"Knoxville, TN",11/25/2016,5.0,"We were celebrating 2 family birthdays & went on Black Friday.  We had 7 in our party & ordered lots of grilled romaine salads & pastas.  Don't miss the focaccia with fresh ricotta--it's amazing!  Service from Killian was perfect--couldn't ask for anything more!  We got 2 desserts & port, they were also great.  Perfect birthday dinner!"
emilia-knoxville,Aaron S.,"Knoxville, TN",5/10/2019,1.0,"We sat at the bar and had a difficult time getting the bartender's attention. We were finally able to order snacks...that is all we were able to order. Despite trying to make eye contact with the bartenders, we were completely ignored and looked over for at least 15 minutes. When trying to cash out, we were asked if everything was ok. I responded no and explained that we had been considered an afterthought. Rather than apologizing, the bartender became argumentative. The owner came by, who I thought was a bartender because he had been behind the bar chatting the whole time. He informed us that they were short staffed and where we were sitting was ""overflow"" seating. If I had known we would be treated as less than a normal patron I would have never came in. I wasn't aware that there were different classes of seating here. He apologized that we were disappointed but didn't acknowledge that they provided terrible service. He said that he thought we were content because we had food in front of us. I wasn't aware that we needed to completely finish our appetizer before ordering anything else. I read a lot of bogus reviews, but seriously please avoid this restaurant. They are very unprofessional and have a reputation of catering only to the well-to-do."
emilia-knoxville,Lisa P.,"Nashville, TN",7/19/2018,5.0,"We walked in and almost walked out because of the strong smell of sewage. Turns out this is an issue going on throughout the Market Square area in Knoxville and is no fault of the restaurant. But the city needs to figure this out because it's hurting businesses and the people who work there. We asked to be seated in the back and eventually the incredible smells from the kitchen blocked out the sewage smell. OK, that rant is over. Back to the amazing food. Our waitress was Bridget and she was charming, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable regarding the menu. I recently have had to remove all gluten from my diet. She let me know that they actually have a dedicated fryer for those who have gluten allergies. It was so exciting to be able to eat something fried! We had the frito misto (fried shrimp, fish, fennel, lemon, etc.), grilled octopus, beets, okra, and a gluten free pasta dish with lamb sausage. We would rate every dish as an A or A- and we are pretty picky. I also had a fabulous cocktail that was a play on a Negroni. Factoring in the food, service, and the great drink, this was an A+ experience. I visit Knoxville two or three times a year and will be returning here every time."
emilia-knoxville,Roseann M.,"New Haven, CT",4/27/2017,5.0,Fabulous service and a great vegan pasta dish. A rare combination. Oh and great primitivo
emilia-knoxville,Michelle C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/20/2016,5.0,"Knoxville needed a good Italian restaurant & thankfully Emelia's showed up!!! Great food selections with good, friendly service and nice wine selections. We enjoyed the caprese salad, lump crab risotto & orchiette. Will definitely be returning."
emilia-knoxville,Martin T.,"New Orleans, LA",6/22/2018,2.0,"I had the grilled octopus, the gnocchi amatriciana, asparagus and wine. Everything was fine but not worth the price. The octopus was pretty small for $15. The sauces were ok but a bit boring. I was happy that the gnocchi tasted homemade. I didn't notice much meat in the gnocchi which made it feel like they were pinching pennies. The service was friendly. Good atmosphere."
emilia-knoxville,Tyler R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/29/2016,4.0,My wife and I had dinner here for her birthday and we really enjoyed it. The food was fresh and perfectly cooked. I intended on ordering the pork belly but they had sold out. Our waitress recommended the pork chop and I can't remember ever having one better. The fresh focaccia to start the meal was also a really nice touch. Definitely recommended if you're downtown and in the mood for some Italian.
emilia-knoxville,Ana C.,"Fort Mill, SC",8/5/2016,5.0,Awesome food & worth the wait!!  Our server Brittany provided us with great service so this evening's dinner couldn't have gone any better. We will be back!!
emilia-knoxville,Joanne L.,"Knoxville, TN",7/29/2016,5.0,"What a great addition to Market Square. Unbelievably delicious food. I had the Pollo 'a Mattone' and it was fabulous. The reduction sauce was the tastiest ever. And absolutely the best tiramisu that I have had in my life, and I grew up near an Italian neighborhood! Service was excellent - so prompt and professional."
emilia-knoxville,David S.,"Little Rock, AR",5/31/2018,1.0,"We went due to all the positive reviews. Food was subpar at best. My sons girlfriend ordered just plain pasta with butter and cheese. They brought out maybe a handful of pasta in a bowl and charged us 15.00, a little steep for 5 cents worth of pasta. I had meatballs with polenta and I've had better from Sam's Club that came froze in a bag.  Polenta was obviously some type of industrial brand generic just add water. This is not authentic real Italian and not particularly fresh. Wife had some type of brick oven chicken and it was just terrible."
emilia-knoxville,Janlyn M.,"Knoxville, TN",11/11/2016,1.0,Menu is pretentious- service spotty- observed several violations of the food safety code - food was not served at the proper temperature - entrees greatly over priced- better choices elsewhere
emilia-knoxville,Judy W.,"VA, VA",9/28/2018,5.0,"AMAZING!!!! One of the best meals we've ever had in a restaurant, anywhere! Our server, Elise, was delightful, and so knowledgeable.  The octopus was delicious and so was the burrata. Loved the Brussels sprouts and all of the pastas!  The gnocchi was the best I've ever eaten and the summer squash/ricotta agnolotti was fabulous! My husband got the meatballs, they were also amazing. Butterscotch pudding for dessert surpassed our expectations. The service was second to none and the staff so friendly. Thank you Elise and Emilia staff!!  We will be back!!!"
emilia-knoxville,Erik D.,"Detroit, MI",8/4/2016,4.0,Took a customer there for dinner. Nice atmosphere and great service. Very prompt. My customer dropped a piece of silverware and two staff members where there instantly. One to pick it up the other to replace it. Our waitress gave us suggestions which where spot on.  I had the lump crab pasta& it was great.  Great service and food.
emilia-knoxville,Tim E.,"Franklin, TN",5/5/2016,4.0,A great addition to the Knoxville scene. Atmosphere is fantastic. Food was some of the best I have had in Knoxville. This needs to be on the top of your list. We were there the second day they were open and you would have thought they had been open for months.
emilia-knoxville,Serge I.,"Manhattan, NY",7/21/2016,5.0,Great Italian food. Pasta is homemade. Great service with knowledgeable servers. Feels like Brooklyn a bit. Tasty risotto and tempting dessert. Don't miss it if you're in Knoxville.
emilia-knoxville,William B.,"Winston-Salem, NC",12/29/2016,5.0,Genuinely one of the best dining experiences I've had. Follow the advice of the servers and expect to spend a pretty big chunk of money but leave very happy.
emilia-knoxville,Jeff A.,"Ewing, VA",11/25/2018,3.0,I don't want to bore everybody with a long winded review but we had a overall good experience. The pluses were the service and food. The minuses were the quantities which were lacking and the price was way too high for the area and cuisine. The appetizers were good having the brussel sprouts and bread with butter. Again very expensive based on portions. Plus I travel all over the world and have never been to a Italian restaurant that doesn't serve bread free with the meal. No sides are included as vegetables or salad. I have my two sons and wife there and we all left hungry for $130.00 tip included. Wont be back with too many other choices that are more reasonable. Somebody there has not done their homework or doesn't read these reviews or doesn't care or all three! lol
emilia-knoxville,Monica C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/21/2018,4.0,"I have had dinner at Emilia's at least five times in the last seven months. I think the restaurant's ambience is wonderful. It's a place you can sit for hours drinking wine and telling stories with your friends/loved ones. The gray wash brick walls are perfect. I usually get appetizers and a pasta. They offer olives as an app. This is really good if you're getting more than one appetizer or your not that hungry. The olives are green, served warm with some rosemary. I wasn't impressed but it's still yummy. I like the ricotta cheese and oil. Very tasty. My favorite pasta is the carbonara with the poached egg on the noddles and Benton's bacon chunks. It's a very simple, light and fluffy pasta. It will fill you up. It's delicious. I've tried other pastas but this one is the only pasta worth talking about. I haven't had the meatballs with polenta yet but it was quite tasty when I tried my friend's. To close out the night, make sure to order the lemoncello they make in-house. They make it real good."
emilia-knoxville,Scott W.,"Powell, TN",10/13/2018,3.0,"Food, including appetizers was great.  Small portion if main dish.  However service slow and required requesting an item twice only to receive it at the end of the meal.  Very disappointed with the service but taste  presentation of main course and atmosphere are acceptable.  One final point avoid the bar stools, too small!"
emilia-knoxville,Rhonda P.,"Knoxville, TN",5/13/2016,5.0,"First time diners. We will be back. From cocktails to dessert, everything was fantastic. Friendly service. If any thing, the mains came out a little quickly.  But all in all, excellent portions of fabulous food."
emilia-knoxville,Dean B.,"Knoxville, TN",5/9/2016,5.0,"I loved everything about Emilia except the location. While Market Sq is a popular destination, Emilia feels a bit out of place in this semi-carnival environment. Wished they had secured a location more fitting with their food and atmosphere. It won't stop me from returning, just not as frequently."
emilia-knoxville,Megan B.,"Charleston, SC",6/5/2016,5.0,"The food was very good. We did try the focaccia with ricotta and that was delicious. My husband and brother in law thought the portions were small and they were expecting a bread basket at the table, like most Italian restaurants in this area do. Our waitress was very nice, but you could tell they were short staffed for a Saturday night, as the manager was also running food and clearing courses. I had the butterscotch pudding for desert and was very impressed- it was very unique and so delicious. For my entree, I had the bolognese and loved it. It was really flavorful and the pasta was delicious. My husband loved his carbonara dish too. Overall, this is a really nice addition to Market Square. I love Italian food and this is a very different type of Italian restaurant that I am excited to have in Knoxville!"
emilia-knoxville,Coco B.,"Knoxville, TN",9/8/2018,5.0,Best birthday dinner. Killian made the experience Great!! Matt the owner is an awesome dude
emilia-knoxville,Steve M.,"Stafford, VA",3/2/2018,5.0,"Absolutely fabulous food and service. I highly recommend the mussels, chicken, duck and amaretto semifreddo... worth every calorie!"
emilia-knoxville,Eric H.,"Knoxville, TN",10/24/2017,5.0,"Excellent!  Celebrating my 71st. Great service and presentation. Delicious entree. - and desserts!  Of course, being with my bride was icing on the cake."
emilia-knoxville,Jennifer H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/17/2016,5.0,"Delicious, high quality food!  Customer service very good! Most restaurants lack this, Emilia's goes over the top. We ordered Campenelle Primavera and Lobster Risotto both packed with great flavor. Very summery dishes as well as affordable. Great asset to market square!"
emilia-knoxville,Jim S.,"Old Northside, Indianapolis, IN",7/20/2017,5.0,"On our way to another destination, we spent the night in Knoxville. We searched around for a good restaurant and were delighted to find this one. Chef-owned and driven, and Italian, that's about as good as we could hope for. Because we like lots of tastes, we ordered from each major grouping on the menu, sharing every dish. We started with the octopus which was grilled and delicious! We moved then to an arugula salad with parmigiana reggiano and truffles? While we did not believe or see the truffles, we at least believe there was truffle oil. And, in any event, it was very tasty. Next we ordered the agnolotti with corn, trumpet mushrooms and fresca ricotta (because we thought it would be lighter). That dish, too, was outstanding. Our secondi was the 1/2 bricked chicken - my wife's favorite preparation! This may have been the best dish we had. Finally, my wife is a nut about pana cotta and this one did not disappoint. We paired it all with a Sardinian rosato which was perfect with almost each of the dishes. We found out that the chef had been at the Inn at Blackberry Farms for an extended period before founding this place (and it showed). We had first class service from Killian and Caroline (the front of the house manager and soon to be som). And, importantly for us, the restaurant had a great vibe. When we are in Knoxville again, we will definitely be back."
emilia-knoxville,Ken W.,"Nashville, TN",6/1/2018,4.0,"Great fresh pastas. Brought a crew here after UTK orientation looking for good pasta and we were not disappointed. Several had the roasted chicken entree and thought it was excellent, most of us had pasta and were very pleased. Definitely will go back."
emilia-knoxville,Blair P.,"Washington, DC",5/14/2016,5.0,Excellent pasta and great staff. The Butterscotch Budino is excellent. Definitely worth a visit!
emilia-knoxville,Stef C.,"Laurel, MD",8/12/2017,4.0,Stopped in with a group of 7 without a reservation on a Thursday night around 6:30. Got seated right away tho the place filled up quickly. Nice atmosphere. Good place for conversation with new and old friends. Food wasn't memorable (except the grilled romaine appetizer which was great) but it was good as was the price. I'd go back.
emilia-knoxville,Jon A.,"Knoxville, TN",6/11/2016,5.0,"What a delightful experience.My wife and I celebrated her birthday at Emilia last night, along with four of our friends.  Everything about our dinner was wonderful.  The atmosphere was charming, the service was exemplary (thanks Courtney!), and the food was delicious.  I so enjoyed the arugula salad that one of us ordered as a starter that I had to order another.  The caprese salad was also quite tasty.  Contrary to my ordering habits I ordered the salmon as my entree, because it just sounded too good to pass on.  I'm glad I did, because it was fantastic.  My wife ordered the potato gnocchi primavera, and she couldn't stop raving about it.  She actually said that it was one of the best meals she has ever eaten.We look forward to going back to Emilia very soon.  Thanks for a wonderful birthday dining experience!"
emilia-knoxville,Molly J.,"Knoxville, TN",4/1/2018,4.0,"Great food and efficient service in a modern, Italian atmosphere.  Fantastic Italian wines served by attentive, knowledgeable bar staff.  Food is equally fantastic if you pick well from the menu - highlights are the homemade pastas and focaccia bread.   Some dishes miss the mark slightly - eg. the polenta with meatballs is bland."
emilia-knoxville,Emily K.,"Chattanooga, TN",6/29/2017,5.0,Super! Courtney made us feel very much at home. The gnocchi is top notch. The grilled caesar is a must. The foccocia bread...no brainer. Scott made me an amazing espresso martini. I will be back next time I'm in Knoxville!
emilia-knoxville,Derek H.,"Knoxville, TN",11/12/2016,3.0,"Food was good. Be aware that the pasta dishes are not entree size. They are the size of a first course, not a main course. You'll still need to order off the entree menu to have a full meal with pasta. Some of the other menu items are smaller portions also. The steak though, is a good size being 12oz. The prices are a bit out of line for what you get with some of the items, but this is not a chain restaurant, so don't expect those portion sizes or prices. Keep this in mind, it may not for everybody because you will have to order several things & spend more money to get a full meal. But overall, I was pleased with my dining experience."
emilia-knoxville,Geoff R.,"Washington, DC",8/23/2017,2.0,"Could have been a better experience.  The appetizer was fine (fried artichoke), but my main dish was disappointing.  Salmon that was blah, served on a risotto bed that was less than delicious.  How is it possible to make undelicious risotto?  This restaurant's idea was to use a bulky kind of rice that just didn't work well.  Granted, the waiter had not singled this dish out as a great recommendation, but when asked if it was good, indicated that it was.  Would have been wiser to warn against this dish.  The prices here were strikingly high for the quality of what was served.  And most striking of all was the nervousness of the waiter, who had a hard time explaining the menu and then at the end hovered around the check, seemingly very eager to collect and get us to go, even though it was closing time and no new customers could be seated, and there were plenty of straggling other diners still around.  Maybe this was a new employee."
emilia-knoxville,Craig S.,"Norris, TN",5/4/2016,5.0,"Emilia will quickly make the short list of must-try restaurants in downtown Knoxville.  And after you try it, you'll go back!  This is not another cookie-cutter restaurant concept.  This is homemade, farm-raised ingredients, and inventive flavors.  We started with mussels and the housemade focaccia.  Mussels were cooked just right and the ricotta that is served with the focaccia is out of this world.  Their homemade pastas are amazing with some very rich, unique sauces.  We tried the Campanelle with Braised Lamb and Spring Peas.  Amazing!  The Pollo 'A Mattoon' featured a perfectly cooked chicken quarter with a great sear on the skin.  The green olive sauce was a great finish to the dish, but not over-powering.  The atmosphere is also very good.  Fairly minimalist (like the restaurant's cousin Knox Mason), but it works well for business dinners or just fun with friends.  We are already planning our next visit!"
emilia-knoxville,Pate M.,"Nashville, TN",9/4/2016,2.0,"Nice atmosphere. Menu helpfully notes vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. Unfortunately the vegan options are few and the chef was unable to come up with a vegan entree when asked, so I had a few vegan appetizers which were very mediocre. Omnivores seem to enjoy this place but vegans are advised to dine elsewhere."
emilia-knoxville,M L.,"Wadsworth, IL",3/24/2017,5.0,Food was delicious; the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. They even gave me a free sample of wine!  Look forward to returning and trying more entrees.
emilia-knoxville,Andrew G.,"Hornell, NY",5/7/2017,5.0,I was in TN 2 weeks ago for work so late reply but I had too. But whoaa!! Delicious pasta in TN!!  I am from LA and I was really surprise to find this place here. All pasta is handmade not from a cardboard box. I can't recall what I ordered as i am too lazy ro sreach on the menu but it was corkscrew type of pasta with lump of egg and a fine glass of red CA wine ..oh geez it was heaven on earth to find this place in Knoxville.
emilia-knoxville,Greg G.,"Maryville, TN",2/24/2017,5.0,We went for a family birthday dinner and we were not let down. The food was excellent from the carbonara to the salmon. Portions are not huge but enough and very high quality.   We each had one of the different desserts and everyone left extremely happy. I personally liked the Butterscotch dessert the best.
emilia-knoxville,Abraham B.,"Westwood, MA",6/17/2016,5.0,"Had a lovely meal at Emilia tonight. The decor was simple, not overdone. I do prefer white tablecloths which were missing, I suspect to make it feel more casual. The olives and focaccia were great as starters, like many nicer restaurant the bread won't be free. We chose one pasta and two entrees to share between three people which was ample. All of the dishes were quite good, we had the chicken and salmon, though I'd like to see a bigger selection of entrees. The wine recommendation of the server was quite good and the dessert ok, we had a coffee ice cream. All and all a lovely meal and especially pleased to have a unique, locally owned restaurant rather than a chain."
emilia-knoxville,Paul H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/20/2016,5.0,"We had a wonderful dinner here!!  We were going to an 8pm concert so our reservations were at 6pm.  I wanted to allow time to dine and enjoy dinner before the show.  We had amazing service throughout dinner and it was very busy on a Tuesday evening!!  We started with the grilled romaine Caesar salad.  Wonderful grilled flavor in the romaine and a mild dressing and the cheese was so good.  Very different from the traditional Caesar but it work...very light.   We also got the focaccia bread....wonderful!!  Wanted more but pulled myself back.  We split entrees.  We had the veal, beef and pork bolognese with a shell shaped pasta!!  I could have ordered another one because it was so good!!!  Very rich and full of flavor!  My friends split the ribeye steak.  I have to say that the flavor they put in the ribeye was like nothing I have tasted.  I wanted more!!  It did have a pad of fat along the edge of the ribeye that my friend would not touch!!  I ate along that part and that is what a ribeye is all about!!  We split 2 desserts.  The butterscotch pudding and the coffee flavor ice cream.  Both are very good and would order them again.  I WILL be back!!"
emilia-knoxville,Karen D.,"Clarksville, TN",2/19/2017,3.0,"Way overpriced. Good food but nothing spectacular, small portions. We were all still hungry afterwards. Service was good."
emilia-knoxville,Shalini M.,"Metairie, LA",5/4/2018,4.0,"I would have given this unexpected gem 5 stars if they hadn't tried to seat us at the worst table in the restaurant which was next to the kitchen when there were several 2 tops open in the front of the restaurant... it was only 6:15. I asked to be moved to a better table and was accommodated. But then after ordering the arugula salad as my appetizer and the lamb sausage pasta as my entree, my entree came out first and my salad was forgotten. My salad was brought to me when I was almost done with my entree. The salad was average... nothing mind blowing... it could have used some nuts and may be some sweetness of a fruit perhaps. The pasta on the other hand was perhaps the best pasta I've eaten in my life! I would go back just for this dish. I was charged for the salad which I feel should have been comped. This place seems to have a slight chip on their shoulder because it probably is one of the best restaurants in Knoxville. There is no need to be pretentious... kindness and generosity goes a long way! This is not meant to criticize the owner or the chefs but mainly the hostesses that sat us at the worst table and the waitress that forgot to put my salad order in."
emilia-knoxville,Ann F.,"Alpharetta, GA",7/15/2016,5.0,"We Lved Emilia's!! Quaint, rustic atmosphere! Great wine list! Great service!! Food was wonderful!!! We especially enjoyed the focaccia bread with homemade ricotta, the grilled romaine salad and their pasta dishes!!"
emilia-knoxville,Hamilton H.,"Clinton, TN",10/22/2016,3.0,"Nice new restaurant, with some very good wine selections.  Food was nothing spectacular, pricey, and probably not going back."
emilia-knoxville,Brandi L.,"Manchester, TN",7/11/2016,5.0,This is one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever eaten at! Everything was sooooo delicious! I ordered the vegetarian pasta. I do not remember the name of it but it was a campanelle. The pasta and the flavor of the sauce was exceptional! We order the foccacia bread with whipped ricotta as well. Very good!! I can not wait to visit this restaurant again when we are back in Knoxville!
emilia-knoxville,Roger S.,"Knoxville, TN",6/21/2016,4.0,Enjoyable dinner spot in downtown Knoxville. The house made pasta was fantastic. Fresh and tasty. Loved the focaccia bread. We'll be back.
emilia-knoxville,Andrew O.,"New York, NY",7/9/2016,5.0,"Had an excellent dinner experience here. We arrived a little early for our reservations but were seated promptly. Started with the Chickpea Fries and the Focaccia with Cruze ricotta, both were very nicely done. Also had the BFB Classic Saison, which one should never pass up. For the main course our table ordered the Gnocchi, the Orecchiette Bolognese, and the Pollo 'a Mattone'. The Gnocchi was very tender and cooked perfectly, pairing well with the sauce. The Bolognese was one of the best I have had anywhere. Rich, complex, but without any one overpowering component. Just a very well balanced sauce. The Pollo 'a Mattone' was far beyond your average, boring chicken dish. It was excellently executed, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. An all-around delicious dish with a very generous portion size that, paired with other courses, would be plenty for two. We finished the evening with an order of the Chocolate Zeppole and the Butterscotch Budino. Both were very tasty, and to us seemed to be an appropriate portion size after 3 prior courses. All in all, it was a great experience. The food was great, the wait staff very attentive, and a nice atmosphere to boot. We will be back very soon. Thanks to Chef Matt for another great contribution to the Knoxville restaurant scene!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Maddie K.,"TN, TN",7/21/2022,5.0,"Fantastic pizza, service, and wines. I always have an amazing night out at this spot, and it's definitely worth the price. Good pizza is hard to find in Knoxville for me since I'm used to Chicago-style deep dish and thin crust. I love this spot so much and it's always a wonderful time!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,John B.,"Lexington, KY",8/23/2022,5.0,"This is a reservations kind of place that is only open for dinner, but is open seven days a week. It is a bit removed from the touristy downtown part of the city, which has the advantage of making this location easy to drive to and full of free parking, but it is a tad sketch. I managed to sneak in at the beginning of the day without a reservation.The menu offers a good variety of ways to get your vegetables in, and I ended up bypassing the spicy greens pizza in favor of something called a ruchetta, which came with abundant arugula and a heap of delightfully shaved cheese freshly on top. The crust is a tad sour, but it was overwhelmed by the flavor of the sauce. I was happy with my choice to get calabrian chili on the side and use it as a dipper for the crust. My salad was gigantic and very filling; I only finished half of it, in part because I wanted to save room for house gelato. The Nutella delivered the smoothness and flavor I was hoping for.My night was improved by splendid service (from Hannah, if anyone in management reads these things). I got up for five minutes to go to the bathroom, and already my bag was deposited in safe storage because they were afraid I left without it. Efficient service is important for a busy restaurant, but I was never rushed and received engaging recommendations. I have never lived in Knoxville or anywhere near it, but as a traveler I'd had this place on my list for a while, and it's about time I finally made it in."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Starr D.,"Washington, DC",8/1/2022,5.0,"Save space for the homemade gelato!!! And must make reservations...that's all you need to remember LOLGreat atmosphere, modern, vibrant, delicious foods, great wine selections, wonderful service. We came from out of town, of course didn't know we needed to make a reservation for even when they just opened for dinner. Glad they were able add us to the waitlist and finally got us a table after 45min of wait. Truly enjoyed our experience here, highly recommend!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Tayler K.,"Los Angeles, CA",7/15/2022,3.0,"Last year, a bunch of my coworkers discovered A Dopo pizza and raved about their spectacular sourdough crusted pizzas. After several weeks of hearing phenomenal reviews I finally drove out and got a pizza to go as I didn't feel comfortable dining in because of Covid at the time. (I should mention, my job tests for Covid every single day, it's not me being paranoid.) Anyway, bringing the pizza home, the pizza in my opinion, was just ""ok"", not really all that ""spectacular"".  So, I deduced that maybe you just had to eat it at the restaurant while it was fresh out of the oven. Fast forward to 2 days ago, I ordered the ""special of the day"", which consisted of pepperoni, ricotta cheese, basil in their red sauce. The pizza was superb and very delicious. Definitely a different eating experience hot out of the oven. The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because their wait staff were all wearing politically viewed t-shirts. One said something about supporting planned parenthood, another stated that abortion was a woman's right of some sort, etc. I come from a liberal state (California), I don't agree with all the politics that is being exercised there and I don't want to be badgered by wait staff and their political viewing t-shirts. I want to enjoy a good meal with good friends at a nice restaurant. I don't need abortion rights advertisement with my meal. My friends and I felt pretty uncomfortable. I'm a Christian and believe that a baby's life begins with a heart beat. My one friend has tried invetro 4x and is finally pregnant, and my other friend is a father of 2 daughters. My friends and I have decided that we will not be returning to the establishment even though the pizzas were delicious, we just don't need politics with our meals."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Robyn W.,"Houston, TX",6/20/2022,5.0,"Each trip I take to Knoxville I try a new place!  My fellow yelpers are not steering me wrong either, so thank you!  I found this place when searching for something that would be open after 8PM on a Sunday since I was driving back from Asheville. It was very easy to get to and had ample free parking! (always a bonus)  I think I got lucky since it's dinner only and getting so popular that reservations are probably best to do!It's a basic building on the outside - rectangle, solid color, nothing overtly fancy or eye catching, but once you walked inside it felt cozy and very welcoming. I loved all the details they put into making it so!  It was jam packed - every table full, but I was lucky enough to be a single dinner so got seated on the corner of the long bar on the far wall by the kitchen.  It was a great seat actually for watching all the kitchen magic happen and people watching. My server, Jake, greeted me shortly and was very nice.  Got my order in right away and made a great suggestion on the pizza since I was waffling on my decision.  He checked on me after my pate arrived and again after my pizza arrived.  Was prompt on getting me checked out all with a nice smile even though he was obviously a busy man. So onto the food & wine!  Now I'm from Houston and compare everything I eat to this cities' food scene since I can pretty much get the best of the best there. I will say this - A Dopo DID NOT disappoint me - just the opposite - bravo!!*LOVE that they had some great basic wines 'on tap'.  I got the rose (Rosato): it was a lovely soft wine on the palate with a generous pour.  I really wanted a second glass, but you know driving and all ;) *For a starter I had the mushroom pate (vegan): puree of fresh mushrooms & cashews + pickled veg + warm sourdough.  OH MY ... SO DANG GOOD!  I swear if they made a larger portion I'd have it for a meal.  That bread was by far the most delicious bread I've eaten in a long while.  So crusty with a beautifully soft interior and the flavor was outstanding.  Just writing about it again has my mouth watering.  *For the pizza I got the Jake suggested Calabrese: red sauce + House-made mozzarella + spicy salami + basil + castelvetrano olives + chili oil.  This was just fantastic as well.  The spice of the salami with chili oil melded so nicely with the salty olives and sweet basil.  It helped elevate the fresh red sauce too.  I wouldn't hesitate to get that again.  My only regret - no room for gelato!  This place is going to be book marked to return to often once I move to town!  I'll bring visitors here as well for sure!  I have found my pizza place for sho!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Caleigh J.,"TN, TN",5/23/2022,5.0,"Whether you're celebrating Valentine's Day, a graduation, out of town friends, or meeting the in-laws, A Dopo offers a boosted-casual experience and food that is sure to impress! Each pizza is uniquely crafted on top of soft sourdough crust and fired to perfection in their brick oven. The sourdough base and lightly burnt edges, along with a fantastic wine selection, make A Dopo much more than your run-of-the-mill ""pizza joint"". Don't skip the add-ons section either! It helps elevate any pizza to your liking with options from truffle oil to spicy hot. My best take: order the Soppressata with a blush base, sweet hot, and garlic! Be sure to make reservations here and venture out from your typical pizza orders. Personally, I'd skip the Margherita pizza as it pales in comparison to its more unique menu-neighbors. A Dopo is fresh, local, and suits every eater with everything from vegetarian options to classic, Mexican-bottled coke a cola."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Scarlett H.,"Columbia, SC",9/9/2022,5.0,Amazing authentic Italian pizza. You see the bags if Italian flour in bags around and the specialty hot pizza oven. The pizza is amazing with fresh delicious toppings
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Mike M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6/27/2022,5.0,Worth the Saturday wait. Delicious sourdough crust. Staff very friendly and has a nice system for wait list. Even encouraged me to walk to the brewery in corner while I await text. Got the cabrese pie (red  sauce+ House-made mozzarella + spicy salami + basil + castelvetrano olives + chili oil). Fantastic!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Andrew M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",8/13/2022,5.0,"What a spot! Local, fresh and prime ingredients crafted to perfection. This pizzeria is the real deal with domed brick oven fire up with real wood, contemporary decor and the friendly staff complete the whole experience. Also home-made Gelato is a must!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",1/7/2022,5.0,"What can I say? Do you want a good Italian style non-greasy pizza? How about outstanding house wine? And maybe great service as well? Come here!I'm a stickler for quality pizza. I've been to Italy several times, lived in New York for 10 years (not that it is the definition of good pizza) and make my own sourdough bread. The crust is thin and neutral, just like it should be. The variety of pizza is pretty wide, but not too wide that you can't make a decision. They also have new specials every day. I decided to order a margherita which is what I order at every new pizza place. It was delicious. I would prefer just a bit more mozzarella on it, and maybe a thicker layer of their homemade red sauce, but both ingredients were of high quality and incredibly delicious.I was told that mozzarella was made and house, same with the sauces.When I was in Italy I learned that each restaurant (most of them) has their own red house wine. While in the US house alcohol tends to be the cheapest and of lowest quality, in Italy they take pride in what they call a house wine. I felt similar about this place as well. The red wine was solid.Finally, the service was incredible. Our waitress checked in with us multiple times, was very attentive but not intrusive. I will absolutely be back here and would highly recommend this place to anybody."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,John M.,"Orlando, FL",1/28/2022,5.0,"A Dopo is proof that you can find good pizza anywhere. When you think of great pizza, Knoxville, Tennessee doesn't jump out at you as one of the great pizza capitals of the United States of America. However, A Dopo produces some amazing pizza.The crust is great and upon that great foundation for pizza (both figuratively and literally), they place a great sauce, quality mozzarella and an interesting selection of toppings.I grew up in New Jersey and I always just took it for granted that you could find great pizza on almost every corner. What I moved to the South overDopo twenty years ago, I was both shocked and dismayed  to discover that not only was great pizza not on every corner, it was hard to find good pizza. In fact, good pizza was found far and few between and national pizza chains (which I refer to as the fast food style of pizza) was the standard here in the South.That is why discovering a place like A Dopo is a cause to celebrate. I have to give this place five stars."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Taylor L.,"Troon Village, Scottsdale, AZ",6/25/2022,5.0,"AMAZING. My husband and I have been wanting to try A Dopo for a little bit and we are so glad we stopped in. We had some of the best pizzas we've ever had and the wait staff was super friendly. The pizza was super unique and full of flavor and came out in just a matter of minutes! We will definitely be coming back, it was a HIT!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Justin W.,"Knoxville, TN",6/16/2022,5.0,"Solid authentic pizza. Top two pizza in the city. I'll put them slightly above hard knocks. Fresh ingredients, nice crispy crust and great atmosphere. The gelato is solid as well. My favorite is the pistachio gelato!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kathy C.,"Edisto Island, SC",7/26/2022,5.0,"5 stars+++ What an awesome dinner! This pizza gem is a few minutes off of 75 or 40 and we'll worth the stop! Make a reservation. Great local beer and generous pours on the house wines! Shared the mushroom pate, which was delicious and served with pickles, etc. We had the nightly special pizza with red sauce, torn mozzarella, oregano, local jalapeños, honey, and vegan pepperoni--one of the best pizzas ever! Then we each got gelato--stracciatella, pistachio, and dark chocolate cherry--all were yummy and ample size! Our waitress was very helpful with suggestions and attentive. The decor inside is fun and eclectic! We will make this a stop whenever we are traveling thru Knoxville!!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Bao N.,"San Jose, CA",5/14/2022,1.0,"I love pizza, but this was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. I really do not understand the stellar reviews. I ordered the margherita. The dough was so damn tough & chewy my mouth was hurting. Very ordinary tomato sauce. Mozzarella overcooked and dry.I read that this was rated one of the best, so I tried it right away. This was one of the most disappointing pizzas and I'm apologize to myself daily for putting myself through that."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jeffery W.,"Arlington, VA",7/9/2022,5.0,"So very delicious!  Every pizza I've had from here has been incredible. The mushroom pizza is my favorite, but they're all killer!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Molly K.,"Knoxville, TN",5/25/2022,5.0,"Adopo is a must go! The restaurant exudes a casual and warm atmosphere, where you feel right at home sitting and scanning the extensive wine list. They offer a wide array of pizza and gelato made with the freshest ingredients. My favorite is the Sofia! Next time I'm wanting to try the trust fall for two, where your waiter picks your selections. Make sure to get a reservation before you go to ensure you can snag a table!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Theo B.,"Cedar Bluff, Knoxville, TN",7/11/2022,5.0,"My wife and I recently moved to Knoxville and we were out looking for some local pizza joints, this A Dopo fit the bill and we really enjoyed the pizza.  The staff was prompt and kind - we will definitely go back (I wish their takeout menu was a bit bigger)"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jenny B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/8/2022,5.0,I have been wanting to try this place for a while so I went to my birthday. Pizza dough was fantastic! Two things are important to me in pizza. The crust and sauce and this did not disappoint. Local brews on tap pair very well with all top quality ingredients. I recommend reservations as it is small but inviting atmosphere. Highly recommended
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jessie N.,"TN, TN",5/15/2022,5.0,As I ate my heavenly take out a Dopo pizza on my drive home some of the fresh mozzarella fell onto the floor of my dirty car; then I picked the mozzarella off the floor and ate it; it was fantastic.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rob L.,"Mendota, IL",4/11/2022,5.0,"My favorite variety of pizza is the hand-tossed thin crust Margherita style pie and when you toss a sourdough twist in there and oh yeah, have the good sense to offer you honey for dipping your crust? Then yeah, I liked A Dopo very much. I'm giving it the full five for taste. I had the Calabrese and it was a total Italian party in my mouth (phrasing)My wife may not agree as much. She had the Sofia because it's the closest thing to a traditional Midwestern sausage pizza, and none of us really realized that the fresh mozzarella was added ""after the bake"". It is listed on the menu, so there were no shennanigans  in play. And maybe you want it that way; apparently many do. But if you're like my wife, where everything on your plate must be 'piping hot', then you're not gonna like the raw cheese lumps on your pie. So if that's you, either have something else or ask if they'll put the cheese on before the bake. I would be interested in hearing if the chef's head explodes upon receiving the request.The gelato was fine, if not spectacular. The Peroni was good."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Soph And Ryan F.,"TN, TN",11/10/2021,5.0,"Overall, the pizza here is fantastic and stands out from other local pizza places. The service was attentive and the atmosphere was cozy- perfect for a date night. There is an option on the menu called the ""Trust Fall for Two"" that allows your server to choose your dinner items for you: an appetizer, two pizzas, a bottle of wine, and gelato. I would definitely suggest doing this if it is your first time eating here; it added an err of excitement to the dinner. You can tell the server your preferences beforehand so you don't receive anything you dislike/are allergic to. We got the Ovoline appetizer, which was arguably the best part of our meal. The house-made mozzarella is divine. Our pizzas were the Sofia and the Pizzicletta- the Sofia eats like a traditional pizza with some added heat from the 'nduja (spicy pork), while the Pizzicleta definitely takes some skill to get into your mouth! The Pizzicleta's flavor was actually more complex and delicious, but eating a pizza topped with a mound of loose arugula is inarguably a challenge. The bottle of wine we got was a light red blend, I don't remember the name, but we enjoyed it. It didn't particularly stand out. The gelato was half dark chocolate, and half cinnamon toast crunch- you can't really go wrong there. The gelato actually reminded me of the real stuff I've had in Italy. This place definitely deserves five stars. A adopo means ""see you later,"" and we will definitely be back!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Megan E.,"Knoxville, TN",10/11/2021,5.0,"A Dopo has an atmosphere of cool millennial meets hippie grandma. The service is friendly but not overbearing and it is just a touch above casual dining. The beer was great and for the most part the pizza was great except my boyfriend ate a rotten mushroom core on his pizza. Other than that small blip, we thoroughly enjoyed it!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Emily C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/18/2022,5.0,"Perfect place for a date night with a cozy atmosphere and delicious food and wine.  If you're feeling adventurous, trust the chef's expertise and try the pizza special (it'll be unique and it changes everyday) and of course, splurge on gelato afterwards."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Stephanie D.,"Richmond, VA",3/5/2022,5.0,"I haven't eaten in in a very long time, but getting takeout and following the advice of the menu led to me falling much more in love with this place than when I tried to pick my own food in the past. The bianca with the speck ham added and the spicy greens have been my favorites so far of the 6 pizzas I've tried. I probably won't be able to branch out from those 2 anymore because they are just so, so good! I love a place where I can just trust the advice of the staff and not have to make any decisions!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Laura M.,"Simi Valley, CA",3/25/2022,5.0,Soooooo yummy! Unique & delicious! If you're looking for a pizza that is unlike any other you've ever had...Go now.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Donald R.,"Knoxville, TN",5/21/2022,5.0,"It's hard to beat this place. My wife and I could not have had a better first impression.  We walked in, saw how crowded it was, and immediately started ordering to go, when the owner, Jessica, told us there was a cancellation.  We were seated immediately.  The place is bustling and loud on a Saturday night.  It has a mostly industrial vibe.  I like seeing the massive custom made pizza oven in the open kitchen.  Kelly, our server, was fantastic.  Despite being super busy, she stopped to explain the entire restaurant concept, the pizzas and the ingredients when we told her it was our first time here.  We took both of her suggestions (after ordering some local craft beer) for the pizza (the night's special) and a Caesar salad.  The salad had some very dark romaine and some sourdough croutons.  It also had just the right amount of dressing already mixed in.  Next, came our pizza.  It had red sauce, mozzarella, herbs and their homemade sausage. We loved the crust, which was pillow soft on the outside, and thin on the interior.  The sausage was a bit spicy, but overall the pizza was delicious.  Kelly continued checking on us.  Then, Jessica came by to see how everything was, and started a wonderful conversation about her husband (and co-owner) Brian, and the whole story about their restaurant.  She was so amazing, as we watched her expertly manage the 'Front of the house"" while Brian managed the back.  She introduced us to him as well.  We really felt we had a true dining experience and not just a meal here."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,w. W.,"TN, TN",6/13/2022,5.0,Bring you back to the old day love what they did to the place Krystals was fresh and not hard like Krystal restaurant on moreland Ave they tricking out your money and trying to blame it on Krystal
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Miriam B.,"TN, TN",6/9/2022,5.0,The people were super friendly! I did an order from their website and picked it up at the curb. The pizza itself was not for me but the ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful. I just wasn't a fan of the sourdough aspect (it's in the name though what was I expecting lol). One of the pizzas tasted a little soggy but I did have about a half-hour wait from when I got the pizzas to the time we got home and ate them. If there was a way I could give 4.5 stars I would just cause of the soggy aspect but generally not a bad experience. The inside of the restaurant seemed very welcoming and aesthetic so if you get the chance to sit down and eat there go for it!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Sheila P.,"Knoxville, TN",2/13/2022,4.0,Wow...! Read about this place in an online article about the 100 best pizza places in the country. This place was #37 and right in our backyard. (I am Celiac and I do not recommend eating here unless you are able to take a hit to the gut and charcoal after you eat!)We got the Bianca with ham and the Pepperoni pizza. Both amazing! I would've never tried a honey drizzle over pizza with garlic and four different kinds of cheese but boy oh boy does it work. The pepperoni wasn't too shabby either! I can see what they are ranked so high Topped off the meal with pistachio gelato which was equally as fantastic as the pizza. You must eat here!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Amanda W.,"Naperville, IL",7/12/2021,5.0,"Five stars for outstanding service! Eli is the definition of what good service should be and he went above and beyond to help us choose from the menu. Very nice guy. Pizza was very good, the place is pretty pricy, but worth it! Definitely slightly more dressy. We happened to stumble upon it and loved the ambiance. We dubbed it ""Trendy pizza"".Perfect for a date night! Bad neighborhood though, don't hang around after dark."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Angela G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/30/2022,5.0,"Seriously the best pizza you could get in Knoxville! I was looking for a great pizza place after moving here from Chicago, and this place is it. It has a great variety and it you're feeling like a culinary adventure, get the Chefs Choice for Two and you won't be disappointed."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Loretta L.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2022,4.0,Sourdough pizza crust with gourmet toppings. Not kid friendly. They offer amazing sorbet for dessert
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dani P.,"Charlotte, NC",5/14/2021,5.0,"Calling all visitors - this is a ""MUST eat here"" place!!! This spot came as a recommendation and I thank the pizza gods and Xul Bartender for sending me here. For an experience to be ""amazing"" it needs to go well from start to finish. Claps to A Dopo for accomplishing just that. The hostess was incredibly sweet and patient. I wasn't expecting it to be so lovely and full service so I probably looked like a dazed and confused customer. She was very kind and walked me to my seat on the wall. Eli was my server and greeted my promptly. I could tell he was increasingly busy as the night picked up pace but he still maintained excellent service. I was only coming in for a pizza. He made fantastic suggestions and guided me through the menu so eloquently that I ended up ordering an app, pizza, a beverage, and dessert. Whoops. Oh well I'm on vacation. The app, recommended by Eli, was absolutely delicious. I'm Italian and it's hard to find good bread, good mozz, and good pesto/olive oil. How did A Dopo manage to pull off all of them and blow my expectations of out the water?! I'm trying not to fill up on the app and practiced will power. Eli noticed and quickly got me a Togo box for my appetizer, wonderful gesture.I got my pizza and wow. I'm not kidding this is literally the best pizza I have ever eaten. My tastebuds were having a dance party in my mouth. I was watching the owner create pizzas in their exposed kitchen area, which was incredibly clean! Love to see it. The owner was absolutely killing it and enjoying every moment. The owner sets the tone for the restaurant so it was easy to spot him in the crew. He even boxed up my pizza for me! Eli asked if I wanted dessert. How could I say no? I'm going to sound crazy but, go figure, it was the best gelato I've ever had. I don't have a picture of it because I devoured it. Pistachio gelato will forever be my fav. A Dopo - please open up in Charlotte, NC or Charleston, SC! I miss you already. If I'm ever back in Knoxville you will be seeing me. Thanks for setting the bar extra high."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Anna L.,"Knoxville, TN",12/21/2021,5.0,"Absolutely YES! Grab whatever the special pizza is and a glass of sparkling water and house red. I am so glad they exist - carry out is always fast and friendly, even if you aren't eating inside yet due to Covid.You won't be disappointed here, and I am very picky about my pizza!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Robert W.,"TN, TN",6/26/2022,5.0,Really nice wait staff. Really Good food.  Prices are reasonable. I liked the atmosphere. You need reservations. I would recommend people try it at least once. The food may not be to everyone's liking but i thought it was delicious and a good place to enjoy a meal with friends
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Julie B.,"San Diego, CA",4/22/2022,5.0,"This place had a nice ambiance and delicious food.  We appreciated the vegan options, and the prices were great for the quality.  Our server was very kind and friendly.  We would visit again!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ashley W.,"Knoxville, TN",4/23/2022,5.0,My favorite pizza downtown! Everyone is so nice and the food is incredible! Super fresh ingredients
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Christine C.,"Westfield, IN",4/10/2021,5.0,"This is, hands down, the best pizza I have ever had.  Everything about our night at A Dopo was perfect. Our server, Amanda, was absolutely lovely and perfectly charming. She was very helpful in guiding this group of first timers through our meal. Service, in general, was great and we were really impressed with their Covid precautions and what they asked of us as we were seated to help keep everyone safe. I wish more restaurants took the time to do that. We started with the Insalata and Ovaline. Both were wonderfully fresh and light. My family of four ordered four different pizzas. I had the Pizzicletta and I'd honestly have a hard time ordering anything but the Pizzicletta next time. It was that good. We finished our meal with their homemade gelato, and it was outstanding.We left with very full bellies and a wish that the good folks at A Dopo would open up an Indianapolis location, as we're heading home tomorrow. We'll be back next time we pass through!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Justin C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/10/2022,5.0,"This is the best pizza I've ever had. The red sauce is amazing and full of flavor. You'll need reservations if you want to eat in and you'll want to plan at least a week in advance to get the time slots you want on the weekend. It's pricey but worth it. Save room for the gelato. Flavors rotate and we've tried salted caramel, chocolate, and another I can't pronounce (or spell) that essentially cookies and cream."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Katie S.,"Maryville, TN",4/9/2022,5.0,Wow!! First time having sourdough pizza and loved it!! We actually did the trust fall and absolutely savored every bite!! Delicious!! Highly recommend!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Katie D.,"Lexington, KY",6/27/2022,5.0,"We will definitely be adding this place to our dinner rotation! Great staff, phenomenal pizzas, and great beer selection!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ben W.,"Knoxville, TN",9/25/2020,5.0,Best pizza in Knoxville!!!  Hip downtown location on Williams street near the old city. The interior has an industrial vibe and is always filled with the cool crowd. Be sure to make reservations in advance.The owners are wonderful people and very talented. A Dopo is all about fresh ingredients and it shows in the food quality. Pick any pizza and you will be impressed! Save room for the homemade gelato.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Macy D.,"TN, TN",9/7/2021,5.0,"I would give A Dopo ten out of five stars if I could. This place never disappoints. It's one of my favorite places to go for a date or a birthday dinner- and this trip was for my boyfriend's birthday. It's a higher end pizza place for sure, but the quality is reflected in the price (and worth every cent!). We started by splitting the pesto appetizer with fresh mozzarella. YUM. It was delicious and perfect for two people to share. He and I each got our own pizzas, and we both had enough to take home and have for another meal. I got the funghi even though I'm not a mushroom fan- and subbed out the mushrooms for fresh mozzarella. I've been to A Dopo many times, but I think this is my favorite combo I've ever tried! SO cheesy and the perfect amount of garlic. So yummy. My boyfriend gets the Sopressata every time, it's his favorite. He adds the sweet hot drizzle which he swears by. We always split a carafe of one of the house wines (we love the red!), and also try a couple gelatos for dessert. The flavors are interesting and you can split half and half as an option too. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for wonderful pizza in Knoxville!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Stefan M.,"TN, TN",6/22/2022,4.0,We had the best service and good pizza.  We order the Nduja & Mushrooms and Calabriese.  They were both very good.  We will definitely return very soon to try other pies on the menu.  Hopefully we can get Vahid and whoever was training him that day. They were awesome
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Lisa E.,"Newark, DE",8/30/2021,5.0,"So great! We got the special white pizza with marzipan and ricotta, and a prosciutto type ham. Delicious! Got the ""sweet hot peppers"" on the side- honey and hot peppers in a relish type texture. Hot but really cool! Margarita pizza was very good too! Topped it off with homemade gelato- awesome! Our server Minka (?) was wonderful and very accommodating. Definitely be back when we're that way"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dustin E.,"Evansville, IN",6/18/2022,5.0,"Great service, great pizza, and an amazing makes this pizza place a must stop. I hope I'm back in Knoxville again, and can stop back by!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Alex S.,"San Jose, CA",3/10/2022,5.0,"My favorite pizza place in Knoxville. Quality ingredients and an amazing product. Their breads and crust are delicious. I love that their bianca pizza has a tiny bit of a honey drizzle.  Never seen that before anywhere else, but it works so well. Very nice servers. I've tried one of their salads, and found the dressing a bit too acidic. Otherwise they can do no wrong. Delicious pizzas, wonderful bread and appetizers. Bomb gelato."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Scott M.,"Knoxville, TN",5/22/2020,4.0,"Great local, artisan pizza place! A Dopo is great, but that is one of its biggest drawbacks. They are so great that you need to show up 30-40mins before they open to get a table. When I went with my wife, Yelp reviews had already warned us to show up early. When they run out of dough, that's when dinner service ends.  The pizzas are made with the finest quality of ingredients and are based on traditional Italian recipes. They are expensive, but seem to be justified by the product quality. Eating hear is an experience, so that is one thing that helps account for their premium prices."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Mandy J.,"Destin, FL",6/14/2022,5.0,Everything about this place was awesome! I had a group of women join me for my birthday and they all loved it as well! The pizza was delicious and fresh!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Daniel C.,"Dallas, TX",1/7/2021,5.0,"An absolutely standout experience. Easily one of the top pizzas I've had in my life (the wife agrees) - this includes personal favorites in Italy and NYC. We tried both a red and white, and they were both excellent.Worth traveling back to Knoxville just for a visit to A Dopo, since I have been dreaming about it ever since. For a place this good, it is even more shocking to find such a gem in one the more unassuming of places in the world."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Diane W.,"Lebanon, OR",6/6/2022,5.0,Great food! Had the pistachio pesto appetizer and it was amazing!!! The pizza also very good. Didnt know we needed reservations but they were kind enough to make room for us.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kendall R.,"Hillwood, Nashville, TN",1/7/2021,5.0,"This pizza is so unique, I hesitate to categorize it as pizza. It's so artisanal, it seems like a very distant cousin of your regular pizza. I've been here a handful of times and the white sauce and red sauce pizzas are equally delicious. This time I ordered online and did curbside pickup and I was so impressed by how quick they were! I had literally just pulled up and someone ran out to ask my name and brought out my pizza less than 30 seconds later. Even at room temperature by the time we got to eat it, it was still so amazing."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ryan M.,"Midlothian, VA",5/27/2022,5.0,Wow pizza was so good and the atmosphere was very cozy and welcoming made me want to stay longer !! homemade Gelato is on point had the Fruity pebble one!!!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Gabe L.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",2/26/2022,4.0,"The restaurant experience itself is a nice change up. You sit in a dim light room by candle light at your table and it's very calming. The pizza itself was good, but not the best I've had in Knoxville. Definitely a restaurant worth at least trying for sure though!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Bailey T.,"Maryville, TN",2/20/2022,5.0,Amazing atmosphere. You can taste the freshness in every bite! If you are adventurous try the trust fall! They pick 3 courses for you and you get a bottle of wine! My favorite restaurant in Knoxville!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Bailey T.,"Maryville, TN",12/18/2021,5.0,"Amazing. Love the trust fall. They pick a bottle of wine, app, 2 pizzas and gelato. Always has a delicious and interesting special pizza. My go to spot for pizza."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Bailey T.,"Maryville, TN",2/14/2021,5.0,"Had an amazing experience. Did the trust fall for 2 which they pick a bottle of wine, an app, 2 pizzas and a gelato! Loved not knowing what was coming next. Always a great experience and delicious and fresh food."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Susan B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/12/2021,5.0,"Not your run of the mill pizza place! A Dopo Sourdough Pizza was amazing! My daughter ordered, so don't know the names of the pizzas, but they were nothing short of superb! I'm telling you, every time I took a bite of pizza, I made this sound of pure pleasure, the pizza was that good! I'm serious, it is no exaggeration! The service was outstanding. Yes, a pizza joint with outstanding service! Who would have guessed! A Dopo is actually not a pizza joint. It's several levels above that! The atmosphere of the restaurant is cool, hip, welcoming to everyone! Last night I was cool and hip! I kind of liked it! I highly recommend A Dopo Sourdough Pizza!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Audrey K.,"Knoxville, TN",2/12/2022,5.0,"Went for a girls pizza night, and boy was it perfect! We ordered two pizzas, a focaccia bread appetizer, and finished off with gelato. It was all delicious! The crust was crispy and thin and the sauce was amazing. The sopressata pizza was so tasty, as well as the margarita pizza. We added hand torn mozzarella and it was divine. Very good service and a cool urban atmosphere. We left full and happy. Definitely recommend reservations"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kassi S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/29/2022,4.0,"This is very good, don't let the odd location fool you, the pizza is quite nice. As is the bread. I know they are trying to keep it simple but I would love a few salad options. I am the type that loves a good salad with my dinner almost no matter what I'm having but other then that I really enjoyed it. And we sampled their gelato and it was yummy! Also it's a good idea to make a reservation"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Robin B.,"Nashville, TN",7/7/2021,5.0,"When the smell of wood fired pizza smothers you in a warm embrace upon entering, you know you're in the right place. We stopped in on a Tuesday night and got a seat at the long counter against one wall, close enough to watch the magic going on in the open air kitchen. The beautifully tiled pizza oven had a constant rotation of pizzas going in and coming out all with that slight char that makes your mouth water. We started with the mushroom paté appetizer which was accompanied by warm sourdough bread and house made pickled onions and cucumbers. A very tasty way to start our meal. Next we shared the special pizza of the night which had zucchini, onions, chili oil and shaved cheeses with fresh parsley on top. I appreciate that they have sparkling water along with still, always feels like I'm in Italy when that's an option. A Dopo was recommended to us by a local brewery as the best pizza, and they weren't lying!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Lacey K.,"Lompoc, CA",4/22/2022,5.0,"Best pizza in Knoxville! Not only is their food delicious, but their service is awesome as well. We're yet to dine in here (would be super cute for a date night though)- since we moved to Knoxville during the pandemic we pretty much only do takeout. A few weeks ago I was late picking up my order (my own fault), and the staff made me a new pizza free of charge. They really wanted to make sure our food was hot, which was very kind and certainly not their responsibility at all since it was my bad for being late. I should also add that I don't normally like sourdough anything, but their crust is delicious. Definitely give them a try!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Alaina Z.,"Iowa City, IA",12/24/2021,5.0,Great pizza and such a cozy feel inside. Super friendly and amazing pizza. We've been coming here for years every time we come into town and it's always so delicious. I had the kale pizza with white truffle oil and it was incredible. Yummy!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ceri F.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2020,5.0,"Ordered a margarita pizza. Red sauce, House made mozzarella, basil and olive oil. It is amazing and delicious in it's simplicity. The subtle flavor of sour in the sourdough crust and the toothsome was awesome! It is definitely worth the trip downtown.We also ordered a white pie. The Pizzicletta pizza. This is top with white sauce, a 16 month age prosciutto and then topped with arugula dressed with lemon juice and olive oil pizza it was wonderful. The pepperiness of the arugula paired well with the zip of the lemon juice. Was fantastic with a creamy white sauce and prosciutto.Even though we were all full, we could not pass on the gelato. We each got a flavor so that we could try a little of each. We ordered Stracciatella, Pistachio and dark chocolate gelato. The Stracciatella is very much like a vanilla ice cream with shaved chocolate mixed. The dark chocolate gelato was luscious. Thick rich and ever so slightly sweetened. Our favorite was the one recommended by our waiter, the pistachio. This is not one that we would normally have ordered on our own. But I tell you what it was the best of the three ice cream's!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Andrea C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/15/2021,3.0,"The bones are good. I like the location, the menu, the atmosphere. Our focaccia and part of our pizza crust was burnt beyond enjoyment. The char is welcome and expected but it was beyond. The server took some of my food before I had finished. As a seasoned server I also hate being served my check with dessert. Just give us a moment to enjoy dessert. We didn't like one of the gelatos but the other was delicious. We were never asked as we were paid out by the time we enjoyed it."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Michelle R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/14/2020,5.0,"What's there to say that already hasn't been said? A Dopo is excellent and a true gem in Knoxville. I recently brought my parents here when they were in town for my wedding. As New Jerseyans who literally eat pizza twice a week, they have strong pizza opinions -- and they were extremely impressed. From the appetizers to the dessert, you're in store for a multi-course meal that is A+ all around. And if you're vegetarian, there are way more options than just a plain cheese pie to keep you happy -- although, I do highly recommend the marghertia because it is actually really good, hah.Also, after learning it was my wedding weekend, the hostess treated us to prosecco on the house which was so unexpected and such a sweet gesture."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Julia L.,"Knoxville, TN",12/29/2021,5.0,Best pizza ever. Great ingredients and the best herbs. You won't want any other pizza
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Tyler H.,"TN, TN",1/1/2022,5.0,First and foremost I have to save that I loved the location of this place. The service was really great. The food was amazing. I could honestly say that I had zero complaints for this restaurant. The price point was super accurate for the service/food! My wife and I will definitely be returning here!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kevin L.,"Boring, OR",4/29/2022,5.0,"Wonderful hand made pizzas and incredible service.  The wine list is extensive, with many top notch bottles to choose from.   Make a reservation, this place is deservedly popular."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Breia M.,"Atlanta, GA",5/29/2021,5.0,"We were in town and pick this up on the way to the hotel, and it did not disappoint. When we called in our order the lady was extremely helpful and oh so kind when she brought our pizza out to us. We got the mushroom pizza and thin mint gelato. Do not miss out of this gelato because it is the best I've had!"

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Emma F.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",5/31/2021,5.0,"Everything was amazing. The starters (sourdough, mushroom pate, and olive oil), the pizza, the wine, the gelato, the service! All spectacular. Would definitely recommend."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jasmine N.,"Memphis, TN",10/7/2019,5.0,"This is arguably the best pizza place in Knoxville. I came here on a Thursday night with one other person and ordered the Margherita. Loved it so much that we came back with a large group of friends the next day. The crust was beautifully charred with the taste of the sourdough shining through. The tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil were perfectly balanced and it's honestly the best combination you could get on a pizza. of all the types of pizza you could get here, I will 100% recommend the margherita pizza.I also had the pizzicletta pizza in which the arugula was all over the place and didn't really belong on the pizza while the lemon was overpowering. The aged prosciutto and olive oil was the only thing good about the pizza - but I can't give it high marks due to the high price. My friend had the spicy greens pizza in which the kale was salty and lemon was overpowering. The chilis was a nice touch and the crust was delicious. Service was bad for the first time I came here but was very accommodating for our large group. The first I came here, our water was empty for 20 minutes straight and we waited so long (10+ min) for the waiter to come for the credit card to charge our check that we decided to just leave cash and left the restaurant. Service is usually very important to me but the taste of the pizza made up for it."

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jeff R.,"Moon, PA",11/18/2021,5.0,"People, this is not trendy, hipster or unique pizza, this is what pizza is supposed to taste like.   I moved here from S. Cali and really missed high quality ingredients and this place is getting it right.  Hopefully you guys can open more locations:)"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Douglas P.,"New Market, TN",10/16/2020,5.0,Plate smelled like pottery is the only complaint. Friendly staff. Took good care of us and guided us to two great pizzas  very Covid conscience one white pizza and one red. The wife and daughter thought the white pizza was best when I  know the red was the best.  The building has been repurposed unique sound baffles.  Place looked clean extremely. But mostly food was wonderful Staff gave a taste of gelato It's a go.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Paul H.,"Knoxville, TN",4/15/2021,5.0,"I went to a working meeting here.  I have been eating a keto diet for the last two years. So I didn't think there would be anything that I could eat here. After I ask the waitress about my options, she said the chef could make a charcuterie board for me. It was absolutely the best charcuterie board that I have ever had at a restaurant!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rich R.,"TX, TX",9/21/2019,5.0,"Good pizza in the middle of the USA??? Finding this place was like finding the prize in the cereal box or a night of incredible S.......hugging.......Since I was lone wolfing it, I was placed at a large table with some of Knoxville's finest women. I had the pepperoni special pizza and a few beers. The ladies(on date night) had the mozzarella appetizer. Both were amazing and we decided to share. Cooked so well, perfect crust, cooked perfectly.I will be back...gelato is calling my name."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Sarah C.,"Hermitage, TN",9/4/2021,5.0,"If you want to experience pizza akin to what you would get in Italy- this is your place. I've been here 3 or 4 times (I live 4hours away) and every time it's SO delicious. I've been to Italy and own a Forza Forni pizza oven, so I know what's the real deal and this is it. The sourdough is well balanced with a slight tang that adds depth to the flavor. This is the BEST you'll get aside from going to Italy!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,A L.,"Culver City, CA",10/4/2021,5.0,"Super delicious pizza. Amazing crust. Bright and tangy red sauce that tastes super fresh (not sweet, if you like sweet sauce). Cheese placement was great."

Get the mozzarella and focaccia bread to start, pizza and then finish up with gelato!  Yum yum yum!!!"

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Amber L.,"Knoxville, TN",3/15/2022,5.0,This was our first time visiting and it was a wonderful experience. Great food and gelato and our server was fantastic! We can't wait to come back!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Monica C.,"Knoxville, TN",7/27/2021,5.0,"This is the SPOT! cool ambiance. We ordered the mozzarella pesto and focaccia and it was so fresh and fantastic. I ordered the last bianca pizza on the menu with prosciutto and arugula with a hint of lemon and oil. Since they offer white truffle oil and anything truffle oil rules, I opted for that and it was just the most perfect pizza! Fresh, quality ingredients. I could have easily split this pizza with my husband. He had the spicy salami pizza and that was yummy too but it had nothing on mine. We had some gelato too and it was yummy. I'm excited to go again."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Anna J.,"San Francisco, CA",7/20/2021,4.0,"My favorite pizza place in town. The pizza is amazing. Post COVID, the service has been a little off. Still, giving four stars because of the food and in hopes the service turns around again. The last time I was there our small party of four had reservations and were seated pretty soon after we arrived, but it took over an hour to receive our food. It was busy and it would have been fine, but our water and wine glasses sat empty most of the time too."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Atlee M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/7/2020,5.0,"Looking for love? Look no further, because you will fall in love with A Dopo. It is magical little spot.  Typically, it is very busy, so be prepared to wait. If it is a nice night, your kids can play in the grass area out front. I like the rank places by taste, atmosphere, and how I feel after. So here are those rankings:Taste: fresh, bright, bold, sweet, hot and everything else. We ordered three different pizzas; two white sauce based and one red sauce based. The texture of the sourdough bread was perfect. No spot was to tough and it was evenly cooked all the way through. I highly encourage you to order one with meats and one with the lighter veggies, like arugula. Don't leave without trying a gelato! Atmosphere: Simple, yet profoundly romantic. The lighting is lower enhanced by candles at every table. The pizza prep area is open so you can watch the giant stone oven. The windows all the way across the front bring so much natural light in. One wall is covered in logos of other local places in town and that is a joy to look at and chat about so many mother places. How I feel after: dreaming about going back and trying every thing on the menu. While I don't eat pizza often, the whole experience left me feeling like I had escaped from real life for the most enjoyable night with fresh food and friends. Just my the heart needs!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Justin M.,"Lafayette-Winona, Norfolk, VA",2/12/2022,5.0,Great pizza. Italian furnace with wonderful sourdough bread. The atmosphere is very nice and the drink selection was fantastic. I'd recommend to anyone looking for pizza in Knoxville.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Matt C.,"Maryville, TN",1/13/2020,5.0,"Tucked away, like the gem it is but you cant call it hidden because the doors are flying off this place from open to close! Brick oven, sourdough pizza in a traditional Italian style is what they serve up at A dopo. They pair up with local breweries and vintars to and they serve up fresh made gelato to top it off and round out the experience. They sell out every night, they require reservations or plan to wait. A dopo is so worth what ever it takes you to get a table and when your done your return visit cant come quick eneugh.If A dopo has stayed hidden from you, find it!! Dont tell em I sent you because they wpmt know who the hell I am but i know you'll love it."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Leena N.,"Seattle, WA",12/20/2019,5.0,"I'm a girl who really loves exceptional pizza, so I used Yelp to locate A Dopo Sourdough Pizza and I was NOT disappointed!  While I went in with more than a bit of skepticism, by the end of my first meal here I was a card carry fan :-)Tip: The restaurant is open for dinner only. They take reservations only for parties of six or more, so if your party is smaller than that and you're planning to visit on a weekend I suggest you go early to minimize your wait time.In Italian, the phrase ""A dopo"" means ""See you later"".  Given the exceptional quality of the sourdough pies they make here, they can certainly count on me taking their name literally - it's already a foregone conclusion that I'll become a regular :-)The sourdough pies are baked in a 900 degree oven, which requires just under 80 seconds for each one to cook.  The toppings are obviously fresh and top-quality, and the mozzarella used for the pies is house-made; it's soft, chewy, and melts beautifully on the pizza.I've tried different pies on each of my visits here, and so far my favorites are ""The Pizzicletta"" (white sauce with 16 month aged prosciutto, arugula, lemon, and olive oil) and ""The Calabrese"" (red sauce with house-made mozzarella, spice salami, basil, castevetrano olives, and chili oil).  You really can't go wrong with any pie you pick, and I look forward to sampling many more.Tip: Adopo not only serves amazing pies, but they offer house-made gelato and a surprisingly wide selection of Italian wine :-)Bottom line: If you're tired of greasy, mass-produced, sub-quality pizza you owe it to yourself to pay this place a visit - you won't be sorry!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Carly G.,"Brookline, MA",7/7/2021,5.0,"Extremely good, trendy pizza. One pizza is enough for one person. It does get very crowded early, so if you can't get a reservation you can take your food to-go and bring it to one of the nearby local breweries. I got a prosciutto & arugula pizza and it was one of the best I've had."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Sean F.,"Knoxville, TN",12/18/2019,5.0,"Where to start, well obviously with the gelato right? Tried 3 of them with my wife and daughter. I had the chocolate chip (not even going to try to type the actual name, it's Italian), my wife got the pistachio, and my daughter got the dark chocolate. All 3 are fantastic, but I have to say the pistachio was my favorite, which worked out as the chocolate chip was my wife's and we were able to swap. The pizza is to die for, that sourdough crust is divine and all the flavors are delicate and delicious. My personal favorite was the margarita, it is so simple and clean. We also got the one with arugula and prosciutto and it was surprisingly delightful. Usually arugula tends to be peppery and overwhelming but it was cut by lemon juice and really tempered the flavors.We also ordered a pizza with some sort of spicy sausage, it was a little hot for me but tasted really good.BTW the pizza rehears nicely in the oven! Bonus."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,AshleyMarie O.,"Pensacola, FL",10/10/2019,5.0,"Oh. MY. GAWD. OMG - you guys... this place NEEDDDSSSS to come to Miami. I am obsessed. Every time I've visited Knoxville my sister has mentioned going here but we never made the trip until my most recent visit. And then we made sure to go twice as WOW this pizza is obsessive. SO GOOD, SO YUM. I could eat it everyday and then my life would be complete. If you are nearby GO!!! You will not have a single regret. If you are far away, come visit lol!!!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Blake W.,"Old City, Knoxville, TN",2/2/2020,5.0,"WHEN THE MOON HITS YOUR EYE LIKE A BIG PIZZA PIE THATS - A Dopo! An incredible pay-day pizza spot! We waited an hour and a half  (rookie-move,  because pro tip: they have a waiting list you can join on their website) but it was worth every minute. It's obvious their ingredients are top-notch quality, something you could taste in every bite. If you like spicy anything, I highly recommend adding the Calabrian peppers to your pizza!While the food was tasty, the service made for a really great experience. When we checked  in, the host recommended a  place nearby to  have a drink while we  waited for a table. When we came back, they offered us drinks since our table wasn't quite ready yet. With a packed house, it was surprising to get this level of attention. We'll be back!"

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Claire H.,"Downtown Memphis, Memphis, TN",6/28/2021,5.0,Best pizza in Knoxville by far. Definitely pizza that is more on the fancy side so if you don't like that this place is not for you. The margarita pizza is excellent and also good when ordered togo.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rick M.,"San Marino, CA",5/9/2021,5.0,"Dopo Sourdough Pizza is not to be missed!  The sourdough crust was crispy with a chewy center.  The toppings were great, especially the white pizza!  I am glad we found this place on our latest visit.  It will be first on the list when we return to Knoxville!  Pizza lovers should give this pie a try!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Michael B.,"TN, TN",6/24/2021,5.0,"We were driving through fromChicago and stopped here. After a week of finding spots to eat on our drive, this one far outshined every other meal. The local, smoked yellow tomato sauce was genius, and the blueberry/almond panna cotta was amazing. As if the the food weren't great enough, the staff were THE best. They treated us like we were dear friends stopping by for dinner. We had a small problem with our appetizer that I only mention in order to praise their handling of it--they didn't just humbly and profusely apologize and comp it; the chef came to the table to bring us his favorite. Again, it was like they were genuinely looking after people for whom they cared. I cannot say enough good about this place. It's only ""flaw"" is being so far from my home in North Carolina...but that might be better fir my waistline, because I would want to eat here all the time."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Maggie H.,"Pensacola, FL",12/16/2021,5.0,A Dopo may be my new favorite restaurant in Knoxville. The Pizzicleta pizza is hands down the best pizza I have ever had!!! Looking forward to the next time I can go!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Annie M.,"Cleveland, OH",4/26/2018,5.0,"I'm going to say something completely contraversial and shocking but....the pizza with NO cheese was the highlight of my dining experience here!  I know, crazy, right?I had an extremely satisfying and enjoyable experience here at A Dopo and if I lived in Knoxville, this would definitely be a staple in my diet.  The space is beautiful, decorated in a minimalist style, and feels very clean.  Every part of my experience here was great, from the service, the appetizer and meal, the wine, and even the very clean bathrooms.  I dined here on a Saturday night with a group of 5 and after a short wait we were seated at a community table (love these!) and immediately given excellent care by our server.  We all shared two caraffes of wine (one red and one white).  They were easy to drink and very tasty.  We also split the salad of the day, a hearty, heart happy salad with collard greens, lentils and other roasted veggies.  The salad was very fresh and delicious.  For our main course, we split three pizzas, which ended up being the perfect amount.  I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed each pizza but the plain pizza with no cheese and a chili oil drizzle was beyond good.  Holy wow, I've been dreaming about this pizza ever since.  The sourdough crust is thin and soft and the sauce is sweet and flavorful.Seriously, I want that pizza in my mouth again.  I hope to be back to Knoxville soon and will definitely be here again!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Nash B.,"Knoxville, TN",6/15/2021,5.0,Probably some of the best pizza in Knoxville! Tasty sauce and amazing crust. The gelato was excellent as well.

Triple A+ from me and I will be back often."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",8/9/2021,5.0,"I came here with a friend on a Sunday, but I had called ahead to make a reservation for late afternoon. We were seated promptly upon arrival, so the reservation was honored, thankfully. The building of the restaurant itself seems to have been a converted industrial building, albeit not a giant warehouse. There wasn't any type of waiting area outside of the restaurant and the restaurant doesn't have that built into the floor design either. I'm mentioning this since other reviewers have mentioned long wait times. Unless patrons were just standing outside the whole time as they waited, the only other option might be waiting in one's car, but I can't confirm either. The interior of the restaurant is fairly minimalistic. Concrete floors, albeit with some type of epoxy coating. It wasn't anything ugly, just apparent that it wasn't designed to be visually appealing or be anything more than just utilitarian. Service was excellent. We had water and menus nearly right away by our server Bridgette. For an appetizer, my friend and I ordered some bread with sliced burrata. It was clearly apparent that their bread was not something off the shelf, but a sourdough that was made in-house. I enjoyed it. For pizzas: I ordered the special of the day, which was marinara sauce, garlic slices, and pepperoni on 12"" pie. My friend had the 12"" mushrooms on white sauce. There were char marks on the crust and leoparding on the bottom, but unlike the experience of other reviewers,  neither my friend nor I considered the pizzas to be burnt. On the contrary, the pizzas matched my expectations of pizzas made in a wood fired oven. When we finished our meals, I was able to get our check right away, pay it, and then be on our way. Some places, for whatever sad reason, seem to become inattentive when the customer is asking to pay his check or is kept waiting and waiting as they run his card or get him back his change. No such experience for us. The place also has a wine selection to pair with your meal, but neither my friend nor I had wine so I can't speak to that. This is not a place that I think children would like, nor a place if you just want a Dominos or Papa Johns type of pizza. Nothing against Dominos nor Papa Johns, but they are trying to cater to a different audience. A Dopo is more if you want the wood-fired oven taste and want to try the offerings of the chef, which are not going to be the standard New York pepperoni slice."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Wesley L.,"TN, TN",4/9/2021,5.0,"Our experience at A Dopo was fantastic! First, we had attempted to set a reservation through Resy (on Google). But it wasn't clear if our reservation had gone through.  When we showed up shortly before our reservation time, they couldn't find us on the reservation list. However, they let us know that some other folk cancelled their reservation and they managed to squeeze us in at a table. From the minute we entered the restaurant, they were friendly and helpful. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great. It felt like a mix between nice, but laid back and non-formal - like a great place for a date. Once seated, we were a bit overwhelmed by the menu (very non-traditional as far as pizza names and toppings go), but our hostess was incredibly helpful walking us through the menu.We ended up ordering two pizzas: margherita (red sauce based) and 'nduja & mushrooms (white sauce based). Both pizzas were delicious, but I give a slight edge to the white sauce pizza, personally. The pizzas are personal size (12-13""), but we were comfortably able to split two pizzas between three people. If everyone is very hungry, I recommend getting one per person.For dessert, we decided to try some of their house-made gelato. Their salted caramel gelato was the most amazing gelato I've ever had in the States. I definitely recommend leaving room for their gelato at the end of the meal."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Diana G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/2/2019,5.0,"They get it right every time! I've been here many of times in the past few years. Pizza is always amazing and so different from anywhere else, you can always add on or take away as you please.  Wine selection is cleverly selected to go with the food. Servers are knowledgeable and attentive. Only thing I would recommenced, is to put yourself on the waiting list before heading down their. They are always busy on the weekend. And if you do have to wait, just got to Public House and grab a drink. It's worth the wait. The pizza makes up for it."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Erika M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/25/2017,5.0,"I love, love, love A Dopo.  It just gets me.  It understands my needs and never lets me down.  The staff is ridiculously nice and they know the menu well.  They are able to offer suggestions and recommendation, and have yet to steer me wrong.  I'm pretty sure that's because there's nothing on the menu that I don't love.  The owner has worked very hard to create a community inclusive restaurant and that gets me every time.  He loves his community and it's important to him to serve a product that he is proud of, and it shows.  The food is phenomenal.  I love the sourdough crust.  And I love that they allow that to be the star of the show, rather than hiding it a mounds of sauce and toppings.  I am always blown away by their salads.  Before I walk in the door, I always know that I'll be ordering whatever salad they have listed on their features menu.  My favorite pizza is their spicy greens.  It's a rich white pizza with the perfect amount of spice, acidity, and freshness.  Please, if I'm dying, bring me this pizza.  And no meal here is complete without ordering gelato.  It's perfection.  This place is as legit as they come.  Oh, and they use Nowait so you can get on the list before you even get there.  #supercool"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",1/31/2020,5.0,"Bathroom: two clean single occupancy Baby changing table: noThere is just something so special about these sourdough pizzas coming out of the wood burning oven. My favorite go-to pizza is the soppresata that I do not share with anyone else at the table. It has the right about of spiciness from the meat that makes this pizza option on point. You may think that this is not a big deal but to me it is everything: sparkling water on tap. Let me tell you, I can drink a fortune of sparkling water. A great appetizer to share amongst the table is the ovoline--house made mozzarella with pesto and sourdough bread. If you are a fan of olives, get a side of the castelvetrano olives and have them warm it for you. Let me warn you, this side order can be pricey. If they fix it up real nice with garlic and olive oil than that can cost you up to $9. However, ask for it plain jane and it'll run you a few dollars. Their house made gelato is always rotating and the pistachio flavor is to die for. Nothing artificial and everything is so real with plenty of nuts.Pro tip: add yourself to the waitlist which can be found when you search the business on google."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Michele M.,"El Dorado, CA",9/21/2021,5.0,Great sourdough pizza! I always like to try the margherita when dining at a new place. This one was perfect. Nice char on the crust. Perfect amount of sauce and fresh mozzarella. Yum!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Bruce K.,"Norcross, GA",6/6/2017,4.0,"Sourdough Pizza... Sourdough? Whoever has heard of that before? We came on Cinco de Mayo, and knowing that probably half of the population of Knoxville was out drinking margaritas at Mexican restaurants I had a feeling that there wasn't going to be such a busy crowd. So, as a fellow yelper invited the GF and I out to join her on the festivities, we obliged.What did we order...We got the ""nduja and mushrooms with added pepperoni. Let's just say it was an interesting pizza. The pizza is pretty thin crust, along with a good amount of bubbles within the bread crusted with toasted edges from cooking in the wood fired oven. I've been watching a lot of pizza videos on youtube, and what I learned was that I am in no way an expert at pizzas. For dessert we had to check out their gelato. The GF ordered the pistachio gelato. That was a winner. Whole pistachio hidden inside the gelato, you know that it's legit."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kleopatra G.,"Nashville, TN",2/15/2020,4.0,"This place is a breathe of fresh air for Knoxvillians who love pizza. Actually, for bougie Knoxvillians who love artisan pizzas. I felt like I was back in Nashville. The pizza is delicious, I only have one complaint. Not enough basil on the Margherita pizza. The pizza only has like 4 ingredients so you can't skimp on any of them. The house wine is also very good and affordable. The wait wasn't too bad for a Saturday night, I think this place likes to appear more busy than they really are. I will definitely be back for a wine and pizza night."

It was my first time having wood-fired pizza and it was delicious! The dough is so soft. The pizza here tastes fresh and the toppings are unique. Each pizza is about 13 inches, so my parents and I ordered two pizzas and we had plenty to eat. We didn't order dessert, but I've heard they have excellent gelato as well. Hopefully I can order some next time! They have done a lot with this part of town and there are so many new restaurants opening around here that I'm looking forward to trying! If you haven't tried this place yet I highly recommend it. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is very comfortable. I will definitely be coming back!"

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Holly S.,"Stuart, FL",7/9/2021,3.0,"I really wanted to like this pizza.  It was highly recommended.  The starter was fantastic .  Simple and delicious.  I would go back for it but not for the pizza.  The pizza was meh.  The crust had a great dog bone but where the topping were was too thin but not thin enough to be crispy so it was just floppy and yuck.  The topping were fresh and great but sparse   I would have loved to get more of the delicious mozzarella in my mouth but sadly it was only on two bites on my slices.  The worst part was that both pizzas that we ordered were burnt.  Not just on the edges but the burnt flavor was throughout the pizza.  They also up sold us two pizzas letting us know that they were personalized pizza size.  But two people can definitely fill up on 1 13 inch pizza.  This was very pretentious so if you are going to be that snooty, you should deliver more than soggy burnt pizza with great but sparse toppings."

I was greeted at the door by Jessica, who I came to know was one of the proprietors of this remarkable little pizza joint.  She had some great pointers on the menu, and steered me through the draft beer choices.  Throughout my dinner, she hung out and chatted here and there, visiting with most of the tables in a kind-hearted and genuine way.  They definitely care about the quality and presentation of their food here, but also about their customers here.  I ended up ordering the Calabrese pizza, a spicy, salami clad affair and the Dunkel from the Nashville based YeeHaw brewery.The pizza was on delicious, the fire-kissed crust surrounded cheesy deliciousness with enough salami on the pie to satisfy a growing boy like me.  If I had it to do again, I might ask to have it left in the oven for a hair longer, but that's a largely personal preference.  As it stands, a delicious pizza.They had around fifteen parking spots along the side of the building, all full when I arrived. No worries here, but be prepared, you may have to get creative/take a little walk.I appreciate the restaurant's spacious layout and open seating arrangements, lending a bit of room between your neighbors.  Given the decidedly modern interior with nothing to really soak up the sound, it was close to a full house when I arrived and the noise level was never an issue in the slightest. Bustling, but not extremely crowded. TLDR: Great pizza, local ingredients, impassioned proprietors, big smiles, try the gelato."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Joe D.,"Dandridge, TN",1/21/2021,5.0,A Dopo  has one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten.It is definitely the best in Knoxville.I very clean cute restaurant. Excellent service and the best pizza. A must try.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Gianfranco D.,"Chicago, IL",10/30/2020,2.0,"The restaurant was almost empty, we were only 2 people. We wanted to order a pizza, and make it an early night.  The hostess asked us to wait while she checked her table reservations, came back after a couple minutes and told us that she wouldn't have a table for us for at least 45 minutes to be safe.  Once again, the restaurant was almost empty.  Did you ever hear the saying,"" a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush""? To turn away paying customers is a big no no.  Last time that we even attempt to come here."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Aud W.,"Memphis, TN",10/28/2020,5.0,"SO GOOD!!! This was maybe the best pizza I've ever had. Service was great, food was great, drinks were great, gelato is great."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jody C.,"Knoxville, TN",9/13/2019,5.0,"We are lucky enough to have a wealth of diverse pizza options here in Knoxville. Until A Dopo, it was a bit more standard fare. They come along, changed the game.Uniqueness and quality are probably the best descriptors of A Dopo's wonderful pizza. The first time I ever made it by, I had to pull out the phone to Google some of the ingredients. Which made me have a lil bit of a delayed excitement. Not only do they have have unique toppings, those toppings are unbelievable in flavor. One of the toppings I had was a kind of sausage, and I would have loved just a plate full of it. So delicious!Almost it's own reason to go to A Dopo: their gelato. They had a blackberry gelato that I asked if I could just have the tub. Good lord, so good."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Quintin M.,"Oakwood, Knoxville, TN",2/12/2021,5.0,"It's the best pizza I've ever tasted and I'm a pizza snob. I've worked at high end restaurants and tried many kinds of pizza with quality product but this takes the cake. Mannnn trust me when I say ""Best Pizza"". So what are you waiting for, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain...including satisfactory weight."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,erin w.,"San Antonio, TX",7/14/2021,4.0,"Yummy pizza, a bit out of the way of downtown but worth the walk.  Got the pizzicletta which was yummy and light and the sopresetta which had a great spicy kick to it, crust was so light and chewy it didn't fill you up like a normal pizza crust would."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jeffrey C.,"Lake Forest, IL",8/6/2021,5.0,First time having sourdough crust. It was really good! The gelato was excellent. Eli was a phenomenal server. Great personality and knowledge about the restaurant. Eli made it even more enjoyable.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Cooper D.,"Knoxville, TN",12/17/2020,5.0,"Wow! Incredible pizza and sourdough bread. I finally tried this place after hearing countless reviews. It lived up to the hype. This is a must try! My friend got the sourdough bread and olive oil for an appetizer. It was fresh warm homemade bread. That is hands down the best bread I have ever had! Bread will sadly never be the same. I then ordered the Soppressata pizza. It had cheese, basil, and salami. I then added homemade spicy sausage. That pizza was incredible. It was super fresh and had a thin crust. The best pizza in town! Afterwards we got their Gelato. Another great addition to the meal. Dark chocolate was delicious but not very strong. I highly recommend this place. This is top tier pizza and with top tier also comes a higher price. Worth it but pricey."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Christy B.,"Fishers, IN",11/24/2020,5.0,"Amazing, delicious pizza. I stop everytime I drive through Knoxville."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Courtney M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",12/27/2020,5.0,"Best pizza in Knoxville time and time again (for Neapolitan style lovers)! I always go for the white pizzas but tried out a red top and was not disappointed. Both styles are so light with amazing topping combinations, any choice is sure to be a great one. Glad the pies are light because I ate my whole pizza and still had just a bit of room left for some fruity pebble gelato! Pistachio is an all time favorite though. Facilities are also sparkling clean with social distancing enforced and all employees wearing masks. A must try for Knoxville!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kevin L.,"Minneapolis, MN",9/20/2018,5.0,"This place is absolutely awesome! Love the vibe, the service is great and the pizza is some of the best this side of Europe. Then the gelato! Overall, as good as it gets."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Stephanie T.,"Chattanooga, TN",4/30/2018,4.0,"This place is good. Seriously good. It's very hipster-friendly. Simple tables and chairs, community seating at the big tables. Met up with some co-workers here, one of whom knows this place well as the rest of us were from out of town. She did the ordering with some input from us. First we had a salad. It was a kale and lentil salad. I really don't care for kale, and that's not there fault. The seasoning and dressing were delicious though. My suggestion might be that they have more than one salad option a day. I know I'm in the minority of kale lovers, but there has to be others. Say I'm not the ONLY one. Then we had 3 different pizzas, one had arugula on it and was a white pizza. That was very good, with the bit of spiciness from the arugula to the coolness of the white sauce. A great yin-yang type pizza. And yes, the crust is amazing. Then there was a cheeseless pizza. WHAT? Pizza with no cheese? Is that even legal? One of our group requested it and man, it was really good. I don't think I would have ever thought about having pizza without cheese on it, but it worked. The sauce really came through and it wasn't overpowering. Really a great pizza.Our last pizza had meat on it and some sort of sweet and spicy combo thing that really worked. I'm a sucker for contrasting flavors, and this was one of those.  The house red wine was really tasty too and went well with all the pizzas.Side note, or I should maybe have started with this. I heard the server say Frose' and I said, ""yes, please."" He brought that out first and it was not a drink, it was more like a sorbeto. No problem. I ate it first and enjoyed every bit of it. So delicious!!!! So yes, I ate dessert first. That's just how I roll. Overall it was a very lovely experience."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Duncan Y.,"Knoxville, TN",4/24/2020,5.0,"My wife and I are new to the Knoxville area from South Florida.  We relocated here last September.  We've been experimenting with restaurants since here and have had a couple of places we'd like to visit again, but not many.  A LOT of chain restaurants in the area.Since the COVID19 quarantine we haven't had delivery or curbside for a while. We've really missed our fave pizza restaurant in SoFla.    Not any more.  We had the pleasure of ordering from A Dopo tonight and we thought it would be fun to order the Trust Fall for Two. Trust Fall for Two @$65.00The menu is Staff's choice, includes:Two pizzas with condimentsOne appetizerOne gelatoOne bottle of winePlease put any allergies or special requests in the ""special instructions"" box.  We will do our best to accommodateWe requested the salad for the app and my wife requested a veggie pie.Wow.  We picked up the order without issue.  The two staff members we encountered were awesome.  (Sorry, don't know their names).  The salad was superb. The wine was fun.  The gelato was delicious.  And the pizza?  Fabulous.  Now we understand that this pizza is a variation A Dopo devised for the quartintine.  That's OK.  Looking forward to trying their Neapolitan pizza once we're all through the COVID crises. We're not missing our SoFla pizza anymore and I can assure you we will return.  So good."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Chelsea B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/26/2021,3.0,"Everyone loves it here, but I like toppings on my pizza. I think they really skimp on them and not enough sauce or cheese. Not my thing personally. It's fine but not something I seek out."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Atlee M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/7/2020,5.0,"Looking for love? Look no further, because you will fall in love with A Dopo. It is magical little spot.  Typically, it is very busy, so be prepared to wait. If it is a nice night, your kids can play in the grass area out front. I like the rank places by taste, atmosphere, and how I feel after. So here are those rankings:Taste: fresh, bright, bold, sweet, hot and everything else. We ordered three different pizzas; two white sauce based and one red sauce based. The texture of the sourdough bread was perfect. No spot was to tough and it was evenly cooked all the way through. I highly encourage you to order one with meats and one with the lighter veggies, like arugula. Don't leave without trying a gelato! Atmosphere: Simple, yet profoundly romantic. The lighting is lower enhanced by candles at every table. The pizza prep area is open so you can watch the giant stone oven. The windows all the way across the front bring so much natural light in. One wall is covered in logos of other local places in town and that is a joy to look at and chat about so many mother places. How I feel after: dreaming about going back and trying every thing on the menu. While I don't eat pizza often, the whole experience left me feeling like I had escaped from real life for the most enjoyable night with fresh food and friends. Just my the heart needs!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Alan S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/4/2020,5.0,Oh my DOPO gelato!!! Pizza is amazing at this place. Not going to try to explain or take pics just try it and find out. Amazing.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Justina R.,"Sevierville, TN",2/27/2020,5.0,Consistently fantastic food and service. I would recommend this to anyone who comes through Knoxville.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Sara F.,"Linden, VA",2/24/2020,5.0,"Great pizza, I recommend for date night with your s/o for some delicious pizza. Worth the price!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ceri F.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2020,5.0,"Ordered a margarita pizza. Red sauce, House made mozzarella, basil and olive oil. It is amazing and delicious in it's simplicity. The subtle flavor of sour in the sourdough crust and the toothsome was awesome! It is definitely worth the trip downtown.We also ordered a white pie. The Pizzicletta pizza. This is top with white sauce, a 16 month age prosciutto and then topped with arugula dressed with lemon juice and olive oil pizza it was wonderful. The pepperiness of the arugula paired well with the zip of the lemon juice. Was fantastic with a creamy white sauce and prosciutto.Even though we were all full, we could not pass on the gelato. We each got a flavor so that we could try a little of each. We ordered Stracciatella, Pistachio and dark chocolate gelato. The Stracciatella is very much like a vanilla ice cream with shaved chocolate mixed. The dark chocolate gelato was luscious. Thick rich and ever so slightly sweetened. Our favorite was the one recommended by our waiter, the pistachio. This is not one that we would normally have ordered on our own. But I tell you what it was the best of the three ice cream's!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kleopatra G.,"Nashville, TN",2/15/2020,4.0,"This place is a breathe of fresh air for Knoxvillians who love pizza. Actually, for bougie Knoxvillians who love artisan pizzas. I felt like I was back in Nashville. The pizza is delicious, I only have one complaint. Not enough basil on the Margherita pizza. The pizza only has like 4 ingredients so you can't skimp on any of them. The house wine is also very good and affordable. The wait wasn't too bad for a Saturday night, I think this place likes to appear more busy than they really are. I will definitely be back for a wine and pizza night."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Blake W.,"Old City, Knoxville, TN",2/2/2020,5.0,"WHEN THE MOON HITS YOUR EYE LIKE A BIG PIZZA PIE THATS - A Dopo! An incredible pay-day pizza spot! We waited an hour and a half  (rookie-move,  because pro tip: they have a waiting list you can join on their website) but it was worth every minute. It's obvious their ingredients are top-notch quality, something you could taste in every bite. If you like spicy anything, I highly recommend adding the Calabrian peppers to your pizza!While the food was tasty, the service made for a really great experience. When we checked  in, the host recommended a  place nearby to  have a drink while we  waited for a table. When we came back, they offered us drinks since our table wasn't quite ready yet. With a packed house, it was surprising to get this level of attention. We'll be back!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",1/31/2020,5.0,"Bathroom: two clean single occupancy Baby changing table: noThere is just something so special about these sourdough pizzas coming out of the wood burning oven. My favorite go-to pizza is the soppresata that I do not share with anyone else at the table. It has the right about of spiciness from the meat that makes this pizza option on point. You may think that this is not a big deal but to me it is everything: sparkling water on tap. Let me tell you, I can drink a fortune of sparkling water. A great appetizer to share amongst the table is the ovoline--house made mozzarella with pesto and sourdough bread. If you are a fan of olives, get a side of the castelvetrano olives and have them warm it for you. Let me warn you, this side order can be pricey. If they fix it up real nice with garlic and olive oil than that can cost you up to $9. However, ask for it plain jane and it'll run you a few dollars. Their house made gelato is always rotating and the pistachio flavor is to die for. Nothing artificial and everything is so real with plenty of nuts.Pro tip: add yourself to the waitlist which can be found when you search the business on google."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Maggie M.,"Blountville, TN",1/20/2020,5.0,The staff here made my first experience a pleasant one. The menu though confusing at first glance was quickly explained & was very satisfied with the food! Two pizzas perfect for three people!

And the staff was so nice, Jessica went above and beyond for our to go order. We pressed the special pizza with rosemary, lemon, garlic and some other magic flavors- highly recommend. We also got the sourdough with pesto and fresh mozzarella appetizer - again, highly recommend."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Nancy S.,"Lakemont, GA",3/20/2019,5.0,"Love this place. Food is incredible. Atmosphere, amazing. Only complaint is that it can be loud - so not a great place for easy conversation. But great energy, nonetheless. Certainly the best pizza in Knoxville. Am a HUGE fan of wood burning pizza ovens. Great crust texture, flavor and char. And the gelato might be the best I've ever had. The salted caramel was spectacular. Wish Knoxville had more restaurants with this vibe."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kyle H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2019,5.0,This is our go to spot in Knoxville! Can always count on a great environment with even better food and service! Love spending our time here.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Keva M.,"Henrico, VA",6/2/2020,5.0,"So so good omg! I am a Neapolitan pizza connoisseur.  And I haven't had one yet that has truly blown me away since moving from Richmond, Va to Atlanta. In Richmond I always ate Puppatella. Atlanta has some greats but none truly compare. Who knew KNOXVILLE would have the better pizza?! So good. Super fruity olive oil, perfect crust, sauce and cooking technique. Check them out!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Madi F.,"Madison, WI",9/5/2020,5.0,Truly a fantastic pizza. Better than anywhere I've been in the USA. Not to mention a great and reasonable wine selection. Go to this spot ASAP!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Katy U.,"Midtown, Nashville, TN",10/27/2019,4.0,"The service here was really great. We called ahead to let them know that we were on our way in, and there was a table ready for us within five minutes of arriving. The clientele was a mix of people there on dates and people coming after the UT game. The wine and beer were reasonably priced, and the pizza was delicious. Good quality mozzarella and salami, and the crust was delicious. I think that the pizza could have been cooked slightly longer to get a little more crisp on the bottom, but overall delicious. Definitely recommend the soppressata pizza. My friend ordered a white pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Nick R.,"Gilbert, AZ",3/24/2020,5.0,Very good pizza and not just good for Knoxville good for anywhere. Staff is very friendly and cool prices seem on par for the quality. Will be back.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dee K.,"Centreville, VA",8/5/2019,5.0,"Cute little gem That was recommended to us. Did not disappoint. Rose and house Red were not my favorite, however the service, delicious pizza and gelato made up for it."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Mallory J.,"Las Vegas, NV",8/24/2019,5.0,Quite honestly the best pizza I've ever had. Came here on a recommendation while I was on a business trip and I can't wait until I'm in Knoxville again to go back!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,TN C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/20/2018,5.0,"What can I say that hasn't already been said. Fresh ingredients, home made mozzarella, home Made marinara sauce, home made gelato, fresh herbs everything is wonderful ! It's just bellissimo !It's a bit small and quaint inside. The staff is friendly and very helpful. It was packed and we arrived but luckily we did not have to wait since we used their reservation online app called No Wait - as soon as we arrived we were seated!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Canny F.,"Brooklyn, NY",5/6/2017,4.0,"I hit up some yelpers last minute to join me and it finally worked out! We came on a Friday at 5:30pm to avoid the wait. There is parking to the side of the restaurant but I'm sure if it was busy you would have to look for parking elsewhere. I noticed there are lots under the highway but I'm not sure if that's free. So what is so different about this pizza? It's the chewy crust I love to consume! It's extremely thin but the crust is spot on. This is what I call pizza. I ordered the beetroot and I was a tad disappointed. I think if it was topped with arugula and had chunks of mozzarella, it would have been perfect. Maybe I should have went with my usual choice of mushrooms? Yes, the beets were a different taste to a pie but the cheese was so melted and watery that I barely tasted it. It was similar in consistency to a watery salsa; when you dip the chip, nothing stays on it but it gets a hint of color from touching the salsa. But I loved this type of dough for pizza so I can't really give it a low rating. I also decided to eat my pie with utensils and that really slowed my pace down. I could have totally downed the pie in a few minutes but with the utensils it took me forever but I definitely appreciated it more. Interior: communal tables, limited tables, they could probably have more seating and make it less spaced out. I love their wall design near the kitchen and the fact that you can see them making the pies. The pistachio gelato bumped this rating a star. It was so good! It had pieces of pistachio and it wasn't sugary sweet. It tasted similar to gelato from Italy! I miss those gelato days. FYI: sparkling water is free. If you like the bubbly nose feeling, order it! I stuck with the free water that came in the fancy wine bottles."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jorge G.,"Union, KY",7/12/2019,5.0,"Delicious pizza, I tried the white with lots of arugula and my wife the white with mushrooms, both highly recommended. Nice atmosphere and good service."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rebecca N.,"Knoxville, TN",3/8/2020,5.0,"One of my favorite places in Knoxville! So many delicious and bold flavors of pizza. I've never had something I didn't like. STARTERS: The Insalata Verde is the perfect starter salad. Very light, fresh, seasonal, and well dressed. The Ovoline starter is basically pesto and mozzarella heaven in your mouth - probably heavy for just two people before pizza but perfect for 3+. Mushroom Pate is a yummy, lighter option I always want to call a tapenade - I probably get this one the most when I want a true tasty appetizer I can't get anywhere else. It is the perfect portion for a starter for two. PIZZA: Beetroot: Whenever I get this, people always stare at it waiting for me to order them a slice. The small beet chunks mixed into the melted gorgonzola on the perfect fire-oven pizza is a surprisingly satisfying and savory combination. Next is SPICY GREENS. I'll be honest, this one I had to trust the reviews on to order, I was skeptical. This is white sauce, mozzarella, kale, lemon, and chiles. It is wild how good this tastes! I order it almost every time I come to A Dopo now. They always have great specials as well. To drink we usually do a glass or two of the wine on tap. Highly recommend everything I've had here! Great service too. :)"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dee O.,"Knoxville, TN",2/8/2017,5.0,"I have eaten here quite a few times now. Perhaps an embarrassing number of times but the food is that good. Interestingly, I had never been a pizza person. In my previous life, I probably ate pizza 2 times a year. Always when it was free. I never intentionally drove to a pizza place to order pizza. And certainly never two days in a row. Well, A Dopo changed all that. Now I have a new life. One post A Dopo. Everything I have had has been delicious but the pizzicletta is by far my favorite. Service is always on point. And you should most definitely save room for gelato. I recommend the espresso gelato, even though I also don't drink coffee :)"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Blaine W.,"Indianapolis, IN",6/9/2019,5.0,"Wow! I loved this place, great atmosphere and wonderful brick oven pizza.  The pizza has a nice crisp edge and chewy Center.  I went with the tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, sopresatta, and pepperoni.  They carry beer from local craft breweries and have great service."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Mary Y.,"Atlanta, GA",5/14/2019,5.0,"This spot was a hole in the wall for me. I did not know this spot existed, nor saw this place because the restaurant is a little bit hidden. You would drive by and not notice it if you weren't really looking for it. The inside is small. So there's not a whole lot of seating. The restaurant itself was pretty packed when I went as well. The pizza spot does oven brick to cook the pizza, which is always the best option. I ordered the spicy greens, which it wasn't spicy. I did think that they over did it a little on the lemon. So if you're not a lemon flavored person, do not order this. They do have chili oil that you can ask for to dip, which is what I did to add the kick to it. They also ask if you want sparkling water or regular. Definitely, def go for the sparkling. It was super tasty. It wasn't too bubbly. My friends who typically don't like sparkling water have also enjoyed it. Def want to come back to try some of their others!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dan H.,"Tucson, AZ",12/28/2018,3.0,"Nice try but really disappointed.  After reading many good reviews I expected something at least better than Dominos Pizza but what we got was a gooey tuff crust nightmare.  We ordered two types of Rosa style pizzas and both were bad news. The flavor was ok but what made the pizza bad was the texture and consistency of the crust. It tasted somewhat like Indian Nan bread (which I like) only it was soggy, gooey, and so tough it was like chewing gum.  I left with a sore jaw from chewing.  Wine by the glass choices were very limited and also disappointed. The dark chocolate gelato was extraordinary and free sparkling water were the highlights of an otherwise bad experience. My recommendation:  frozen pizza is better."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Vanessa N.,"Norcross, GA",5/8/2017,4.0,"I like thin crust pizza, and I don't like it too crispy.  They make it right here. Well, it was almost right. The white sauce is a bit thin so at the end the crust felt a bit soggy. The thin sauce also watered down some of the flavor. The pistachio gelato is a must have! It's the sole reason I rounded up the rating. There was a generous amount of pistachios  (whole and chunks) and wasn't overly sweet."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,George L.,"Knoxville, TN",12/24/2019,4.0,This place was a great time kind of in a ugly part of town and not much around it but the food I had their was great. The pizza is all made from their special sourdough and cooked in a brick oven so it is a great quality bread that your getting a different than most boutique pizza shops they also have ice cream there that I thought was the best part because my mouth was wanting something sweet after such a savory pizza. The options for pizza are not many unfortunately I felt constrained to this menu and wanted to be able to make my own pizza. The sizes are more personal style pizza so expect to pay for a large dominos pizza but get half the size. I would say that I don't think they had fountain beverages but I may be wrong. They do bring you out a tiny glass for water that was really annoying always having to refil it especially when your eating salty pizza no one has time for frequent refills and having to buy water to fill up the jug for the table. It was a good experience but to our of the way for me to go again
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Becky B.,"Knoxville, TN",10/17/2018,2.0,"To be continued..... I shall explain myself. A group of 8 of us walked in on a Saturday afternoon... first mistake was that a group of 8 actually wanted to eat here because their is only like 2 tables that fit that amount of people and they were all taken. Host was nice but not very guiding especially because it was our first time there... we waited right in front of the host table because their is literally no waiting area to sit at and it was too cold outside to wait. So I felt like I was in the way of the waitresses going back in fourth because their was a glob if 8 people just there in the middle of the restaurant. We decided to just leave.. because we felt uncomfortable. So I'm not giving up, I will return just with my husband and have date night here and give it a try before I fully leave a negative review."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kyle D.,"Lancaster, PA",2/20/2021,5.0,The food was amazing! The service was terrific. I'll definitely be going back for more sourdough
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Wayne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",10/2/2016,5.0,"SERIOUS SOURDOUGH PIZZA When every dish you order in a restaurant is bursting with one or multiple flavors and textures and colors, the place is a top-notch find. A Dopo is just such a restaurant. The only other pizza I've ever had that was this good was in Dogliani, Italy, in 2008, which I remember oh-so-fondly and often.For a ""soft opening"" Saturday night, there were three pizzas on the menu. ""Margherita"" with crushed tomatoes, house pulled moz, basil and olive oil. ""First Night White"" with mascarpone, pecorino, sweet potato greens(!), potatoes, speck ham and thyme. ""Beetroot"" with crushed tomatoes, beetroot, oyster mushrooms, moz, pea shoots, sea salt and house vinegar. All were excellent!Gelato was for desert. It's house made ""fresh garden mint,"" ""roasted pistachio,"" and ""chocolate sea salt."" Ditto . . . terrific! Chef Brian Strutz, another of the ex-Blackberry Farm chefs who are now running their own places here, must have worked to perfect the gelato recipes for months and months. Difficult to pick the winner among them . . ."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Wayne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",8/26/2016,5.0,"SERIOUS PIZZA Another much anticipated restaurant, this time A Dopo Sourdough Pizza, to open in about mid-September by another Blackberry Farm hand, Brian Strutz. The 1,000-degree oven is in place. the floors are about finished. And soon he'll even be making his own mozzarella and possibly burrata and sourdough bread for a few lucky customers!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Alisha K.,"White Lake, White Lake charter Township, MI",1/23/2021,5.0,"We are from out of town and tried this place for the first time tonight - amazing! The pizza is so good and the ingredients are so fresh. We got the ovoline for the appetizer, the nduja and mushroom pizza and the ""special"" pizza that had pepperoni and Calabrian chiles. It was all so good! Our waitress was great and not only helped us with the menu but also gave us a taste of the caramel gelato after our meal. Try this place - you will love it!!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,MaryJane M.,"Cedar Bluff, Knoxville, TN",1/23/2021,5.0,Always a date night favorite! The to go menu is a bit limited from their regular menu but pizzas are larger. Curbside is always fast and reliable. Inside service is great too if you're comfortable dining in as they practice terrific covid safety measures.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Mengya L.,"Knoxville, TN",9/4/2018,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants in Knoxville for sure. There're always so many people. Came on a Saturday night after game, parked along the street and surprising got seated immediately. Our waiter is really nice. The Riesling is great, just the right sweetness for me. Ambience level is ok. The greens (salad) have lots of flavors, leafs are fresh. The mushroom pizza is awesome, if you like mushroom that one is a must. (The spicy sausage-taste add-on is strongly recommended.) Got another pizza to share for three of us, which have shredded mozzarella on top of greens, we love it too. It took a little bit longer for the pizza to came to our table, but it totally worth it, will definitely come back!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,M C.,"Washington, DC",2/9/2021,5.0,I've been meaning to try this place for a while and finally got a chance to last night. The pizza was fantastic and the staff were so sweet. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Gianna L.,"Cleveland, TN",12/29/2020,5.0,"Amazing!!! My favorite pizza place is in Atlanta, GA called Antico. The pizza here is very VERY similar to the pizza I usually get at Antico."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Erika R.,"Knoxville, TN",8/2/2018,5.0,"My favorite meal in Knoxville in a hot minute! From the first bite of bread our server brought us on a tiny plate with some olive oil for dipping, we knew we had hit someplace special. Two of us shared the mushroom pate, the salad of the day (shredded kale, roasted sweet potatoes, lentils), and the margherita pizza. Wowsers! The salad was huge and was more than enough to share. As trendy as it is, I really don't like the taste of kale, but however it was prepared took the bitterness out of it. The mushroom pate was served with more slices of bread, and while it was tasty, I think our shock at how delicious the bread was with simple olive oil tempered our love of the pate. And the pizza, of course, was just as good as everyone says it is. The fresh mozzerella was something else! And our server brought us each a sample of their house-made gelato. There were 5 or 6 flavors to choose from, one vegan and the rest made with milk. We got blueberry goat cheese and something else with berries and it was the BEST GELATO IN THE WORLD. I can't wait to have this whole dinner experience again!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Emma C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/4/2021,5.0,"BEST pizza in Knoxville, hands down. I have legitimately shed a tear over how incredible my meal was (was a blush pie special with okra & gold tomatoes *chefs kiss*). The pistachio gelato is always delicious. Can't recommend this spot enough, just go and see for yourself!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Carol D.,"Palmetto, FL",1/8/2021,5.0,"All I can say is OMG best pizza ever and we have eaten a lot of pizza in Chicago, and New York and this is just as good if not better . They give you olive oil with the bread it's so good I could just eat bread and olive oil.  This place is amazing"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Stephen C.,"Knoxville, TN",6/17/2020,4.0,"Pretty good. Went on a date here the other night. (yes a date with a female person.) It went well, food was good. Water in a glass bottle that they let you keep at the table. Cool cool stuff. Would go back. Also hoping to go on another date with the female."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Haleigh S.,"San Bernardino, CA",12/31/2020,5.0,Great food and service. The only thing I wish we had known ahead of time was that you really should book a reservation. The first time we tried to go here we couldn't get a table and the hostess told us the best way to not wait for hours (on the weekend) is to book a reservation. I guess they seat people who have to reservations on the weekends and it only take walk ins if you get lucky! We made a reservation today and everything was great!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Frank M.,"Northford, CT",12/13/2018,4.0,Tried this spot yesterday-it was worth the trip to Knoxville-thin crust pies made to perfection-being from the northeast it had been hard to find pizza we're used to here in East Tennessee THIS IS THE PLACE!!! They've got both red & white pies with interesting topping combinations along with the tried & true basic mutz & some sort of meat pie-very tasty-eclectic patrons & servers well done ADOPO-by the way they also make a great gelato for dessert!!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Travis T.,"Spring Mill, KY",5/19/2019,5.0,The pizza was awesome. Loved the sourdough crust that was baked perfectly. I love my pizza with some char on it. Fresh hunks of mozzeralla on the pizza. Their house make sausage was spicy and zesty. This is the first place I have visited with carbonated water in addition to just water. The wait staff was top notch and very helpful. Good selection of regional beers on tap too. Will be back soon!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Juan N.,"Knoxville, TN",12/18/2020,5.0,"Absolutely incredible pizza!! Staff is extremely friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere is fantastic!! Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try their amazing sour dough pizza. We had the margarita and we can't wait to grab another!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Karli S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/20/2019,5.0,"The only place I go to for pizza in Knoxville. Recently found out I'm allergic to basically everything on pizza, but  by God, I am still going to A Dopo. The annual pizza and wine dinner every Black Friday is a family tradition. Pro tip: if you want gelato, ask your sever to reserve a scoop of the flavor you want when you order pizza. Some flavors can sell out quickly. Their sparkling water is strangely superior to all other sparkling waters. Don't ask me why, it's just one of those A Dopo blessings."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Chico O.,"Knoxville, TN",1/10/2020,5.0,"Everything I had here is on point and delicious! Appetizer, pizzas, dessert...service is friendly, it's casual and relaxing. Our favorite date night spot."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Wendy E.,"Knoxville, TN",3/10/2019,5.0,"If you are looking for amazing pizza....this is your spot!   I had heard a podcast interview with Cassidee Dabney, the Executive Chef at Blackberry Farm, and she was really talking up how great this place is, so naturally, we had to try it.  Arrived around 5:30pm on a Sunday afternoon and was seated immediately but the place filled up very quickly.  The service was prompt and all of our food was brought exactly as ordered.  My husband enjoyed some of the white wine they offered and said it was great!  We ordered the olivene as a starter and goodness gracious! Amazing!!!!  The mozzarella was the absolute BEST!   We each ordered different pizzas and devoured them.  I cannot convey how impressed I was with this place in this post.  The atmosphere was great. Lots of people, yet not too loud. Could easily carry on a conversation without raising our voices.  Excellent parking available.  Wine list, craft/local beers, and friendly servers. I'm not sure why we waited so long to try it out but I encourage you to give it a try.  Locally owned...aka NOT a chain...and we love to support local restauranteurs!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Matthew H.,"Atlanta, GA",5/28/2018,5.0,"The salad, pizza and gelato was all great! My wife and I split everything and it was enough to satisfy us. The sparkling water is a must to order, and they make it in house. Everything about this restaurant is 5 stars. You won't go wrong with whatever you order."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Chance K.,"Knoxville, TN",9/18/2018,5.0,"Ohhhhhh man do they make some good pizza. In a world full of big corporate pizza chains, we need heroes like A Dopo to step out from the shadows. I am fairly certain I have eaten pizza at every place in Knoxville and can say with complete faith that they are the best game in town. They get super busy so get there early."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Stephanie B.,"Knoxville, TN",11/7/2018,5.0,Best pizza I have had in Knoxville! Highly recommend! All my friends and I fell in love with honey on a pizza!

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rachel C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/26/2018,3.0,The sourdough is amazing delicious and the pizza has tons of variety. The reason for the 3 was there was no place to change my baby's diaper. I had to go out to the car and change his diaper. It makes me hesitant to go back there for that reason.

The reason for the 2 was there was no place to change my baby's diaper. I had to go out to the car and change his diaper. It makes me hesitant to go back there for that reason alone.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rachel C.,"Knoxville, TN",2/18/2017,4.0,"The pizza was great and you definitely got the sourdough in the crust! We had a party of 6 and swapped slices so we could try a variety. They were all simple yet delicious. I had the beetroot, amazing! The wine on tap was okay. And Biffs best was great as always! I like the sparking water option! Nice atmosphere but a little pricey. We enjoyed ourselves but it's not an every weekend kinda place!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rogue C.,"Asheville, NC",9/12/2019,5.0,"This is without a doubt the best non-traditional pizza I've had. Even if the food wasn't so good the service is worth the trip. Big genuine smiles, helpful staff, and all around amazing experience. Great layout and atmosphere as well."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Sara V.,"Perimeter Center, Atlanta, GA",11/20/2020,5.0,"Fabulous food! Started with the mushroom pate which was a party for the taste buds!

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jeana H.,"Providence, RI",8/12/2018,5.0,"The best best best pizza. Always take note of the daily special because they are so unique. I frequently order to go pizza from A Dopo and it is as delicious as it is in the restaurant. I find myself texting friends on a weekly basis,  ""I'm craving a pizza from A Dopo!""Everything about A Dopo is pleasing- the pizza, the gelato, the wine, the atmosphere...go now!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jason H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/8/2017,4.0,"For upscale pizza in Knoxville, this place is the cat's meow.  Looking at the menu, you'll be hard-pressed to see something that you say ""wow, that looks familiar and good""...however, don't be fooled.  Every pie there is awesome.  Salads are fresh and tasty.  Everything is made from local ingredients and most of their stuff (sausage, cheese, etc) is made in-house.The only drawback is the lack of waiting space - as in, there isn't any.  However, if you're without kids (been there twice - once with kids, once without), put yourself in line (use the NoWait app) and walk down to the Public House, which serves as A Dopo's de-facto waiting area/bar on weekends.Super glad to have a place like this here to give diners another ""upscale"" option downtown."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Alison A.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",8/31/2019,5.0,Came in on a Saturday evening. While initially I was a bit put off that they didn't have a single tv in the place (I had promised my dad we'd finish watching the second half of the game there) I do have to say that one bite of the pizza shut me RIGHT up. It was amazing. Better than all the pizza I had in Italy. Incredible crust and a blazing hot oven means it came out crazy fast. We all ordered something different and every pizza was fantastic. Totally recommend. The staff was incredibly kind as well.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Anna J.,"Memphis, TN",8/8/2018,5.0,"I just got back from three weeks in Italy and I was so impressed by this place. Free sparkling water? Light pizza with stellar ingredients? Yes, please!We started with the salad of the day, which had kale, sweet potatoes, and other vegetables. Very refreshing and a good starter. Our sweet and attentive waiter (David?) recommended the nduja mushroom pizza which was delightful. My mom and sister split a bottle of red. One had the pizza special with honey and nduja and the other had the pizza with potatoes and gorgonzola. Both raved about their pizzas. Also, the Calabrian chile was incredible, get it on the side if you're questioning. I also had the goat cheese cherry gelato which was creamy and perfect after a spicy pizza. The only thing we were left wondering was if the employees were all models. I mean, come on! Great space, service, atmosphere, and food. The Italians would be pleased. Will be back!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dean C.,"Knoxville, TN",12/10/2019,5.0,This shop in Knoxville has the fresh ingredients to match the amazing dough and combined create an evening of flavors and depth that makes A Dopo so special.  We have eaten here about 100 times since they opened and always are excited to step back into the place that pizza is the priority and the salads/gelato are right in step.  Great fresh flavors each time we dine.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Seth J.,"Knoxville, TN",10/17/2019,5.0,"Some of the yummiest pizza in knoxville! Neapolitan style, fresh seasonal options, I'm going to have to return here."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Michael T.,"Knoxville, TN",6/26/2019,4.0,"I've ordered takeout three times, but have never dined in. While I wait for my food to go, it reminds me of any trendy artisan pizzeria in my former hometown of Los Angeles--cosmopolitan, hip, tasty, lively ambiance, but also high prices. You get what you pay for though, and they've got fresh ingredients and a delicious sourdough base for all their pizzas. Service is great and parking is plenty. I really want to give them five stars, but it's just a bit too expensive for individual-sized pizzas."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Tamara F.,"Chattanooga, TN",9/28/2019,5.0,"Best Pizza, hands down (that I have tried) within a 100 mile radius! The gelato was also amazing!!!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Betsy F.,"Knoxville, TN",11/9/2019,5.0,"Not just the best food but the best dining experience in Knoxville.  Go to spot for when you have friends in town and want them to see part of why you love Knoxville so much.  Great for dates but also for large groups (call ahead). Everyone you deal with is super cool and they all obviously love what they do, the food somehow keeps getting better and the atmosphere never disappoints.  My hands down favorite."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Trinity E.,"Knoxville, TN",9/28/2017,5.0,"OMG!!! This place... I can't even find the words to describe the goodness and mouthwatering flavors of their pizza! No words than , JUST GO!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Matthew M.,"Buckeye, AZ",7/9/2017,5.0,"Great pizza, service and atmosphere, well worth a 30 minute drive to have the best pizza in Knoxville! The pizzas are simple and fantastic! The pizza dough is so good that the crust tastes like fresh baked sour dough bread. They also have wine on tap! Did I say this pizza is worth a 30 minute drive out of your way to eat!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Greg K.,"12 South, Nashville, TN",10/23/2019,5.0,"This place is the best!!!! This place is phenomenal the food is great the atmosphere is cool, and the staff is amazing!!!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Al G.,"College Park, MD",7/27/2020,5.0,"A Dopo has always had really good pizza, but we just got take out from them for the first time since the pandemic started and they now have incredibly GREAT pizza. I don't know what they changed but I think I was saying ""omg this is so good"" every other bite. I got my go-to Margherita and my husband got his go-to pepperoni. They also increased the pizza size for takeout which is awesome because we have lots of leftovers now. So whatever they did to change their pizza (was the crust different? Saltier? Sweeter sauce? idk), IT WORKS."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Imran Q.,"Chattanooga, TN",6/3/2019,5.0,Great little place where they take pride in their product. The sourdough crust is a refreshing  change from heavier traditional crust.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Chardea N.,"Dunedin, FL",12/11/2019,5.0,"I so wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. My husband and I came to Knoxville after visiting Gatlinburg and we only had one night here. So we asked around what places were the best and a few said this is the best spot. So my husband and I chose to have a dish a few spots to try everything since we only had one night. This spot was our last one we walked to and we walked about 20 mins to get here, we walk up and see it's packed with people and then we see the sign on the door and start to walk away and I'm guessing the owner came running out to tell us that someone rented it out for a Christmas party. We were super bummed but we about to leave and she asked if we wanted a pizza anyway and of course, YES! I mean how incredibly sweet? She totally could have just had us leave which we would have understood but the fact that she still wanted to serve us?? Incredible. I literally gave her a hug! So sweet and can't wait to come back to this place. Oh and the pizza? WOW IS IT AMAZING! I told my husband it's hands down the best I've ever had, he agrees."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Hannah W.,"Clarksville, TN",10/3/2019,5.0,Amazing service especially with a full house Pizza was amazing tasted just like the one I had from a place In Naples Italy I will be coming here more often love this place
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Salmaan T.,"Washington, DC",1/27/2018,5.0,"Very unique menu, even outside of the sourdough crust. What puts this place as one of the best pizzas in Knoxville is the tomato sauce. The sauce is so flavorful and tastes very fresh. Delicious. Pizza did take what seemed like a bit longer than it should but there were two big groups so could have been that. Will definitely be back."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rachelle S.,"Greenville, SC",6/22/2017,4.0,"Staff: very friendly and helpful.  Our waitress provided great explanations of the food, made personal recommendations based on her tastes as well as what is the 'most popular' there, and identified the various ingredients we did not know.  This was quite helpful!Food: the food is very tasty!  I am not usually one to like wood fired pies, but they make theirs perfectly!  Not burnt on the outside and nice and fresh.  The pies are a bit thin, so be careful when you add ingredients.  My only complain was the gelato.  There were 3 of us so we each ordered something different.  I ordered the Toasted Marshmallow.  I was told how it was made (and it would be 'smoky') but I was not expecting it to taste like charcoal.  I was quite disappointed.  What disappointed me more was that when I told our waitress, she did not offer to replace it or anything.  None of us liked it and the next thing I saw was that the Marshmallow was crossed off of their menu board.  I am not sure if they ran out or if something was wrong with it.  Either way, it would have been nice to have something else to taste."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Sammy O.,"San Francisco, CA",5/27/2017,5.0,"Very good and fresh!  Wine and Beer on tap as well as in bottles.Service was awesome, vibe was nice and I love the creative pizza's and salad combos  they have dreamed up! Can't wait to go back"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Joe S.,"Powell, TN",3/25/2019,3.0,"I've heard about A DOPO for some time.  I'll admit up front, not a huge wood-fired pizza person due to it usually being burnt vs. standard oven pizza. At 9:15 on Saturday, the place was slammed.  Super super loud, so much so, zero way to have a conversation.  It's like being in a washing machine your entire meal.  Take Cafe 4', Cracker Barrel, and Not Watson's combined and add a few more decibels, this is the dining experience at A DOPO.  Upon ordering, I described my non-burnt preference to the waiter and he said he'd try, but some char was to be expected.  Awesome, loved his honesty.  Pizza came out in like 4 minutes.  Incredible.  Dough was really amazing, but not much cheese on the pizza.  It tasted clean.  I imagined that same dough being cooked in a standard oven in a quiet environment...and I bet it would have tasted better.  Two people, two beers, two pies, no tip came to $44.78.  It was worth about $30.  Maybe.   I saw some of the other Pizzas come out, one looked like grass clippings were on top??  I just don't understand this, so probably not the right place for us...but if you like really loud, expensive...this may be your spot!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Paisley T.,"Seattle, WA",10/2/2016,5.0,"FINALLY! We have a classy pizza spot in Knoxville. Upon arrival, we walked in and RIGHT AWAY were charmed by the understated modern look. And these wood fired pies are PERFECT! What a beautiful oven. It fires up such delicious CRUST.  It was such a treat to nosh on HOUSE MADE BURRATA on toasted bread before our pizza arrived. Double delicious. I'd give it a little bit more olive oil but it was very good. We agreed that the MARGHERITA pizza is hands down the best. The SAUCE on that pie is really really good. If you are a newbie to A Dopo you HAVE to order this pie. I liked the FIRST NIGHT WHITE pizza too but I think it needed some shaved parmesan cheese or some salt to just give it some more dimension. My only CRITICISM is that despite everything going on in this pie it NEEDED SOMETHING to bring out that long list of toppings. The wine was good, although I'd like to see a few more options. And the gelato was completely REFINED. Not your typical touristy gelato, folks. It was smooth and creamy and very high quality. I can't wait to COME BACK!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Lana S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/15/2016,5.0,"Outstanding gourmet pizza! Fresh ingredients meet chewy charred delicious crust -worth ingesting. I like eating in but I think I Love taking out! Virtually no wait when often times an hour plus can keep you from your take-in pie. The good news is whether waiting for a table, taking out or dining in, there's really good beer & wine to imbibe while you wait. If it get's too crowded while waiting for a table quench your thirst around the corner at the Public House. Any way you're slice it, your pizza is gonna be good -to go!! Oh & I've heard you need to stay to enjoy the house made gelato!! Tell me about it! Mangia Mangia! Cheers!!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Scott M.,"NJ, NJ",4/25/2019,5.0,"My review is based simply on the margarita pizza that I ordered. The dough was incredibly fresh and tasty, just the right texture. Sauce, cheese and spices on the pizza were very very good. I ate the whole pizza in my car before I got back to my hotel. If you're looking for authentic brick oven pizza this seems to be a great option and Knoxville."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dean C.,"Knoxville, TN",11/21/2018,4.0,Tasty pizza. They have a neat vibe and they make great pizza. I got a decent vegetarian pizza and the service is fast.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Teri O.,"Knoxville, TN",4/7/2017,5.0,"Ate here tonight and was blown away! I LOVE good pizza and this was amazing pizza. Not your typical pepperoni or deluxe stuff-all different and FRESH toppings. We had the special today. It had speck(which is my new fav meat-like a bacon, ham,canadian bacon on level 10!), mascarpone cheese base and argula with lemon and olive oil drizzle. Don't be afraid to step out of your wheelhouse and try! Awesome flavors!!! Had a quarte of wine(2 1/2glasses basically) for $6.50!! Total bill was 41.00 with tip for beer,wine and pizza!!  The 13"" pizza has 6 LARGE slices. Enough for two people!Will go back and recommend to anyone!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Sacre B.,"New York, NY",3/8/2019,5.0,A Dopo is my favorite pizza in Knoxville at this time. Their flavors are amazing and our server Amanda is completely awesome. She recognizes us every time and always comes over to talk. The flavors are amazing and the pizza is really good sized for 1 hungry person or two with an app. This is my neighborhood pizza place now when I am in Knoxville. The gelato is crazy good and you must save room for some. You can always mix two flavors in one cup.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Mat M.,"Knoxville, TN",11/21/2016,5.0,"I am an admitted Neapolitan pizza nut, and I will say that this place does the craft justice.  I had the margherita pizza which was wonderful and tasted the way it should have.  Everything seemed very fresh, even though they ran out of their home made mozzarella.  The house wine was great, and pretty cheap.  And the gelato was made in house and tasted as such.I did not know what to make of the word ""sourdough"" in their title in compared to how the Italians do it, but to me the crust tasted just the way it should.  The only thing I hope they one day get is an espresso machine.  Lastly, the two owners seem like really great people and I'm glad they're decided to take a chance open their place up!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Michael B.,"Knoxville, TN",10/7/2016,5.0,"My wife and I went to A Dopo during their official grand opening on Thursday. While we were expecting to love the food, we were still pleasantly surprised by how good everything was. I had the Sweet Potato Greens pizza, and with a good deal of reservation. I'm a very picky eater who usually sticks to relatively simple tastes and familiar foods. But I was shocked at how delicious it was. The sourdough crust was fantastic, and the Calabrian Chiles were remarkably tasty, complementing the pizza quite well. I would definitely recommend this pizza to anybody. My wife had the mushroom pâté, and found it not only filling but very enjoyable. We did have a slight bit of a wait at the beginning, but neither of us held it against the staff at all. It was their opening day, and they were still obviously getting used to the rush of customers. They were very apologetic about the *small* delay, and even gave us a free cup of gelato to thank us for our patience. Their espresso gelato was fantastic, and will definitely be something that we order in the future. All told, this was a wonderful little spot in an up-and-coming part of Knoxville, and offers a kind of pizza that you can't really get anywhere else. Go down, put your name on the wait list, and walk over to Crafty Bastard or The Public House and have a pint."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dusty P.,"Sylvania, OH",5/3/2017,4.0,"Don't be put off by the shady surroundings, this place is a gem. Rustic interior, very friendly staff, and amazing stone-fired pizza. Their sourdough pizza is the best of thick and thin crust, their salads have a house made vinagarette that is a little strong in acidity but great in flavor. Definitely save room for their house made gelato! 13"" pizzas are a perfect size and I highly recommend their white pzzas."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Scott S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/22/2019,5.0,"Where to start? This place has it all. Terrific service, great atmosphere and some of the best pizza you'll find on either side of the Atlantic. Pizza size is enough to fill you up if you're famished and perfect to share if you're not super hungry. Local beer selection is spot on. I can't wait to go back."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kasey F.,"Knoxville, TN",8/5/2017,5.0,"A Dopo pizza is an all around amazing restaurant and experience. The food is consistently delightful in taste and presentation. We love the tanginess and variety of the salad specials, and while we often consider the pizza special, we almost always come back around to the spicy greens and add speck ham! The servers are all so nice- the entire dining experience at A Dopo is amazing. We hardly ever have room for gelato, but it is undeniably delicious.We also love that they have rosé on tap!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Annie R.,"Clermont, FL",1/20/2019,5.0,"Yes. This place is worth a wait, worth the price, worth the drive. It is my absolute favorite! Do yourself a favor and add ""sweet hot"" to your pizza- it's a combination of honey and Calabrian chilis. So. Good. Gelato for dessert? Yes. Simple salad before the pizza? Yes. I love everything about A Dopo, and you will too!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Cody F.,"Knoxville, TN",1/17/2019,5.0,"Seriously, consistently the best pizza in Knoxville. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, the menu is terrific and diverse, and the drink selection is fantastic (beer, wine, and some wine on tap). Don't skip on the gelato, add the ""sweet hot"" to the pizza if you like some heat, and the ovoline starter (fresh mozzarella, basil and pistachio pistou, and flatbread) is a favorite."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Hayley J.,"Knoxville, TN",12/8/2019,4.0,"Great pizza and unique and yummy gelato offerings that change regularly. The dough is delightful, lots of fresh toppings with high quality meat options. I've Always a good experience at this restaurant. It's a good option for smaller family get togethers."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Meredith L.,"Decatur, GA",12/6/2016,3.0,"A friend in the know informed me about this place in its first opening weeks, so I decided to give it a try. I showed up early before the designated time to meet my friends, and I'm glad that I did so that I could add our name to the waiting list. We ended up waiting almost an hour for a table in this small place. I liked the low key vibe and the basic decor. We ordered some salads and pizza pies from their menus. The salad that I ordered, 'insalata verde' I believe, was definitely green alright and there weren't any other veggies on it. As a vegetarian I like getting my greens in but I'm disappointed to be confronted with a salad that doesn't have anything else on it. I need some variety in my salads. As for the pizza (I ordered the margherita), it had a nice texture from the wood fired oven but I wasn't overly impressed with the overall taste and the originality of having sourdough as the base didn't show up in my palette at least. I would come back here but hopefully with a shorter wait than this time."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Betsy L.,"Blowing Rock, NC",2/14/2019,5.0,"My favorite restaurant in Knoxville! Historically, I've held the very unpopular opinion that pizza is overrated, but A Dopo changed my mind. We go almost once a week and for special occasions. Best pizza ever."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Mark M.,"Oak Ridge, TN",8/20/2017,5.0,"I thought I knew pizza and ice cream before but oh my was I naive. The pizza was a nice Neapolitan crust and just the perfect amount of char. It was very difficult to stop eating. We were already satisfied with the pizza and considered not getting gelato, but we caved and are very glad we did. We got the pistachio and were first surprised to not see what we consider a normal pistachio ice cream. The pistachios were roasted and there were chunks of nuts in the gelato. It made for an amazing date night and we will definitely go back again."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Heather H.,"Knoxville, TN",8/19/2017,5.0,"This is a wonderful pizza and gelato place. The location is in the heart of downtown Knox, and great feel inside. The server was extremely helpful in navigating the fancy menu."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Turner M.,"Knoxville, TN",5/7/2019,4.0,"A unique pizza place in this city. A Dopo is a solid joint, and while it isn't the cheapest in town, you certainly aren't getting shorted on your dollar. It has a cool aura inside with a great selection of pizzas you couldn't get anywhere else in Knoxville. Don't be afraid of it's interesting location, check it out!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Lacy M.,"Orangeburg, SC",11/9/2016,5.0,"Ohh I wish I could give 5+ Stars! Absolutely incredible creative menu filled with red and white pizzas, fresh salads, and a VERY affordable wine list with Italian wines perfect for pairing. We had a white Pizza with house made andouille sausage, fresh greens and mozzarella. To die for. The staff is extremely friendly and an environment that creates a culture of community and conversation. And do not miss out on The pistachio gelato, perfect mix of sweet and salty to finish the meal! This is Soon to be One of Knoxville's best restaurants, get there quick!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Andy K.,"Knoxville, TN",7/15/2018,5.0,"Really delicious pizza, salads and gelato with a friendly & engaging staff made our evening here wonderful. I ordered the pizza margherita and my husband had the same but added pepperoni. To start we had fresh bread, homemade mozzarella, mushroom pate and pickles -all tasty. The pizzas were hot with a puffy and crisp crust, authentic topping with tomatoes, mozzarella & basil. Gelato for dessert and did not disappoint."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kelly Z.,"Mount Juliet, TN",5/3/2019,5.0,This place is truly a gem and makes me proud to be a Knoxvillian. Jessica and Brian share there passion for food with there amazing food. The environment is so friendly and the food is never left on our plate after a visit. Highly recommend.

Jessica and Brian share there passion for food with there amazing food. The envy is so friend and the food is never left on our plate after a visit. Highly recommend.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kelly C.,"Knoxville, TN",4/21/2020,5.0,"Just tried curbside pick up during the covid outbreak. Staff did a wonderful job and quickly brought out pizza. They wore secure masks and gloves and gave directions on how to reheat our pizza. The pizza was great, even my picky eater loved it. We tried the Roman with pepperoni."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Laura H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/9/2017,3.0,"Pros: cool atmosphere, it didn't take a long time for our food to come out, good pizza, easy parking Cons: burnt crust and expensive for pizza that didn't really impress. I mean, it was tasty but not so delicious that I was ready to spend 15+ for my mea again. Also the flatbread app was just ok as well."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Lydia H.,"Nashville, TN",4/18/2018,4.0,"The food was tasty, I enjoyed the sourdough pizza crust immensely. But the service was mediocre and the waiter seemed less than thrilled to be there, much less waiting on us. I'm in the service industry and I try to be as understanding as possible, and it could have been simply an off night for this person. But the general attitude and bare minimum helpfulness definitely tainted our experience."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Calvin D.,"Knoxville, TN",2/20/2018,5.0,This is one of our downtown favorites! Great service and fantastic pizza! I would recommend getting some of their wine on tap along with the Margarita pizza.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Josh W.,"Grand Haven, MI",3/29/2019,5.0,Best pizza is Knoxville by far. Every time I go I always leave very happy. Their gelato is also a perfect way to end a night! Keep an eye on their specials board! They always have creative pizzas on it!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Megan W.,"Knoxville, TN",12/14/2018,5.0,"Haven't been to A Dopo? Stop what you are doing and plan a dinner night there immediately. This is the most delectable pizza in Knoxville. I'm a vegetarian and really appreciate all the options I'm able to choose from. My vote for best pizza is the spicy greens. (Hot tip: Add local honey atop your spicy greens. I'm salivating just thinking about it.) My husband usually orders from the specials menu or opts for the marinara. We've never been disappointed in our meal here and the service is tremendous. Don't leave without ordering a cup of their in-house gelato! One of the best parts about A Dopo is that you can order from their wine list or BYOB (I believe there's a small corkage fee). Lastly, the atmosphere of A Dopo is both intimate and lively. It's a hot spot, so I recommend jumping on their wait list via Yelp before heading out the door -- especially on a weekend night."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Brooks B.,"Atlanta, GA",5/20/2018,5.0,"This place is a hidden gem. The service is super great and everyone is so friendly. Do not skip out on the gelato!! Definitely go for the full experience: wine, appetizer, pizza and gelato! Such a cute staple in Knoxville!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Colin C.,"Oak Ridge, TN",3/25/2018,5.0,"Hard not to say that this is most likely the best pizza I've had in Tennessee and maybe even in the United States. This place kills it, it is worth the wait, take your date and blow them away."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rachel W.,"Knoxville, TN",9/2/2017,5.0,This is by far the best pizza in Knoxville and maybe in the entire southeast. Every pizza is delicious. Favorites include spicy greens and sopressata! Add an egg for extra yummy goodness! The only negative is the appetizers. They cost $10 and have extremely small portions. Max 4 bites each. Put that money towards wine or more pizza. Skip the apps.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rachel M.,"Lafayette, CO",11/19/2018,5.0,"Amazing pizza! Best in Knoxville!  The white pizza with the Induja sausage and mushrooms is by far the best pizza on the menu. Adding some ""hot honey"" is also a great idea. Wine selection is small, but great. You can have unlimited sparkling water with your dinner for no extra charge, which for me is a reason in and of itself to come here. Ending the meal with any of their gelatos just puts the final touch on a top foodie experience. I've lived in many big cities, and  Adopo could make it big in any of them. Pro tip-- go immediately when they open or use the no-wait app. Don't just show up. You may end up waiting two hours to eat if you do. BUT if that happens... just give them your cell number to text you when the table is ready and head over to Public House (just down the street) for a cocktail while you wait."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Justina R.,"Sevierville, TN",2/27/2020,5.0,Consistently fantastic food and service. I would recommend this to anyone who comes through Knoxville.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Sara F.,"Linden, VA",2/24/2020,5.0,"Great pizza, I recommend for date night with your s/o for some delicious pizza. Worth the price!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Josh C.,"Alpharetta, GA",10/14/2018,4.0,"A Dopo makes great wood-fired pizza. They go for classic flavor over tons of options. There are basically nine different pizzas, four with a red sauce and five with white. The Ruchetta is really tasty, though the cheese is cut so thick and there is so much arugula that it was a challenge to eat. The service was superb."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Maggie M.,"Blountville, TN",1/20/2020,5.0,The staff here made my first experience a pleasant one. The menu though confusing at first glance was quickly explained & was very satisfied with the food! Two pizzas perfect for three people!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kelly V.,"Knoxville, TN",10/7/2016,5.0,"DELICIOUS!We had a big group go last night which I think was A Dopo's first official night. They did a great job! The hostess, possibly owner?, was super sweet and accommodating to us. We were (are) an annoying big group and she was very welcoming. The space is also really beautiful and I am so pleased that they sealed the floors as is. They did a wonderful job.We ordered a lot of food and there honestly wasn't much left over. That is how tasty everything was. At some pizza places the crust may be left behind, but not here. Their crust has such a nice texture. I didn't realize sourdough made such a good base for a pizza. My husband and I got the Mushroom Pate which came with pieces of sourdough. Very flavorful, but if you don't like mushrooms you won't like this. It came with a few pickled vegetables which was a nice palate cleanser for the real star of the night: pizza!Since we had a big table I got to try lots of different pizzas. Out of the white pizzas, we really loved the Sweet Potato Greens pizza. It has these delicious chilies on them that were spicy but still had a lot of flavor. I really loved the Sopresatta pizza because I could not get past how tasty their marinara sauce is. It is so good! I crave it today. It tastes really fresh and pairs nicely with the mozzarella that they do not skimp on. We got all of the gelato flavors (basil mint, pistachio, espresso and chocolate) but the Pistachio was the table favorite. It had a nice balance of sweet and salty. So good!As a group, we were so pleased with the service, prices and food. The drink prices are really reasonable. You can get draft or bottle beer and they have lots of Italian wines to chose from. Not only did we have a wonderful evening at A Dopo, I made a new best friend! Our server, James B, is very personable and sweet, which made our experience even better. He GAVE ME A MORRISSEY CANDLE which is super awesome and is in a place of honor in our home. I am listening to the smiths today in honor of him and his generosity. A Dopo, James B, A Dopo. Love, Neon Blood."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Madissen C.,"Knoxville, TN",1/18/2019,5.0,I spent the summer in Italy and this is pizza that reminds me of my time there. If you're looking for authentic Italian pizza this is the place for you. So good and a good array of different choices for pizza toppings. They've done a great job! Hope they stay for a long long time!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Cliff C.,"Louisville, TN",10/15/2016,5.0,"I dined here on opening night without my wife (took a pizza home to her) and we were both impressed by the sourdough and flavours A Dopo served up! My wife and I dined with A Dopo this evening. A great experience......starting with sparkling water followed by two great salads (Ensalada Verde and a Bulgar wheat smoked sweet potato) followed by two phenomenal pizzas! A Dopo serves up both somewhat traditional pizza flavours as well as some very tasty though unexpected combinations. 6 out of 5 stars! Follow up with some great A Dopo made gelato made with fresh flavours such as mint, or in-house roasted pistachios to name a few. This is NOT the typical greasy pizza most often encountered! It is wood fired, sourdough pizza topped with an interesting variety of tasty, healthy toppings!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Cinda S.,"Knoxville, TN",1/29/2018,4.0,"This is not your usual pizza joint! The restaurant is located in an out of the way place, and a little hard to find, but so worth it! The interior is on the small side and the industrial like decor gives it more of an urban like feel. I loved that our appetizer plates were mismatched pieces of old china.  Speaking of appetizers......the mushroom cashew Pate was delicious served with warm pieces of focaccia bread. The kale salad had roasted veggies and lentils on it with a wonderful vinaigrette. We ordered the potato pizza which my husband liked, but I however did not. I thought the gorgonzola cheese was way to overpowering - that is all I could taste! So I ordered the margarita pizza with the addition of mushrooms.  It was amazing. The super thin crust gets soggy fast so don't let it sit to long.  My last piece fell apart when I picked it up! The gelato was a perfect ending to our meal - we tried the chocolate pistachio and the almond cherry.  The almond cherry was our favorite hands down! Our waitress was so nice and friendly, and even tho there was not one empty table in the entire restaurant, she took her time answering our questions and never made us feel rushed. My only complaint would be to have more vegan/vegetarian options for pizza. We will definitely be back to eat here again ."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Miranda T.,"Morristown, TN",7/25/2018,2.0,"I was so excited to try this place out however I was extremely underwhelmed. I ordered the rushetta pizza, I was expecting melted cheese on it however it just had shaved Parmesan on top. I also tried my boyfriends pizza which had mozzarella and salami, which I also didn't enjoy. Both were lacking flavor and both were soggy. The only good part was the gelato, it was very creamy and delicious."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Joshua R.,"Lansing, MI",7/15/2018,5.0,"Yeah, it's as good as it sounds. It's perfect. Go."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Chris H.,"Albuquerque, NM",12/16/2018,5.0,Always great pizza here. Salads and gelato are worthy additions too. The only downside is difficulty getting a table.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Elizabeth H.,"Maryville, TN",10/24/2019,5.0,Very good pizza and accommodating to request. One of the best crusts that I have had recently.  Service was solid.  Friendly and willing to make recommendations.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Joy B.,"Cary, NC",6/13/2018,5.0,"We love pizza and this place knows how to make a good dough. We started with the house pulled mozzarella, olive oil and flatbread. Mozzarella was ok, would have just done two flatbreads for the cost. Did I mention the dough is super yummy! My husband and I split the margarita. We always test a new place to see if they can do simple well. It was delicious. Seating fills up fast on a busy night, but also have take away. We can't wait to come back on our next trip to Knoxville. We would be regulars if we lived there."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Emily E.,"Williamsburg, VA",10/13/2019,5.0,"A Dopo is the best restaurant in Knoxville. When you go, I recommend you force everyone at your table to order something different. Just you and one other person? One person get a red sauce pizza and one get a white sauce pizza. Never forget to check out the special pizza, some of the best meals I have had here were the specials! Great wine list!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,John L.,"San Diego, CA",11/27/2019,5.0,Amazing quality. Italian style pizza with and Italian oven. They know what they're doing. Highly recommend. Feels like you're in Italy eating there.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Tiara B.,"Atlanta, GA",8/8/2018,5.0,"Amazing pizza. First off I really like the design of the building. Very trendy and youthful interior. It's a small place so I can imagine it getting packed on certain days. But the pizza, YASSSS chile. So I got the 'Nduja & Mushrooms pizza. 'Nduja is a spicy ground sausage. I also added sopressata salami. The base is white and it also came with mushrooms of course and I think what may have been artichokes? It has a really well balanced, savory flavor with a teeny weeny bit of spice (I like SUPER hot food so it takes a lot for me to call something spicy.) They also cook the pizza in a traditional fire oven, so it has that nice crisp yet soft crust. It reminds me much of Antico's in Atlanta. Great experience and food!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,David S.,"Bethesda, MD",11/5/2018,5.0,"This is a special place.  I was on a short visit to Knoxville which has lots of interesting restaurants and brew pubs, but I was intrigued by the opportunity to try a sourdough pizza.  The wine list also looked much better than average for a pizza place.  Lots of Italian wines that would work well with pizzas and salads.  The menu was not the predictable choices and featured lots of specialty meats made on the premises.  The wait staff was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and its ingredients as well as the wine selection.  The place is roomy with high ceilings which kept the noise level way down, making quiet conversation possible.  A Dopo provided me with an excellent dinner and a very pleasant evening.  Locals should be proud to have such a place and visitors should make a point of trying it."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Matt B.,"Knoxville, TN",11/4/2018,5.0,This is the best Pizza I've ever had!! The spicy greens pie was so amazing! Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Rosemary G.,"Windsor, CO",9/9/2019,5.0,"I had the gorgonzola pizza with local honey added and it was a real treat. My friends and I each ordered our own pizzas (which were all awesome) and then shared a margherita pizza as our baseline. We also shared a few carafes of wine and our checks were quite reasonable. The wait was pretty long and the noise level is pretty high, but I will definitely be back."

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Danielle L.,"Columbia, MO",9/5/2019,5.0,"I had an amazing experience at A Dopo! The service was prompt, polite, and very thoughtful. I mentioned being new to the area when looking at the local beer list - and she proceeded to walk me through their entire menu. I ordered a pizza, which was a large serving for one person, but I couldn't dare waste that delicious meal! Their in house nduja was a great pizza topping. I finished off my meal with gelato- because, why not?? Vanilla with dark chocolate shavings was the perfect end to a local meal."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ty B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/20/2018,4.0,"A very well run restaurant, with great waiters and waitresses, the only thing I have against it is the pizza wasn't really what I like, I am more used to more southern style pizza than more of a fancy one. Nevertheless I would still go back and encourage people to go try it!"

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ethan K.,"Lakewood, NY",8/11/2018,5.0,"Hands down best pizza in Knoxville. Wonderful, authentic Italian ingredients, great atmosphere, and awesome gelato.

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Steven J.,"Powell, TN",3/18/2017,3.0,"Trendy place, not many options and a bit pricey. For having so many local brewery options, there were not that many options available on draft. We asked for more basil on our marguerita pizza and thankfully the waitress brought us several leaves to add to our two leaves on our pie."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dana M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/22/2019,5.0,Always good. Always. Wonderful servers. Pizzacletta is the best thing ever! Great atmosphere too!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Scott K.,"El Paso, TX",3/26/2018,5.0,"Creative wood-fired pizza, local craft beers and homemade gelato. Top that off with great friendly service and you've got a winning combo. Oh and a bottle of sparkling (or flat) water for the table. Only thing I didn't like is the noise in the place which is a result of the industrial architecture of the place. Oh well."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Alyse W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/8/2017,5.0,"I love this place!! At one point I found myself going nearly every weekend!! I recommend the pizza with salami on it and I add the sweet hot sauce!! So. Good. getting a side of olive oil to dip your crust in is a great idea too. I'm usually stuffed after the pizza so I've only gotten the gelato once, but the pistachio was amazing!! Love that it has wine on tap as well!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Peter Z.,"Bellingham, WA",4/2/2017,4.0,"This spot should do well. A little on the pricey side but a well constructed menu with some really interesting creations. We split a salad and a pizza which ended up being just enough for the two of us being pretty hungry, as well as a bit of gelato to finish the meal off."

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Tom W.,"Aix-en-Provence, France",11/18/2017,5.0,I'm going back tonight to see if this Pizzecleta lives up to the last one which was the best pizza of my life.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ian G.,"Knoxville, TN",8/14/2017,5.0,"I'm going to give this eclectic pizza joint 5 stars because I get what they're trying to achieve and I believe they're doing a good job in order to reach that goal. This is very thin sour dough crust,  wood fired pizza cooked at a very high temperature with organic, upscale ingredients.The flavors on the pizzas were very good. Now for my particular taste when it comes to pizza I probably prefer a crust that's thicker and toppings that are more substantial/generous. My wife and I shared 2 pizzas at $16 and $18 per pie and honestly we left the restaurant not feeling like we ate very much food. The restaurant is clean, well lit, not too noisy, clean bathrooms and good service. But to be candid I really didn't see double the price for almost the same wood fired type pizza that i could buy at whole foods with more substantial toppings and sit in a similar industrial looking venue with similar somewhat uncomfortable tables and chairs."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Michael F.,"Clinton, TN",10/30/2016,5.0,This is real deal Italian pizza.  You can tell the dough has been given time to develop flavor. Cooked at very high temperature in a real wood fired brick oven. And the concept of  less is more when it comes to sauce and toppings.  It works because they are high quality cured meats and fresh ingredients. We tried 3 different pizzas and you can taste it in each one.    Our waitress talked us into trying the Gelato and we were glad she did.  Just phenomenal flavors. Add great service and atmosphere and this place is a home run.  Well done A Dopo. We will definitely be back.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ashley C.,"Knoxville, TN",6/28/2019,5.0,"Our absolute FAVE!! Never had anything I didn't like there, but the spicy greens is my go-to every time and the salads are like a fresh explosion!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,G M.,"Knoxville, TN",10/1/2016,5.0,"We are very excited to have awesome wood fired sourdough pizza in downtown! I had the beet root pizza, which was excellent and definitely not something one finds everywhere. My wife had the margherita and it was as authentic and tasty as the one we had at one of the best pizza places in Rome (Giacomellis). The mozzarella was handmade and delicious, and the sauce had great flavor. We will be back!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Carlie S.,"Nashville, TN",6/24/2019,5.0,Best pizza in Knoxville by far! Super cute & intimate. The food is incredibly fresh and delicious.

a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Brian A.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/13/2019,5.0,Very good sourdough wood fired pizzas. Traditional Italian . Includes some local sourced food. Service is good. Can be pretty busy. Use the Nowait app. Arugula and farm egg
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Brittany W.,"Cincinnati, OH",5/6/2017,5.0,Amazing. We stopped on our way home from vacation and it was expedient and delicious. Much needed after being in the car all day. The beetroot salad was so good I ordered another salad promptly after! Our pizza was perfectly topped with sauce and cheese and drizzled with olive oil- mouth watering! Highly recommend and jealous this isn't in my hometown.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Nicole J.,"Louisville, TN",10/27/2016,1.0,"I really wanted to like A Dopo.  The idea of a unique pizza place in such a cool part of town, walking distance from Public House and Crafy Bastard Brewery, sounded so great.  However, my first experience at A Dopo was not great.  While I understand the 2 hour wait on opening weekend, I mean it gave us a chance to walk to Crafty Bastard so no complaining there, the pizza itself was lackluster.  The crust was really good but the majority of my ""pizza"" was crust.  I think the actual pizza was maybe 12"" in diameter, but the sauce (the white pizza with prosciutto) only covered MAYBE a 4"" diameter of the pizza.  I get that it was late, and I get that it was opening weekend and I get that it was crazy busy, but when I wait for 2 hours, patiently, and am really excited to eat at this really cool new pizza place, I expect the pizza sauce to cover the pizza.  What portion of the pizza that did have sauce was good, but I didn't go there to only eat a bunch of pizza crust. On a side note, the wine and the sparkling water were great!  I love that A Dopo offers sparkling water and wine on tap. Very cool.I really like the atmosphere but, it was quite noisy so the Hubs and I had a hard time hearing each other talk."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Tara S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/26/2016,5.0,"Everything is delicious. Salads, pizza, gelato all fantastic. The margarita, sopressetta and pizacletta were favorites. Be sure to order a little side of Calabrian chiles! They are fantastic on the pizzacletta! Wine bottles are a good value with many interesting options. The gelato is creamier than it looks and perfect little portion. For 3 people, 2 pizzas is perfect when splitting a salad as well. So nice I had to go twice in one week!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Andrew O.,"New York, NY",1/8/2017,5.0,What a great new restaurant to add to the list! Had dinner here for the first time tonight and will definitely be back. They really have something special here with the sourdough crust recipe. The toppings and sauce are great as well. Another big plus is having Blackberry Farm beers on tap. Hope to get back here as soon as possible. Keep up the great work!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Tim E.,"Uptown, Charlotte, NC",7/3/2017,5.0,"Wow. This spot truly blew me away. Would plan to come here anytime I am in Knoxville. Fantastic pizza's with great ingredients. The menu suggests one pizza per person, but one would have to be very hungry to finish one pizza by themselves. Really good salads. The gelato is amazing. We had Pistachio and Mixed Berry. Very small seating area, so No Wait app is valuable to use. The crust does not have a very strong sourdough taste, which slightly bummed me, but should make people who don't love sourdough a little more comfortable with giving it a try."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Allison C.,"New York, NY",8/12/2017,5.0,"This place has the BEST bread ever. Every ingredient was so fresh, the gelato was life changing, and I finally got to have frosé. We will definitely be back!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Linda F.,"Concord, TN",2/23/2019,5.0,"Awesome service, delicious and creative pizza and the homemade gelato is the best in Knoxville. Atmosphere has a great vibe too."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jodi W.,"Castleton, Castleton, IN",5/12/2019,5.0,Fabulous!  First time in Knoxville and stumbled on this restaurant. Food was delicious and atmosphere was fun and employees were all wonderful!  Hope to visit again soon!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Lucy B.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",12/12/2018,5.0,"Excellent experience all the way around. Simple design and atmosphere but that's because the focus is on the food. Service is good, drink choices and menu is carefully crafted and you won't go wrong with the pizza special. My husband wasn't into the special sausage, he liked the spice but the complaint was it was too 'meaty tasting, like it was pan fried in grease' he ate it and will try something else next time. It's worth a visit even if you're in a questionable side of town."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jennie H.,"Knoxville, TN",11/11/2016,4.0,This was so good! Top quality sourdough and excellent pizza ingredients. The restaurant is new and hot so long wait and service a bit slow but SUPER friendly once they got to us.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jp C.,"Birmingham, AL",5/24/2017,5.0,Love that pizza and the gelato!!!  Love the casual setting for lunch.  They also have good coffee and cappuccinos!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Eaterx K.,"Knoxville, TN",7/20/2017,5.0,"They've worked out the kinks, and this pizza and flavor combinations are so tasty and unique! I know it's a pizza joint, but get a salad to go with your pizza, so fresh and flavors on every level"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Eaterx K.,"Knoxville, TN",12/11/2016,3.0,"Likes.........open kitchen and custom wood-fired pizza oven, location with ample parking and close to nearby breweries/venues. Dislikes.......Pizza sauce, cheese,and toppings were mainly in the center of the pie. This left a very wide rear crust and I can eat pizza crusts anywhere. Also I did not detect a ""sourdough"" taste that I thought I would and the dough overall for me lacks salt. I need to revisit since we ate here during the first two weeks they were open. Perhaps the sauce and cheese go a little further out towards the edge and the dough starter has a little more salt added to the bulk."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jeffrey D.,"Knoxville, TN",4/2/2019,4.0,They do a great job with their pizza. We try and take the family once a month on Sunday Fundays
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Deb T.,"Knoxville, TN",5/13/2017,5.0,"This is my new favorite pizza! Great new combinations for this area. We were with a large group, so we shared four pizzas and four gelatos. The gelato was creamy and delicious. The service was great in spite of the packed house. Get there early to avoid a wait. We'll be back!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Ken R.,"Walton Hills, OH",3/19/2017,5.0,Fantastic brick oven pizza and outstanding service. Table beer selection is a real plus
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kate B.,"Seattle, WA",6/4/2017,5.0,"Writing my first ever yelp review because this place is just that good. We had the special pizza which was being done with poached lemon and was incredible. Also ordered a classic margarita -- a perfect Neapolitan pie with a subtle kick from the sourdough. Ended the night with some frosé, which was a fun and refreshing as you can imagine. Overall a wonderful meal with amazing service throughout."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jacob C.,"Lenoir City, TN",1/13/2019,5.0,This is our favorite pizza place in Knoxville! Their specials are amazing and fairly priced. The service is great and they come with good recommendations and knowledge of the menu. Highly recommend! We make a point to come into Knoxville and hit this place often!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Victor K.,"Chicago, IL",11/18/2018,4.0,Easly the best pizza in Knoxville.The stuff they use is 100% authentic in making the pies. Tried 3 different pies 2 red sauce and 1 white. Red takes the crown here. Crust is chewy at the rim and thin and a little crispy in center. Cool space and solid service. Waiting is a drag.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jo S.,"Nashville, TN",8/10/2017,5.0,"Very delicious, simple pizza. Clean restaurant, bathrooms. Food came fast, good portions. I spilled my beer, and the owner helped clean up and got me another free. Coming back!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Josh M.,"Knoxville, TN",2/24/2019,1.0,"Atmosphere was good, service was good, the food was terrible. Some of the smallest portions for the biggest price I've ever seen. Will definitely never return."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Katie M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",7/27/2018,5.0,"Really amazing experience. The salads are so good. The pizza is amazing. The wine glasses are cheap and delicious. Make sure you save room for gelato. I will caution you to make a reservation. They're a bit weird in terms of you'll arrive and there will be plenty of open tables but they will insist on making you wait. Whatever, it's worth it. The waitstaff is very courteous as well. Really wish I could have pizza like this all the time."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Drew W.,"Knoxville, TN",7/7/2017,3.0,"A Dopo is a nice place.  I have no strong complaints but not strong loves either, hence my 3 stars.  The Crust and pizza overall are good, but it didn't leave me with a strong need to return.  I would not deter anyone from trying it if you are looking for this atmosphere and style.  The price did not deter me from trying, but it will probably not be worth many return visits for me.  Knoxville has some good other options.  Noise can be a little high when full, and not speediest of service, but Very polite, nice, and helpful.  Enjoy a visit, but don't go in with over expectations"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Lynne C.,"Knoxville, TN",3/1/2017,5.0,"Thank goodness knoxville food scene is finally progressing beyond the chain restaurants. Local should be your first choice, you won't be disappointed here. Perfectly baked pizzas, not your typical toppings, which make it perfect For us foodies. Get there early when doors open. They take great pride in what they do!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Seth K.,"Knoxville, TN",2/18/2017,5.0,"One of my favorite pizza restaurants anywhere.  Great service, good selection of beer and wine, and unique pizza you won't get anywhere else in Knoxville.   Make sure to save room for the Gelato."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Charley B.,"Atlanta, GA",1/21/2017,5.0,Best pizza in Knox!!!!!!!! Right near downtown this is a great place to check out.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,John G.,"Knoxville, TN",1/2/2017,5.0,My favorite new pizza place. Incredible tasting pizza. Fresh ingredients. Great wait staff. I will return very soon.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Cindy M.,"Huntsville, AL",4/8/2017,5.0,"This is my favorite pizza place!! Love the food, atmosphere, and the customer service is exceptional! Advise getting the gelato it is amazing!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Amanda B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/11/2016,5.0,"We love pizza, especially wood-fired pizza. A Dopo was fabulous! I had The Pizzicelettia which is a white pizza with prosciutto and arugula. It was delicious! The hubby had a traditional Margherita. It was also delicious. The crust was crispy; just the way I like it. My favorite part was probably the pistachio gelato. It. Was. So. Good. The restaurant is very small and simple. We had about a 25 minute wait. We were able to walk across the street to The Public House for a drink. They texted us when our table was ready. Very friendly staff and great service!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,George S.,"Knoxville, TN",10/25/2018,5.0,"A taste of Italy in Knoxville. Delicious, creative toppings on red, white and veggie pizza cooked in a wood fired oven. Local products add to the freshness. Friendly, hard working, helpful staff add to the experience. Don't forget to try the mozzarella with spicy oil or to end with the creamy gelato."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Madelyn W.,"North Augusta, SC",5/21/2018,5.0,"hands down, my favorite meal in Knoxville. literally nothing better than the simple, well dressed verde salad and a pizza. this place sources locally from surrounding gardens and the farmers market and the quality is consistent and incredible every time. closest experience to when I lived in Italy and I love it. there is limited seating and always a wait so I suggest getting on the No Wait app before you even think about heading that way - but if you have a wait Public House across the street is a cool place to grab a drink and sit on the back patio until you get seated and experience the best pizza of your life."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kelly S.,"Louisville, TN",3/16/2018,5.0,"An unforgettable spot to eat. Great, unique pizza with the best salad I've ever had topped off with gelato! This place is a real treat."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Sonny S.,"Rockwood, TN",9/19/2018,5.0,"I really loved A Dopo Sourdough Pizza.  The location is cool!  The waitress was very nice, helpful and friendly.  The atmosphere was great and the food was very fresh, different in a good way and healthy.  The only thing that was wrong with it, was that the noise was too loud.  It was sometimes annoying."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Oliver P.,"Murfreesboro, TN",12/23/2017,5.0,"Love the vibe, loved the food, even the white pizza which I wasn't expecting. My favorite pizza ended up being the white one with mushrooms and I don't even really like mushrooms"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Matt E.,"Cambridge, MA",1/20/2018,5.0,This is probably the best pizza in Knoxville.  The white pizza with kale on it is delicious.  Great service as well.
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Peggy H.,"Knoxville, TN",4/8/2017,5.0,"i love this place. sweet people, such amazing pizza- try the beetroot or spicy greens. salads are always freaking amazing. lovely experience always."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Chris K.,"Knoxville, TN",4/7/2018,5.0,Visited with a small party of 8 staff was very accommodating and hospitable. Order was taken quickly and delivered even quicker including custom fresh cut pizza toppings.  Offers drought beer from nearby local craft brewery.  Would highly recommend and hope to visit again soon!
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Whitney G.,"Charlotte, NC",1/16/2017,5.0,"De-friggin-licious. This pizza is so good, 5 stars all the way, nothing more to say,  just go and eat for yourself"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jamie M.,"Columbus, OH",6/3/2017,5.0,"Easily the best pizza in Knoxville and some of the best pizza I've had anywhere actually. I've had the ""best"" woodfired pizza in Nashville, Atlanta, Chicago but A Dopo actually beats the za at these other places. We tried the Ruchetta and the nduja and mushroom pizza. The red Ruchetta pizza was good and you can taste the quality in the pizza. It was a unanimous decision that the white nudja and mushroom pizza was better. The mushrooms added so much flavor to the pizza and everything about it was amazing. We also tried some gelato which was good but nothing amazing. We tried the stracciatella (chocolate chip) gelato. They sold out of the pistachio gelato, so I will reserve my ultimate judgement of the gelato until I can try that flavor. Be prepared to wait however. The restaurant is small and they don't have a bar to sit at in the meantime, which I think hurts them because we walked over to another bar while we waited. Ultimately, if you live in Knoxville or are traveling through and want some pizza A Dopo is a must-try."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Jo S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2017,5.0,"Our last visit here made me really appreciate this business. We were in the mood for pizza & initially we chose Barleys. We waited30 min for a table, but that's not the restaurants fault. It was bizarre considering there were several tables empty & lots of servers standing around, but I'll stay on point. After we're were sat, we waited 10 minutes for our server to take drink orders. 30 minutes later there wasn't a water glass in sight. We told the server we were leaving & went to Dopo. We immediately got a table, and had both sparkling & still water within a couple of minutes. Our server was friendly, attentive & knowledgeable about the menu. I got the margarita pizza with sweet hot. The crust is crispy but also chewy. The sauce is the perfect amount & blends well with the peppers & honey of the sweet hot. Husband got the marinara with sweet hot & mushrooms. He has been avoiding cheese & it was the perfect meal. After pizza, I moved on to the espresso gelato. The portion size is just big enough to leave you satisfied but not stuffed. Every time we've been to Dopo, the service has been outstanding. I suggest getting in line on the no wait app before you arrive if there is a wait."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Hannah K.,"Cedar Park, TX",5/10/2017,4.0,"I really liked my marinara pizza. It did not make me feel bloated like pizza usually does. I LOVED the sauce! I enjoyed the taste, and may have loved the absence of a pizza hangover even better. The service could have been a little better, and I wished my crust wasn't as baked as it was. Maybe 2 minutes less. Either way, good pizza. May have to go every once in a while because it's slightly pricey for me."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Teresa M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/19/2017,5.0,"It was really, really good!  At first glance the menu just doesnt seem all that varied or impressive, but i was wrong!  The crust was fabulous, toppings great and adding honey etc tho weird sounding, were great!  Apparently word is out!  We got there at 5:30, and tables were filled by 6 with some waiting by 6:45!  You gotta go!!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Janet P.,"Knoxville, TN",7/20/2017,5.0,"This is quickly turning into my favorite pizza in town. I highly recommend any thing with the white sauce and the nduja. The service and atmosphere are great. Amanda is our favorite person there, always friendly."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Abraham B.,"Westwood, MA",12/11/2016,5.0,"Great pizza. Best in Knoxville by far if you like wood fired pizza and as good as any we have had up north in NY and NJ. The urban style decor and friendliness of the staff provides a nice complement to the food. As an aside, be sure to try the gelato."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Kris M.,"Knoxville, TN",12/11/2016,4.0,"Been meaning to write this for a while. I visited the first week of opening and even though not everything was perfect, I thought it was great. You could tell the staff and owners were busting their butts. I enjoyed the pizza very much. Can't wait to go back and give it another shot."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Dude G.,"Morgantown, WV",12/8/2016,5.0,"The pizza is freakin' delicious. I had the special which was a white sauce variety. It had their spicy sausage, pickled green tomatoes, and mint (yes mint!). I was a bit skeptical, but it came together great. That is really saying something because I am usually a straight up pepperoni kinda guy (which I also tried and it was also perfect).  I also had a side of the Calibrian peppers just by themselves since someone else posted they really liked them. That was really the icing on the cake. I've since bought my own batch of those.The crust is good enough to eat by itself.  Also, from what I understood, they make as much of their own ingredients as they can within the restraints of practicality. The menu says one pizza per person is the recommended portion, but if you were to split a salad one pizza can easily feed two people especially if you have some of their delicious Gelato. Considering the quality of the ingredients and how good it is, the price is more than reasonable. It's a great place to take a date if you're looking to impress by finding a local ""off the beaten path"" kinda place with great food. The atmosphere is also great. Very mixed crowd. They also serve local craft brews which they change up frequently as I understood it. I don't drink so I can't comment on those. The proprietor is also a cool guy. He was in the back making the pizza and would occasionally come around to talk to the guests. All in all a very unique place with hands down the best pizza in town."
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Chris S.,"Cordova, TN",11/7/2016,5.0,"A dopo is a place to enjoy community and fantastic pizza! Every time I go in I am greeted with a smile or a familiar face! This little pizzeria brings the family to a restaurant atmosphere, by making you feel like you belong! I can't say enough about the pizza too! The pizzacletta is my personal favorite, but also try the special(which rotates every night)! Overall Knoxville has a new pizzeria that everyone should try out and continue to be apart of, because I know I will!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Steve W.,"Knoxville, TN",10/27/2016,5.0,"This place is amazing!!!  Had the ""spicy greens"" pizza Bianca and the insulata di grano. Both were incredible. Topped it off with pistachio gelato and amarena cherry gelato. Best meal I have had in a long time!!"
a-dopo-sourdough-pizza-knoxville,Uni P.,"Knoxville, TN",3/9/2017,3.0,"It's a really attractive building and nice inside. We ordered the mushroom cashew or some kind of nut variety dip with focaccia bread as our appetizer. We were a little disappointed to find that the focaccia bread was not freshly baked but cold and a little hard when our app arrived as they are a pizza place with a giant oven for dough. The dip was good but really really tiny like in a container for a side of mustard. They garnished with picked veggies and again there were a few slivers of onions and things but would have been nice to have a little more...this coming from a person who usually doesn't like it when restaurants serve gigantic, crazy portions just to fill up a plate. We got the veggie pizza with beets and blue cheese and the sopressata pizza.  The latter was delicious but I credit the cured sopressata itself. Th dough had a slight sour taste for sure but I was ambivalent about the whole sour dough concept. I wish the pizza hadn't been so soggy. Overall, beautiful inside and always nice to see new, local restaurants in Knoxville.  I wasn't crazy about the food."
osteria-stella-knoxville,A S.,"San Francisco, CA",4/2/2022,5.0,"Amazing!! We had our first visit Friday evening and Osteria Stella DID NOT disappoint! We are new to the area and are LOVING the food scene out here.  Knoxville is reminiscent of what our home (west coast) used to be. Our server, Chris was fantastic. At one point, he  asked a pan handler to leave the patio where we were dining. He heroically smoothed over what might have a potentially soured an otherwise perfect evening. It was a little chilly that evening and he made that sure everyone on the patio was comfortable. Chris's knowledge of the menu was superb. His suggestions were excellent and when we asked about wine pairings, he called over the sommelier who gave EXCELLENT recommendations. Everything was VERY, VERY good. The food was delicious and delightful. The Tiramisu was by far the creaminest I have ever had. Our dining experience was definitely worth it. I have seen some of the other reviews.. if you want a DINING experience, this is THE place for you. If want to eat to the point to where you need to loosen your belt and take an antacid, the Olive Garden might be a better choice. I highly recommend this establishment, 5 stars easily!"
osteria-stella-knoxville,Lynn C.,"TN, TN",5/25/2022,5.0,"Met up with a friend for dinner as it's half way between for both of us. I had to pay $10 to park, but it was worth it. There is a lot right across the street.  We sat outside on the patio, very cute and it was a beautiful evening.  Our server Kyle was very friendly, knowledgeable about the cocktail and food menus and made excellent recommendations.  I had the Hugo cocktail and my friend had a frozen strawberry And Prosecco cocktail. They were so good and refreshing we each had two!  I ordered the gnocchi with sage butter. It was the perfect portion and the flavors were spot on.  House made gnocchi was excellent consistency.  We even ordered dessert!  I had the Tiramisu and my friend Heidi mocha almond cannoli.  Yum!! Nice location, lots of foot traffic walking by the patio."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Michael S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/3/2021,3.0,"Good place but won't return.Looking back on this experience, I wish I would have researched more about the place ahead of time and reset my expectations.I had heard Osteria Stella was hard to get into - and that you have to make a reservation weeks in advance. I don't know what I want to have for dinner tonight much less a few weeks from now (ha!). However - a couple of friends had some extra room in their reservation (a couple backed out) - so I was spontaneously able to go with my partner one Friday night.Great wine selection. We tried to order an appetizer to start, and we were told that due to limited kitchen capacity the server needed to put the entire order in at the same time. That seemed odd to me since every other kitchen in the US had figured out how to take an appetizer order before an entrée order.Place was a little pricey. Which is fine, I don't mind paying a premium for a good meal. However, the portion sizes were small. I got the risotto con pollo e funghi (risotto with chicken and mushrooms) and nearly laughed out loud over the minuscule pieces of chicken. It tasted decent, but nothing spectacular. My partner got the Lasagna. We were both still hungry after the meal.The way the menu is structured I assume they want you to order something off the Primi section and the Secondi section plus an antipasti or the like - which would be about $60.My final thought as I walked out was this place must be making BANK. I mean pasta is inexpensive to make. Yes, I get that they make it in house and import ingredients and on and on - but if pasta wasn't cheap to produce you couldn't get it for a dollar a pound at the grocery store.I realize that I'm not their ideal client. When I think of a ""good"" (i.e., expensive) meal I think of a nice steak dinner. If I want to pay $30-60 a plate plus alcohol for dinner, I'll go to a steakhouse - not for risotto.Again, fine place. Good food. Just not for me, especially with other places like Emilia so close by."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Olivia N.,"San Francisco, CA",8/9/2022,5.0,I went for my birthday last year and again for an anniversary dinner this year. One of the best in Knox
osteria-stella-knoxville,Mai L.,"Denver, CO",9/12/2021,5.0,"This place is very romantic and date night-esque but I came with a co-worker. We were sat in a small booth and out server was over to grab water and get our drink order. We inquired about the menu and he told us that even though the pastas are basic - they are all made in house and very good. He suggested a couple and they ended up being what we got. We also ordered some bread and olive oil. The plates they have are very cute. And he was right - everything was great. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the cacio e Pepe was the perfect creamy and peppery. The tomato sauce pasta we got was also very good and the sauce was flavored well. Again, two very basics but made so delicious. I cannot wait to come again!"
osteria-stella-knoxville,Bonnie L.,"Knoxville, TN",2/5/2022,3.0,"It is in old town across from the train station. Be prepared to walk or pay a pretty penny for parking. When you walk in there is a set of doors for Brother Wolf (their bar) and then Osteria Stella. You definitely want to make a reservation ( I did it online super easy) as the dinning room is small. We got right in to our table with no wait which was great. The restaurant itself is pretty dimly lit (fitting the decor) but they have these cute little lamps on the table that you can change the lighting to see the menu easily. They have a nice Italian wine list and quite a few fun cocktails list as well. We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc 2020, 'Venezia Giulia IGT' CLIC, FrIuli which was very good. Beers were limited to really only Italian ones so unless you like Peroni plans to drink a cocktail or wine. Matt was our server and very helpful, explained the menu well and was great about asking about allergies or dislikes to help advise. Even let the chef know of my allergy just in case even though I didn't order anything with it in. We started with the Mozzarella di Bufala which was wonderful (however I could've used a little more salt and pepper and oil cause I can't get enough) (forgot picture because it was gone before I remembered haha). My husband ordered the Gnocchi Burro e Salvia (butter, sage, parmigiana reggiano) very good and tender with great flavor, just very small portion. I ordered the Branzino (I did head off - skin on Mediterranean Seabass, cannellini beans, carrot, and pine nuts). Again great flavor but very small portion especially for sea bass. We don't typically order dessert but we were both still hungry lol so we both got the tiramisu and a White Russian for an after dinner drink. Dessert was good a lot of the lady fingers were actually dry which made the point of the dessert lacking. Matt was a great server and very attentive. I gave this 3 stars primarily because of the food portions to the cost and then the dessert. All in all we walked out just under $200 with tip. The flavors were great on the meals but they need to look at their portions a little more. We needed up ordering a pizza later that night since we were still hungry."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Erika M.,"Knoxville, TN",12/12/2021,5.0,"TL;DR: If you want excessively large portions, aren't interested in authentic Italian cuisine that isn't over seasoned, or if you're not up for the cultural experience of European eating, go to Olive Garden. Their all-you-can-eat breadsticks might be just what you're looking for. Before the pandemic, our last international travel was to northern Italy. We fell in love with the culture and, more importantly, the food. After seeing all of the accolades that Osteria Stella has been receiving on a national scale I was so excited to give this one a whirl. If you haven't heard yet, getting a table requires some planning so make sure you make your reservation well in advance. We snagged an 8:45 spot on a Saturday, which felt super European and appropriate. We headed downtown early to enjoy a drink before dinner and as we were finishing up we were pleasantly surprised to receive a text that our table was ready 30 minutes early. Upon our arrival, we were promptly seated and greeted by our server, Brad. He was amazing from start to finish. He was super knowledgeable about their menu, including the wine menu. He pointed out that Osteria Stella offers the largest Italian wine selection in the entire southeast. And it truly is extensive. The bottle that Brad helped us select was a little outside of what we would normally order, but it was delicious and paired well with each bite of our meal. My husband and I enjoy sharing meals so that we can try more menu items. We ordered from each of the sections of the menu except for an insalate (salad). The food was timed perfectly and we never felt rushed through the courses. The Arancino was delicious. The outside texture was perfectly crispy and the inside was filled with incredibly flavorful meat ragu and melted cheese. The topping of pickled onions was a brilliant addition to cut some of the richness of the flavors. Next up was the house bread. We ordered it intending to use it with sauce clean up through the meal. Here's the problem: the bread and olive oil was a surprise superstar. I know; we were just as surprised as you are reading this. The bread was airy with the perfectly salted crust. The real star here, though, was the olive oil. I forget sometimes how incredible high-quality olive oil is. It took everything in me to save some of the bread for later.My very favorite pasta is bucatini so it's a must-get when it's on a menu. Osteria Stella not only offers it but makes it in-house. Hello, bonus points! The sauce on the pasta we perfect, relying on the flavor from its high-quality ingredients rather than over-seasoning. The flavor of the guanciale really stood out (think pancetta, but better). The richness of the tomato-based sauce showed that they took their time cooking this one to perfection. Due to an error in the kitchen, we were gifted a plate of sea bass that was served with cannellini beans. Not a fish fan myself, I nommed on the beans while my husband enjoyed the fish. I was blown away by the intense flavor in the beans. So much so that I asked Brad how they were prepared. He described the process that involved brining anchovies. I found it pretty ironic that I loved them so much since I'm not a fish eater at all. I'm not typically one to order chicken in a restaurant, but based on what I'd read in other Yelp reviews, I took a chance. Our Pollo al Marsala arrived and was superb. It was cooked PERFECTLY. He enjoyed the thigh and I took to the breast. After my raving, he tried the breast and complimented that it was tender, moist, and flavorful. You will not be sorry if you order this! Last, but far from least, came dessert. I was torn between the panna cotta and the tiramisu. When I was in Italy, it was my mission to eat tiramisu every day. Literally every day. But a solid panna cotta (which is hard to find) is impossible to pass up. Brad ensured us that while their tiramisu is fantastic, it will always be available. He told us that if we were up for something different to try the panna cotta and I'm so glad we did. First of all, the panna cotta itself was rich, creamy, sweet (but not too sweet) and I would have been happy to eat it without a topping. But that topping tho! They are currently partnered with Beardsley Farms where they get some unique variety of orange that they brine in sugar and salt. They create some sort of magical gel that is salty and sweet and perfectly bitter. It's one of the most unique and delicious desserts that I've had in a really long time. Kudos to Osteria Stella. We are excited to come back!"
osteria-stella-knoxville,Bruce H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2022,5.0,Very good Italian specialties in service with subtle flavors and good service. Will definitely return in the future.
osteria-stella-knoxville,Kelly F.,"TN, TN",10/20/2021,5.0,"We quibbled over 4 or 5 stars for this place and decided on 5. The negatives that we had were far too small and trifling to remove a full star (once again I find myself wishing we could give 4.5). We found the evening in its entirety was delightful.The food was exquisite, from our first plates (especially the arancino. We've had it often at another Italian place we like much, and there was a clear difference of the two; frankly at the other place they are simpler but quantity is bigger. Here, they were exquisite with a more varied/refined taste, albeit smaller amount). The mozarella dish we thought was ok, although honestly neither of us are great fans of that cheese...we ordered it for the winter squash and greens and they were very tasty. We had gnocchi for our pasta and loved it...very tender, mouth-melting texture. Then finished with a delightful swordfish cooked just perfectly.Add to this some very tasty cocktails (I love negronis, so having variations of that great drink were really fun), a wonderful dessert (cannoli) and espresso...perfect evening!So why would I even consider 4 stars: let me mention my petty issues. One...the espresso had no lemon peel. I know that's not ""mandatory"" but in my world, it would be!!! Another....I never like it when places charge for bread (other than having some basic bread available then charging for special, or more). Especially with the DELICIOUS sauces; my bad for NOT ordering the bread....I recommend you do, and I sure will next time. Prices are high but well worth it for the exquisite fine tastes. Can't wait to go back with a larger group to try more dishes."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Molly F.,"TN, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,"Adore this spot. This restaurant is truly an experience in fine dining,  complete with a menu all Italian. The drinks are unique, light, and fresh. The food is full of flavor without ever being over the top, and the quality of ingredients is clear. The staff is friendly and helpful and we will come back time and time again to eat, drink, and  enjoy this space."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Rose K.,"San Diego, CA",4/22/2022,5.0,"This is the absolute best restaurant I have ever been to. My husband and I have been twice and continue looking for an excuse to return. The menus are intimidating and different than what we are used to, so both times we just asked our servers to choose for us. (Shout out to Savannah last night! I wish I remembered our first waiter's name!)Beverages I have tried: Negroni bianco: a fabulous gin cocktail that even gin haters will love. Erbaluce: a crisp and sweet white wine. Aglianico: a very smooth red wine, a little smoky, I would think it's a good red to introduce people to reds. Doesn't leave you with that weird red wine dry mouth.Espresso martini: JUST WOW. Montefalco Sagrantino Passito: Okay, this might not be for everyone. It's $30/glass. But if you enjoy fortified wines like port, you owe it to yourself to try it out. It blew our minds so much, we bought a second glass and then the entire bottle. Food we have tried:-The olives: we were given these complimentary on our first visit because our meal was taking a little long. They are meaty, buttery, and the perfect snack. -Mozzarella di Bufala con Zucca: super yummy buffalo mozzarella with what I think was butternut squash, the greens looked like arugula, and a really nice lemon vinaigrette. We would not have ordered this ordinarily, but we loved it so much we wanted to replicate it at home.-Gnocci Burro e Salvia: these amazing fluffy pillowy potatoey bits of heaven were incredible. They were swimming in a butter sage sauce and covered in Parmesan. -Lasagna: this was such a comforting dish. It just felt like love. -Arancino: Risotto and a meat/vegetable ragu, deep fried. WOAH. The flavors in this were incredible. Was there white wine in the rice? There was just layer after layer of beautiful flavors.I can't wait to come back!"

The interior is gorgeous and the place settings have so much attention to detail. The food was amazing and the wine list was phenomenal.

osteria-stella-knoxville,Taylor A.,"Knoxville, TN",7/24/2021,5.0,First time at Osteria Stella/brotherwolf and it did not disappoint! My friend and I only had drinks and small bites but it was still delicious! There was a long wait for an inside table at Osteria Stella so we decided to sit out on the patio-which had cocktails and limited food menu. We shared the Arancino appetizer and cacio e pepe pasta- both were delicious. Such a fun new addition to the old city- we will be back!
osteria-stella-knoxville,Lana B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/8/2021,5.0,"Enjoyed a sneak peek at this latest addition to the Old City restaurant scene. With adjoining bar Brother Wolf, Osteria Stella takes over the space formerly occupied by Rebel Kitchen. The space is completely transformed with a chic mix of decor, lots of soft florals, yet edgy and fun. While it was pretty and eye catching, it lacks some softness that could absorb some sound - it was packed and rather loud. There are three private booths tucked in the corners. And the outdoor seating looks directly out of Southern Europe!Great attention to details with touch-adjustable table lamps, a fun mix of silver flatware, bold yet fun table menus (no QR codes here) and an eclectic yet cohesive mix of glassware and tableware. The drink menu is massive, with cocktails, wine, beer, aperitif and digestif options - easily 5x as many options as food! Note that Brother Wolf has its own drink/food menu, being a little more casual and social. And the food! Delicious nod to all things authentically Italian. We were greeted table side by Amelia? who carefully explained a few dishes on the menu, helping us to select a variety of great tastes. Being the soft opening, we felt comfortable giving feedback as there were some opportunities to balance dishes, but overall, the plates were tasty, eye-appealing and right-sized. Our favorites were the Spritz (I can't recall which one - there's 3 on the drink menu and they all looked good!), the potato and octopus appetizer, the swordfish entree and the panna cotta dessert (the texture was silky smooth!). Our server Matt did an excellent job, answering questions and retrieving info when he didn't have it. We look forward to their regular hours (start mid July 2021) and hope to see the small menu refresh seasonally."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Josh B.,"Knoxville, TN",10/3/2021,3.0,"The gnocchi is a step away from just being buttered mash potatoes. Arancino was a bit dry. No real taste that truly impressed. The red sauce was very good. We had the meatballs and although overall good, they were a bit dry as well. We were told the mozzarella came from Italian milk for authenticity, but it wasn't a standout either. The Negroni I had wasn't nearly as good as the Susano spritz I had to follow it. We stopped ordering after the gnocchi mainly because the menu is not very descriptive and just looking at it I wasn't very impressed. Ambiance is great. Service was excellent. Love the vibe. Just very disappointed in the food. There are better option in the Old City."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Aaron P.,"Knoxville, TN",7/8/2022,1.0,"Want to have a over priced meal and terrible service? Well....you have come to the right place, if you want to sit for 30 minutes without service while you have no drinks or an app order then you have come to the right place.  I wish I had more hands to give this hack of a restaurant more thumbs down. Don't waste your time."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Mike I.,"Brooklyn, NY",4/20/2022,4.0,"Food was good and service was also very good.   Our waiter was great.  I really only had two gripes with this place, one is that you had to pay for your bread which I've barely ever seen before and two was my main meal really just came with the meat, no sides.  I ordered the veal and maybe it was my mistake for not thoroughly reading the menu but all that came out was a large piece of veal (which was delicious by the way) and like 10 pieces of lettuce.  Guess I was expecting something else with it not just a plate of meat lol but the food was very tasty though."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Hannah M.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",7/22/2022,1.0,"I came with high expectations because I love their bar Brother Wolf, but I won't be dining here again. It took an hour and a half to get out entrees only for the pasta to be so salty it was nearly inedible. The waitress barely checked on us, I think she forgot about us a few times because we were sitting on the patio. This is not the level of service I expect when I'm spending over a hundred dollars on dinner."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Michael S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/3/2021,3.0,"Good place but won't return.Looking back on this experience, I wish I would have researched more about the place ahead of time and reset my expectations.I had heard Osteria Stella was hard to get into - and that you have to make a reservation weeks in advance. I don't know what I want to have for dinner tonight much less a few weeks from now (ha!). However - a couple of friends had some extra room in their reservation (a couple backed out) - so I was spontaneously able to go with my partner one Friday night.Great wine selection. We tried to order an appetizer to start, and we were told that due to limited kitchen capacity the server needed to put the entire order in at the same time. That seemed odd to me since every other kitchen in the US had figured out how to take an appetizer order before an entrée order.Place was a little pricey. Which is fine, I don't mind paying a premium for a good meal. However, the portion sizes were small. I got the risotto con pollo e funghi (risotto with chicken and mushrooms) and nearly laughed out loud over the minuscule pieces of chicken. It tasted decent, but nothing spectacular. My partner got the Lasagna. We were both still hungry after the meal.The way the menu is structured I assume they want you to order something off the Primi section and the Secondi section plus an antipasti or the like - which would be about $60.My final thought as I walked out was this place must be making BANK. I mean pasta is inexpensive to make. Yes, I get that they make it in house and import ingredients and on and on - but if pasta wasn't cheap to produce you couldn't get it for a dollar a pound at the grocery store.I realize that I'm not their ideal client. When I think of a ""good"" (i.e., expensive) meal I think of a nice steak dinner. If I want to pay $30-60 a plate plus alcohol for dinner, I'll go to a steakhouse - not for risotto.Again, fine place. Good food. Just not for me, especially with other places like Emilia so close by."
osteria-stella-knoxville,Stephanie M.,"Chattanooga, TN",12/1/2021,5.0,Very delicious! This is not the over greasy over stated American Italian we are used to but thank goodness! The food was amazing! The wine selection is extensive. Will go there again!

My daughter had lasagna, which was very dry. I had risotto, which was a tiny plate of...watery rice. Seriously, I'd take normal rice that my wife makes over this any day. Even though it was a tiny plate, I only ate 1/3 of it. Even the tiramisu was dry. Ah! I just thought of a positive. The chicken marsala was excellent. Possibly the best I've ever had. Bumping this from 1 to 2 stars just for that. If you go, get that. Cocktails were decent. But this was my wife's birthday, and we made the wrong call here. Ridiculous $ too, which really stung. I feel guilty enough spending $$$ on a *good* meal (just did at Lonesome Dove across the street), but to spend it on a meal that we didn't like hurts."

osteria-stella-knoxville,Broc G.,"Knoxville, TN",10/2/2021,1.0,"Not a fan. The menu is intentionally exclusionary, with dishes most people haven't heard of (written in Italian, no less) and several Italian staples completely absent. And the prices match: it's rather expensive, especially for such small portioned dishes, many of which you're likely to be unfamiliar with and may not like. Furthermore, everyone we encountered, including one of the owners, was very self righteous and snobby. We didn't have any major problem like hair in the food or overtly aggressive staff, but from start to finish, we felt like we were overpaying to be in a very unwelcoming environment. As a resident of the Old City, we wish something else had moved into this space.Final complaint: why do you need valet parking (which blocks the two lane road) when there's literally a $2/hr parking lot DIRECTLY across the street? It's pretentious for no reason."

Don't rate a restaurant in a pandemic because YOU, a person who has the luxury of going out to eat, has been slightly inconvenienced. That said, this place is fantastic. The decor is super cute, staff friendly and helpful. The food - YUM. I got the gnocco frito which is like a mini charcuterie board with fried gnocchi - delicious. Nothing overly fancy, but I enjoyed it a lot. And I got the Bucatini with guanciale and tomato sauce for my entree. It was everything I could have hoped for. The guanciale definitely elevated an already amazing tomato sauce. If you are looking for real italian, give this place a shot.

The drink menu is massive, with cocktails, wine, beer, aperitif and digestif options - easily 5x as many options as food! Note that Brother Wolf has its own drink/food menu, being a little more casual and social. And the food! Delicious nod to all things authentically Italian. We were greeted table side by Amelia? who carefully explained a few dishes on the menu, helping us to select a variety of great tastes. Being the soft opening, we felt comfortable giving feedback as there were some opportunities to balance dishes, but overall, the plates were tasty, eye-appealing and right-sized. Our favorites were the Spritz (I can't recall which one - there's 3 on the drink menu and they all looked good!), the potato and octopus appetizer, the swordfish entree and the panna cotta dessert (the texture was silky smooth!). Our server Matt did an excellent job, answering questions and retrieving info when he didn't have it. We look forward to their regular hours (start mid July 2021) and hope to see the small menu refresh seasonally."
kefi-knoxville,Chelsea K.,"Cincinnati, OH",7/19/2022,5.0,"Was in Knoxville for work and after seeing the pictures of the Spicy Feta on here, I knew I needed to go.The inside of this place is beautiful and our server was incredible (I wish I remembered her name). My friend and I shared the Spicy Feta, Saganaki, and Octopodi. Everything was honestly so delicious and fresh. I would say the Saganaki is a must since it comes on fire table side, which is quite the experience. Our food was all equally delicious so I can't pick based on that.My friend and I had had dinner before coming here, or we definitely would have ordered more. This will definitely be at the top of my list for next time in Nashville!!"
kefi-knoxville,Max M.,"Johns Island, Charleston, SC",8/3/2022,4.0,"The food was absolutely outstanding for the five of us.  My taking one star off was due to the service by fast-talking Doug which was slow, and frankly rude at the end when he essentially dropped/threw our bill on the table without a word and walked away.  At the beginning, my wife and I were wanting a $54 dollar of Chardonnay from Israel (where we had traveled in April 2018) and Doug said that he had to check in the back to see if it was available.  Then it began with him returning and saying that the VP who sets up the drink selection via the on-table QR code put it on the list when the wine did not get delivered.  Yes, he blamed the VP and tried to kick him under the bus.  We selected, at Doug's suggestion, a ""$29"" bottle of French wine (the QR coded wine selection showed it was $34 which I pointed out, without Doug responding at all).  On the final bill, it was $28 and even so, it was a good, but not great, wine, but at that price, who would split hairs?Others at the table were ordering mixed drinks which took forever and a day, with Doug blaming the bar (see his pattern?).  Our appetizers were slow also, although a group of 6 or 8 that came in and were seated well after us and were at another close-by table were served fairly quickly.  Again, the blame:  This time the kitchen.Let's talk about something positive for our $247 bill (only tipped 15% for the obvious above reasons, and I routinely tip 20% and sometimes more ).  Yes, the food!  First, the chicken in this table-sharing food atmosphere of Greek and Italian.  Named  Kotopoulo (a Greek word for grilled chicken). Seemingly, it was deliciously marinated (wish that I knew with what) so well that the taste went all the way through the chicken breast, much less the drumstick, thigh, or wing. The skin was somewhat crisp and added to the enjoyment by all.  I really could have eaten this chicken dish all by myself with nothing else for dinner. Yes, that good.  We had started with the Pikilia which was to be shareable for the table, but the warmed over the grill pita pieces went quickly but the three spreads thus had to be eaten with a fork.  Not a good way to be served---more pita pieces, please.Doug had said that the theme was to share and the ""For The Table"" selections would be well split around the table.  Problem is that the Spiced Lamb Pie although delicious was small such that two tablespoons would be all that each of us 5 folks could ""share.""The ""Fig + Arugula Salata"" (salad, for those who like me speak only English was tasty and was not shown as ""For The Table"" but we did all have some delicious morsels of the arugula, goat cheese, mission figs, walnuts and more with a wonderfully tasty balsamic fig vinagrette. The food is quite good in this somewhat small restaurant with brick walls which makes the sound a bit loud for my ears.  The food would have me coming back, without question. Our server would be changed next time with someone who does not rattle off his statements like a fast talking used car salesman (no offense to honest car salesmen)."
kefi-knoxville,Wendy B.,"Memphis, TN",6/17/2022,5.0,"Kefi is by far the sexiest restaurant in Knoxville. Period.The Garides (large shrimp, garlic-butter sauce, smoky tomato, feta, grilled country bread) was definitely something I'd come back for. Our server was Doug, who took exceptional care of us. He was had the unique talent of being incredibly attentive without being too involved in our conversation. The decor at Keri was gorgeous (which you can't quite tell from the few photos I tried to snap on the DL) but the dark chocolate brown velvety interiors and fabrics contrasted with soft light and crystal shades definitely gave it a warm, romantic vibe in the booths. The open tables and bar area have a more cool, upscale, hipster vibe. Bring your date here. They'll say yes."
kefi-knoxville,Lindsay H.,"Knoxville, TN",6/6/2022,4.0,"Walk through the doors of this Old City spot and you will find unexpected shnazziness (totally a real word ;-) ). Similar to sister restaurant, Vida, there is an upscale elegance to the decor and seating. They always choose modern and glam motifs with dim lighting, that lends itself to fancy occasions and romantic date nights. Also similar is the family style/shared plates. We went for our anniversary and were given a booth that seems tucked away and intimate, even in a crowded restaurant. There are dividers between high-backed booths that block noise and make it seem like you're in your own world. I was admittedly most excited about the cocktail flight. Yes, please. You get your choice of any three cocktails on the regular or special menus. We ordered one seasonal specialty drink, Kamari Sunset, as well as an Old Fashioned and the 6 Island Punch. The Old Fashioned was good, but nothing unique. The 6 Island had honestly, very little flavor. The Kamari Sunset...WOW. One of the best drinks we've had in Knoxville. If we weren't going to The Vault for a drink before our show, we would have ordered a full size of this drink. Food-Hummus (with pita triangles and a flatbread crisp of some kind), Saganaki (the flaming cheese topped with fig), Kokinisto (short rib with feta polenta), and cauliflower (with hazelnuts and dried cherries). We would order the hummus and Saganaki again for sure. Both tasted amazing and the hummus was arguably the best we've eaten...and we are a hummus-loving household! Next time, we would come back for a cocktail flight and these apps again. We would pass on the shortrib and cauliflower. The short rib was good, but I was spoiled with more tender and flavorful short rib recently at Northshore Brasserie. The cauliflower was our least favorite item with it being undercooked and the hazelnuts seemingly out of place with the bite. The cherries were a nice addition and the vinaigrette unexpectedly sweet. Make reservations, get a cocktail flight, and pace yourself with ordering from the menu. We ordered drinks and apps and when we were done with those, ordered our entree and veggie. Glad we spread it out! Be prepared to spend a decent amount of money and I would recommend leaving kids at home to enjoy this spot. Cheers!"
kefi-knoxville,Anwesh D.,"Memphis, TN",6/15/2022,5.0,Perfect spot for a nice celebration! Went there for a birthday celebration and had the best time!!Nice ambiance with fantastic drinks. Prices are on the higher end but the quality of the food and freshness of ingredients justifies the price.The saganaki and baklava are absolute delectable. Everyone should get them!!The garides was also really good and would recommend. The lamb souvlaki was also solid but didn't impress as much as the rest.
kefi-knoxville,Brooke H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/14/2022,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants in Knoxville!  I consistently have a great experience at this upscale Greek restaurant in the downtown area.  The craft cocktails are exquisite!  I always get a cocktail flight so I can try a few different drinks.  You absolutely must try the flaming cheese.  They light it table side and it is so much fun.  I've tried the hummus, octopus, meatballs, and stuffed grape leaves.   I always get a reservation when I go here...it fills up fast. Show up hungry!!  You'll be stuffed silly when you leave."
kefi-knoxville,Anne T.,"Knoxville, TN",8/11/2022,1.0,"Highly disappointed for a restaurant that is rated 4.7 on Google and the $300 I spent - I did not get the dinning experience I expected. I have been wanted to support and try this restaurant for over a year when I decided to participate in their Mykonos event. I purchased two tickets for a five-course meal paired with Greek drinks for a special date night with my husband. First they tried to sit us with random people in a corner of the restaurant, you would think we would get a private table paying this much money for dinner. There was no mention of double seating in their advertising. Then they served us 30 minutes after the event started at 7PM. The food portions were ridiculous small and the quality of the food was terrible. The salad was literally a few leaves tossed with grapes cut in half, the jump lump crab cake was the size of a silver dollar, the chicken Marbella I asked the waiter to send back and I informed the manager because it was so disgusting I couldn't eat it. The chicken was supposed to be the main course it was just a chicken breast slathered in a tomato based sauce. They did not give me an alternative to eat so I took a loss on that meal. Then we were supposed to have a hazelnut praline semifredo for desert and instead of getting what I paid for we were served rizogalo rice custard that tasted like fancy oatmeal. The only thing good were their drinks. I honestly feel duped out of my money for a lackluster experience. I've attached photos to document the experience. I would like the opportunity to give them another try but honestly I think I deserve a refund. I'm pretty upset about the experience, they should be embarrassed to serve people that food."
kefi-knoxville,Molly F.,"TN, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,"This is my all time favorite place to eat in Knoxville. The service has always exceeded expectations, the food is phenomenal, and the cocktails are some of the best in the city (especially the flight option!) Perfect for date night, after work drinks, or a night out with friends."
kefi-knoxville,Alex G.,"Knoxville, TN",3/15/2022,5.0,Have gone now twice in a week. Super unique place for Knoxville. Awesome service. Very knowledgeable. We didn't know what we wanted and the waiter just asked us to trust him. Just kept bringing food and it was all incredible. Fun for a date night or with a group of friends.
kefi-knoxville,Rachel W.,"Knoxville, TN",5/14/2022,5.0,"We really enjoyed our visit. We went with a larger party so we got to try quite a few dishes. To start, we ordered the hummus with warm butter and toasted pine nuts. It was delicious and gone within minutes. We also ordered the bread basket with oils, which was just okay. The pita bread didn't soak up the oils like normal bread would have, so it was a bit messy to eat. I don't think I would order it again with so many other amazing items on the menu. To drink, we did a cocktail flight. The pomegranate gimlet was my favorite of the three. Then we got the chicken souvlaki dish as our main entre, and it did not disappoint! The chicken was incredible. We also got the Halloumi (greens, cheese, peaches, and strawberries) and the Greek salad. I loved the Halloumi and would order that again. All in all, this was a really incredible experience and we will definitely be back."
kefi-knoxville,David C.,"Knoxville, TN",5/30/2021,5.0,"What's not to love love love about this place! OMG, it is now among my top five favorite dining establishments.It is in a nondescript brick building from bygone days in Old Town Knoxville. Nothing on the outside could prepare us for what we stepped into. We stepped into a high-end restaurant. The atmosphere is romantically chique, dark walls hung with fabulous oil paintings, pendants over each booth, individual tables, small twinkle lights scattered about the ceiling, a round bar with comfy bar seats and a beautiful granite counter with streaks of natural purple. Our server's name was ""Sam"" and she was the best. She was attentive, but not overly. One of the specialties of this restaurant is their cocktails on tap. On tap? Yup. On tap. They mix all their featured cocktails each day and then pour them as ordered. One of the fun things to do is order their trio of cocktails. Out of the 24 or so cocktails on tap, you can order a flight of three of any kind. After pouring, the bartenders artfully garnish each drink with everything from umbrellas, tiny tiny clothes pins, dehydrated fruit, marigolds, orchids and such. They are so pretty, you almost don't want to drink them. But I did, and man oh man oh man, they are the bomb. My favorite is the Old Fashioned which has earned the title of Best Old Fashioned in Knoxville from foodies far and wide.Appetizers, entrees and desserts are intended to be shared. You don't have to share, but it makes for an extra special and memorable meal. We started with the hummus mixed with warm butter and roasted pine nuts as well as Saganoki which is kesseri cheese with fig and lemon, flamed table side. It is as theatrical as it is flavorsome. We then ordered Keftedes, beef meatballs with tahini sauce, Marinated Olives and Pikilia, a sampling of three spreads. Our final ""appetizer"" was Halloumi which is seared delicious halloumi cheese garnished with arugula, apricots, strawberries and a balsamic reduction. If your mouth is not watering by now, I give up.For our shared dinner entrees, we ordered Beef Fatayar, a ground beef, onion, tomato and parsley filling fried in a pastry dough, Kotopoulo which is roasted chicken, cooked to perfection and served with rice pilaf and sautéed almonds, Païdákia, succulently roasted lamb chops, grilled apricots with a cherry demi glacé and Octopodi, a delectably grilled octopus served with fava beans, rainbow chard and slow roasted tomatoes.And if that wasn't enough, for dessert we had Baklava, my personal favorite, which was a huge yummy serving of phyllo dough layered with cinnamon, honey and roasted pine nuts, a luscious Lemon Tart as well as a yummy caramel cheese cake with caramel sauce and caramel candied popcorn.And four hours later, our exquisite, epic evening came to an end. Whew!!! We'll definitely be back (in fact we're going back next month). I can't give enough props in my highest of recommends for this classy and deliciously fine dining establishment that deserves your attention and attendance."
kefi-knoxville,Bailey P.,"Knoxville, TN",1/4/2022,5.0,"What a turn around. We had great service (Shout out to our server Chris) . my cocktails were delicious, ESPECIALLY the fools gold, which I wasn't going to get but our server suggested it, it's life changing. The pita was warm, the hummus tasted fresh and was perfect. The falafel was really good, tho I do wish it would be served with a side of something, they're a little dry to eat on their own. I solved this problem by ordering more hummus. My partner enjoyed his cocktail, flaming cheese, and entree. I'm really glad we gave kefi a second chance, it was perfect for our date night"
kefi-knoxville,Bailey P.,"Knoxville, TN",9/21/2019,3.0,"My expectations for this place were extremely  high. We tried to get a table last weekend and it didn't happen, so I was so stoked to get a table last night. I started off with the cocktails, deciding to go for a flight. The 3 I selected were picture perfect and tasty. I got the hummus and baba ganoush, which was good but not great. My brother and husband got a cheese appetizer. They said the best thing about it was the spectacle of the flambe. I then ordered the falafel, and it was just ok. I've had better falafel elsewhere. The drinks may draw me back, but the food won't. My husband and brother said the same about their meals. The ambiance is really great though."
kefi-knoxville,Elizabeth K.,"Austin, TX",4/11/2022,5.0,"Holy cow!! This restaurant is SO DELICIOUS. Every single thing that touched our lips was freakin fantastic. I cannot recommend this place enough. I can see why it's a little tough to get a reservation , the ambiance, the service, the cocktails ON TAP!! We all got a flight of cocktails, beautifully garnished and tasted delicious.  The flaming cheese! The chicken and rice, WOW, I needed a moment after tasting it to close my eyes and relish. SO GOOD. My only complaint was the table wasn't big enough for all the food we ordered . And GET DESSERT, 100% worth it! This is definitely my new favorite restaurant in Knoxville and maybe everywhere."
kefi-knoxville,Akinchita K.,"Temecula, CA",12/20/2021,5.0,I came here with one of my friends on a Friday night. They were able to seat us quickly and got us drinks right away. It's a family-style restaurant so the portions are pretty large. The greek salad is phenomenal! We also ordered hummus and kebabs. They were all exceptional. Kefi is one of the best Mediterranean places I have tried in Knoxville. It is more of an adult place and I wouldn't recommend bringing kids.
kefi-knoxville,Jonathan G.,"Knoxville, TN",3/13/2022,5.0,"The place looks like it belongs in a high profile city when you walk in. The bar is gorgeous and the booths are so cozy, as if it's specificLly made for you and your girls to have drinks (which you should and possibly get the flight and order a painkiller if you like that piña colada taste). Now I'm not sure if I was just super hungry both times I came here, but the food was DELICIOUS. I'm part lebanese, so I grew up with similar foods, and it tasted so good. My family likes to start with the Baba Ghanoouj and it didn't dissapoint. I ordered the lamb chops and it was enough for me and my parents with a cheese mezze (any of them will do tbh) and a salad. I highly recommend. :)"
kefi-knoxville,Krishnan I.,"Smyrna, GA",7/11/2022,5.0,Nice place to dine. They serve one of the best cocktails in Knoxville. Must try if you are visiting downtown Knoxville.
kefi-knoxville,E R.,"Rockford, TN",6/27/2022,3.0,"Not the worse Greek food I've ever had but not the best either, expensive mixed drinks doesn't help on top of poor service, it's a 50/50 shot on all of it! For the money, I think there are better restaurants to experience, IMO"
kefi-knoxville,Shannon H.,"New York, NY",3/3/2022,1.0,"Great food, wonderful cocktails, worst service I've ever had--our server was at our table for maybe a total of 45 seconds the entire night. Never once even refilled water or asked if we wanted another drink from the bar. Our table also wasn't ready at the time of our reservation and once we were sat, it took over 10 minutes for our server to make it over to us. Luckily we knew what we wanted to order during her first visit because it was basically the last time we saw her until I got up to ask the host if she could bring us the bill. Will not be back."
kefi-knoxville,Trenton E.,"Austin, TX",4/11/2022,5.0,"First, let's chat about the ambiance. The unexpected simple swankiness of this place was a surprise. Knoxville certainly has a ""Main street America"" charm about it, but the juxtaposition of the unexpected interiors of Kefi against that old school charm was cool.Next, the service. We were fortunate enough to have been waited on by a lovey young lady named Jen. The day we went was apparently her first day, but she could have fooled us!   She was gracious, attentive (as was everyone else who attended to our table), and when tasked with helping us make food selections she did NOT disappoint!And finally, the food. THE FOOD!!  Jesus H. Christ, the food! Every single thing that came to our table was mind-blowingly delicious. And I am not spouting hyperbole. It really was one of the most memorable meals I've ever had. If you haven't figured it out by now, I highly recommend this place.  Make a reservation sooner rather than later...and let Jen order your food for you. :)"
kefi-knoxville,Taylor A.,"Knoxville, TN",7/24/2021,5.0,"I wish I could give Kefi 6 stars. What a gem of a restaurant. From the sultry ambiance to the beautiful cocktails to the delicious food, its amazing. Dining a Kefi is definitely an experience that you shouldn't miss. I love their extensive menu because every time I go I get to try something new. Recently I had the 3 dip appetizer which included the hummus, tzatziki and muhammara and I always add the crudité because they give you so much dip. For an appetizer we ordered the Garides, (large shrimp in a garlic butter sauce on a crostini) so so so delicious. For the table we ordered Kokinisto, (short ribs over polenta) and the Kotopoulo (roast chicken over rice pilaf), both of these dishes are full of layered flavors and serves 2-3 people easily. You also can't forget the extensive cocktail menu that has something for everyone and the presentation does not disappoint. My husband and I are already planning our next date night there! GO...more like RUN to Kefi!"
kefi-knoxville,Megan E.,"Knoxville, TN",8/24/2021,5.0,"Great food, great lighting. Please get the salad it's HUGE. Our waitress was lovely. 1000% would come again."
kefi-knoxville,Prudence T.,"Clearwater, FL",9/9/2021,5.0,"Came here with some friends and our kids... Not a place for kids FYI.  They were very nice about the kids.  Its more of a dark, adult atmosphere for a date night.The food was great.  We had kebabs, hummus, salad and most of the normal Mediterranean options, all were good.Definitely recommend for a nice quiet vibe."
kefi-knoxville,Emily M.,"Galveston, TX",3/30/2022,5.0,"Our first time eating here and it exceeded expectations! All of the dips we got in the sampler were great, but the spicy feta was best of all! The pastitsio was very rich and enough to feed a family. Great service & overall great food."
kefi-knoxville,Kelly F.,"TN, TN",6/21/2021,5.0,"MUST upgrade to 5 stars. Every visit here is a delight. I won't mention specific dishes because they are ALL SO GOOD. Love small plates (their's are not so small-- almost all items had at least 3 portions and most 4 or 5, so our 4-top group could easily all get good tastes). We had several small plates, 2 entrees (with great sides, BTW) and some delicious craft drinks. Service was mostly very strong and very affable, and it's pretty clear that they ALL help each other-- not one of those places where 3-4 waitpeople walk by your table on the way to theirs without glancing to see if anything is needed.LOVE this place (and sister restaurant Vida!)"
kefi-knoxville,Kelly F.,"TN, TN",7/30/2019,4.0,"(Note, I'm usually a tough grader-- four stars is increasingly rare for me).Having said that, I had to 'downgrade' Kefi despite some excellent food, due mainly to service.We came in early so it was not crowded at all. First appearance of waiter was a bit slow, and that trend continued at points throughout the meal. The waiter got one of our first mini-plates wrong (but later, comped it, I will say) There was a LONG break between our two final plate; I know that can be kitchen rather than wait-staff at fault, but it was still a fault in an otherwise wonderful meal. Very few 'check-backs' during the meal to see about refilling drinks, or how the food was, etc.But that food- mostly great. We especially loved the octopus (with a green, some potatos, fava beans and tiny peppery-tomatoes). Excellent and MUCH better taste/texture to the octopus than I expected. Also enjoyed the meatballs with tzatziki sauce. Stuffed grape leaves had really ""al-dente"" grape leaves which we both liked, compared to the soggy messes often served, and there were lots of pine nuts for a good crunch. Tabouli was the only dish that wasn't anything special, but hey it was good tabouli, so that's not so common around these parts!We'd gladly go again and hope to soon; the food is excellent. I thought the prices were very reasonable. Oh- we were too full for dessert, darn it!"
kefi-knoxville,Elizabeth R.,"Gainesville, GA",5/27/2022,5.0,Our favorite restaurant in Knoxville - we hit it every time we come up. Food is consistently good. The roasted chicken with rice pilaf is my favorite!! The drink flights are always a favorite with everyone we bring. Favorite appetizers are the shrimp and the saganaki  is amazing!!  We also love the Greek salad.  I'd you're looking for a great restaurant - this is it!!
kefi-knoxville,Sarah M.,"Charlotte, NC",5/22/2021,5.0,"I'm so glad to see that Knoxville is being presented with amazing food and and an even more amazing dining experience. You can tell from the ceiling to the floor how much thought and design was put into this restaurant. There a small plate type of dining experience with some larger plates available. My boyfriend and I shared the Sabanaki which was flambeau in front of us at the table, we also had their traditional spanakopita with the lamb chops which were so perfectly cooked and portioned with grilled apricots. We finished the night with 4 cocktails and an amazing baklava for around $130 with tip. Well worth the amazing food and experience. I so wish we could remember our servers name. She was a really cool girl with dirty blonde hair and glasses and was absolutely delightful.  We will definitely be back when we're in the Knoxville area."
kefi-knoxville,Michelle R.,"Knoxville, TN",4/30/2021,4.0,"Kefi is a solid spot for vegetarians in Knoxville with way more options than other restaurants in the area. For the most part the food is pretty good, but I feel like I'm always disappointed by at least one small plate I order (usually the grape leaves). I definitely recommend the Pikilia (spread sampler) which has consistently been delicious -- it's always hard to choose a favorite spread when they're all *that* good. Cheese mezze is also a personal favorite, but best to order when dining-in and not to go. I'd say Kefi is a little pricey, but the atmosphere is also a little more elevated which is nice."
kefi-knoxville,Dr C.,"Sevierville, TN",3/17/2022,5.0,"Those of who know me, know I rarely give a 5/star rating, so when I do, take that to the bank!! This place is a A+++ From the ambiance when you first walk in to the knowledgeable service (thanks Doug!), delicious drinks and the food....oh the food...We tried everything and not one single thing we tried was a miss, I would gladly do it all over, EXACTLY the same. Thanks Gang!!! See ya soon!!!"
kefi-knoxville,Mary G.,"Knoxville, TN",7/18/2022,5.0,Pricey but worth it! A twist on classic Greek dishes. I enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Cute for a date night.
kefi-knoxville,Jenn W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/16/2021,5.0,"Such a fun experience!  I've heard lots about Kefi since it opened, and I finally tried it out a few weeks ago with some friends.We started with some drink flights, as well as appetizers of Spicy Feta Cheese Spread and Flaming Cheese.  Both appetizers were delicious!  And I really enjoyed being able to try out a variety of cocktails.For entrees, two in our party ordered the cod special for that night.  I thought it was good, but wasn't blown away.  My husband had the Kokinisto (beef short ribs) and loved them!  One issue we had was that one friend ordered the Pastitsio (baked pasta), but when it arrived and she'd had several bites, it turned out to be the Moussaka (eggplant and potato dish).  They look similar when baked.  Server was kind enough to remove from the bill, however it was pretty disappointing for my friend to miss out on the meal he'd ordered.Service was good, and this is a beautiful restaurant.  It was very, very busy on the weekend night we were there."
kefi-knoxville,Anne W.,"Knoxville, TN",11/10/2021,5.0,"Wish we had pictures of the food, as it was amazing! Some of the best flavors and everything was delivered with artistic flair. All our senses were indulged in exquisite luxury! Aiden our server was attentive & selected our plates. Chris made sure we were treated as VIPs, and Bobby made us feel welcome & relaxed."
kefi-knoxville,Chris M.,"Knoxville, TN",1/31/2022,5.0,"Awesome place, one of our best date nights.  First, just order a cocktail flight, their mixologists are spectacular.  Then when the food comes be prepared for more goodness.  We sampled several dishes, all good, actually beyond good.  Place has a nice vibe in the old city.  It's quite accessible and they made sure we had a good table.  Wheelchair easily went in and out, had a good place to help my wife.  Parking in the old city can be a challenge, we found a spot on the street and the sidewalks were wide enough for the lift.  Don't miss Kefi!!"
kefi-knoxville,Jay D.,"Baltimore, MD",2/3/2020,4.0,"I love that Kefi exists because it brings some much needed swank to Knoxville. This place looks like you could've picked it up from somewhere else and placed it into old city. The bar looks cool, and I like the couches area. The lighting is nice too, although I'm pretty sure the white hanging lamps are from Ikea (but no judgment, I'd be buying from Ikea if I owned a business too).The drinks are decent, despite the fact that they're on tap, and it's nice that you can buy flights. The food is generally good, although some items are better than others. I like the meat based things (especially the meatballs and octopus) but my friends who are vegetarian haven't been impressed with the food. Also, (unpopular opinion) the flaming cheese dish is just bad - if you don't eat it while it's hot enough to burn your tongue, the cheese cools down and tastes like rubber, so in the end, the excitement of the flaming plate is all you're left with. Having said all that, I always leave Kefi feeling good about the overall experience, so I really do recommend it."
kefi-knoxville,F G.,"TN, TN",6/7/2022,5.0,"Hands down the best place in Knoxville for a nice dinner out with friends or for a date night. If you like an Old Fashion, they have the BEST here in town!"
kefi-knoxville,Heidi M.,"Nashville, TN",12/7/2021,5.0,"Kefi is the best restaurant we've been to in Knoxville. We started with the flaming cheese, and it is a must. We had Greek salad as our cold Mezz and the shrimp as a hot Mezz. Both were good, but the shrimp was my favorite. We had short ribs as our shared main, and it was also outstanding. We had to take our baklava to go because we were too full. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."
kefi-knoxville,Ben W.,"Knoxville, TN",2/17/2020,5.0,"Absolutely love Kefi! From the moment I walked in, I was drawn by the modern decor and wonderful original artwork (shout out to Mark Carson English for those paintings). We were sat in a really cool semi-circle booth, which was perfect. The shrimp and the saganaki were stars of the food show. We will coming back often!"
kefi-knoxville,Alexis B.,"Baltimore, MD",11/18/2019,4.0,"My husband and I were driving from Nashville to Gatlinburg this past Friday and decided to stop in at Kefi for dinner (I'd been looking for a reason to be in Knoxville at dinnertime to eat at Kefi for a while!). We tried to make a reservation that week but they were full; however, I signed up for an alert on Resy if any reservations opened up and one did for 7:45 pm on Friday. We took it. (I'm glad we did because even though their website says that they try to reserve space for walk-ins, there wasn't any room for walk-ins when we were there. They were telling people 1-2 hour wait when we got there a few minutes before our reservation.)First - the food. Kefi is a shared plates restaurant, so my husband and I decided to share three hot mezze and then a dessert. We got the gigantes plaki (giant beans with roasted tomato and onions), baked kibbeh (spiced beef with pine nuts, onion, and yogurt), and the paidakia (roasted lamb chops with grilled apricots and cherry demi glace) for our mezze. All of them were good! For our dessert, we shared a chocolate pudding with Greek yogurt and black cherries, which was also good. Overall, the food was very good. Just not best meal of the year good. Definitely ""would-go-back-next-time-I'm-in-Knoxville"" good. The drink menu is varied and large, but they didn't have many wine options by the glass. I went with the house red (an Italian wine), which was fine. My husband stuck with his usual whiskey on the rocks. The service was great; our server Carli was lovely. What I didn't love as much? We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were told our table wasn't ready yet. But we weren't told how long it would be. There's not a large dedicated area to stand when you're waiting for a table, so we just hovered awkwardly near the door for about 15 minutes (we were never told how long the wait for our table would be) until our name was called. I very much recommend getting a reservation on the weekend, but there was a really long wait, and we even had to wait a while for our reserved table. Other than that, I thought the chairs were kind of ridiculous (pretty low, so the table was very high). Otherwise, it was a very good meal.Good food, good service. About average prices (at least for what we're used to in Nashville). An overall good meal."
kefi-knoxville,T T.,"Seymour, TN",1/18/2022,5.0,Yes yes yes! Loved everything we ate! Craft cocktails are fun to try. Reservations are full on weekends and bar is full. Best Mediterranean food I've had. Can't wait to go back.
kefi-knoxville,John B.,"Lexington, KY",12/4/2019,5.0,"A place I picked from reviews as the best vegetarian-friendly restaurant in Knoxville. I'm not local so I can't compare to anything local, but it was excellent by any standard. The atmosphere was upscale with a choice of chairs or booths that looked very comfortable either way. The menu is small plates, with a wide variety of legitimately different choices. I had to think a fair amount and I could have ordered any number of appealing combinations (though I was a bit miffed that the hummus with fava beans I saw on their online menu wasn't available), but I was quite happy with what I ended up with based on recommendations.The halloumi was an indulgence, but it was nicely crisped, and the accompanying salad of arugula, a couple of strawberries, and some yellow tomatoes I think created excellent contrasts of flavor and texture and makes you feel like you aren't eating pure fat. Of course, the reality is that halloumi is heavy stuff, so I counterbalanced it with an order of gigantes, large beans in a tomato-based stew, a basic enough dish but their rendition was as tasty as I've had. Somehow, I managed to get out of a Greek restaurant without a pita, which was fine by me on this occasion.I got reasonably good service, attentive but oddly I found myself waiting a bit at times despite the fact that it was not crowded on a midweek night. Most people there seemed to be on dates or work get-togethers, and if I were in Knoxville looking for a place to meet up and share food, I'd go here."
kefi-knoxville,Donald R.,"Knoxville, TN",9/14/2021,5.0,"I have to echo and repeat all of the other five star reviews for this place.  The atmosphere is amazing.  It's classy, it's romantic, it's serene...it's just perfect, especially for an impressive date night.  The bar is equally impressive and unique.  My wife and I sat at the bar for drinks and snacks.  There are only two options (white and red) for wine-by-the-glass.  The bartender let my wife try each.  She settled on the white.  I had bourbon on the rocks.  They offer the large square ice cube that fills the whole glass. We ordered the meat balls with Tzatziki sauce, and the bread basket with the three remaining dips available on the appetizer menu. We LOVED our food.  The dips are both fresh and very tasty. The spicy feta wasn't too spicy. The bread was perhaps the best flat bread I've eaten.  The bartender service was excellent.  I highly recommend this establishment.  The only note is that you can expect to spend quite a bit."
kefi-knoxville,Chris O.,"Knoxville, TN",6/26/2021,5.0,Always delicious. Had a seasonal cocktail that I hope will make it to the menu: Karpouzi. Sweet but not too sweet. Rum + watermelon + lime.
kefi-knoxville,Chris O.,"Knoxville, TN",7/3/2019,5.0,"7/1/19 - Updated ReviewBack at it!! This time let me talk cocktails. Of course I took advantage of the flight. Tried: Meraki Sling (gin), Tears of Chios (vodka), and Nectar of Iris (rum). My three new favs. All different but delicious. My most favorite out of these three was Tears but I will definitely get this flight combo again. The flower garnishes. I can't get enough.Loved the flaming cheese app, but went with another cheesy starter: Feta Brûlée. Even better. Little tiny balls of honey make this dish unique but simple at the same time. If you're a vegetarian, the beets are a must order. Too much feta in one meal, right? WRONG. So wrong. If you're a vegetarian, order these. Even if you are not a fan of beets. Also tried Baked Kibbeh - this was good but overshadowed by the other two apps. I liked the whole pine nuts hidden in these meat balls, but I'll order a different hot mezze next time.We wanted to branch out and try the octopus this time, but played it safe with the shrimp. It's going to be hard not ordering this every time. Still the same AMAZING dish. The best thing on the menu I'm convinced.Finally got baklava. Really good and what you'd think it would taste like - except with pistachio ice cream on the side. I actually liked the ice cream better than the baklava! Great combo and I'd recommend trying if you want dessert. I couldn't finish so took home for breakfast. Great decision.Another thing to note - they are open on MONDAYS!! They were a bit short staffed, but Dan took care of us. He was playing server and bartender so he was quite busy but he nailed the drinks and recommendations. Will be back next month with updates :)"
kefi-knoxville,Chris O.,"Knoxville, TN",5/4/2019,5.0,"Update: 5/3Apparently I'm making it a point to go back at least once a month :) rating stays the same although there are some new things we tried that weren't my favorite. Again. Love love love that we were able to get a reservation and waltz right to our table. Private booth this time and it was perfect for date night.Ordered flaming cheese this time and LOVED it. Combo of salty and sweet (jam on top) was perfect for an appetizer. They came with slices of bread all on the skillet so tip for next time: turn the bread over so it doesn't burn on the bottom.Also tried another app: Muhammara - the red pepper dip. This was good but interesting - it's the consistency of chili but it's vegetarian. The crunched up nuts give it a different texture but it was nice to try.Drinks: Husband ordered the featured drink (Kerasi) and was not a fan. It was a mix of cherry whiskey and cider which just did not do it for me. It was very boozy and did the trick though! ;) I did the cocktail flight to try some of the other drinks on the menu. It's so fun to get three pretty drinks at one time. I can't get over the little clothespins used to pin the decorative flowers on the rim! Ordered: Crocus 75, Maid in Cuba and Throw of Aphrodite. I really liked the Maid in Cuba - perfect drink for spring/summer. Crocus was kind of a syrupy wine drink that would have been good after dinner if you like that kind of thing (this has the brandy in it) but it was good. I wasn't crazy about the Aphrodite drink. Next time I'm trying: Tears if Chips, Nectar of Iris and Meraki Sling.Food: did the short ribs again because they were so good last time and actually found something to trump them...the shrimp. Wow. Needed about 5 orders of these...and a pile of pasta underneath. The sauce is unbelievably good and the shrimp are cooked perfectly. Thankfully we had some pitas leftover to make sure no sauce stayed on the plate. Still had no room for baklava so that's still on the list for next time :("
kefi-knoxville,Chris O.,"Knoxville, TN",4/8/2019,5.0,"This review is just as much for convincing you that Kefi will be your new favorite restaurant in Knoxville as it is for myself to read next time I go to remind me what to order.First off, the fact they take reservations for early in the night is key for this old lady! Loved arriving and getting seated five minutes later while I passed a packed waiting area. The ambiance is fabulous. Love the comfy club chairs. Service was top notch - the hand held devices were so smart and efficient. Food timing was perfect. Didn't sit at the bar but read about the USB ports. Genius!Aparif Sparkler - this was my first cocktail after nine months of pregnancy, so it may just be that I really missed alcohol, but this was so good! Came with pear slices on the top and was crisp with a hint of licorice. Didn't see the flight of 3 on the menu so next time, that will be what I order.Manhattan with cherries - this was a special my husband ordered. And wow. Those cherries. Hoping this becomes a regular on the menu.3 spreads - we wanted to try and 3 hummuses (plural?)...and the butter and pine nuts was my favorite. Will order Muhammara to try next time.Kokinisto (Short Ribs) - OMG. No words. Best dish I've eaten in Knoxville. Ceased all dinner conversation. Will never not order this when I go.Moussaka - delicious vegetation dish. Even better leftover on the second day. We missed out on ordering so many things, but it just solidified our decision to come back. Definitely need to try the pistachio baklava. Bravo!!"
kefi-knoxville,Colleen R.,"Knoxville, TN",6/13/2019,5.0,"CHEESE SET AFLAME, TABLE SIDE.Oh, are you still reading?!  That wasn't enough?!  because I'm here to tell you - cheese on fire IS ENOUGH.  But then!  Kefi offers SO. MUCH. MORE.Let's start with how absolutely cosmopolitan it feels inside this restaurant. I am just so proud of little 'ole Knoxville that we've got a restaurant that feels so ""big city"".  The decor is lovely, the lighting levels are spot on (catch that pun?), and the bar is a perfect focal point without disrupting the entire flow of the restaurant.THE COCKTAILS. ARE. ON. TAP.  Lawd have mercy!  And they are interesting and fragrant and original.  And you can get a flight of cocktails!  I enjoyed the Tears of Chios, and it was as pretty as it was delicious.  Not too boozy, or too sweet.I've been here several times, but my latest dining experience was enjoyed with a friend who is an adventurous eater.  So, we shared the octopus small plate, and it was tasty and tender.  I know it looks all 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea!  Don't let that scare you!  Order it!We also enjoyed the beets small plate.  And that flaming cheese, y'all.  Those three small plates were the perfect amount of food for two people.Kefi I will see you again soon!"

kefi-knoxville,Jade G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/3/2020,5.0,"I must say after moving to Knoxville I was quickly on the hunt for the best foodie spots in the city and this #1Hang in there this review is a bit long but I promise it will be worth the read!I have eaten with them for date night, group dinners and taken orders to go and every time service is flawless, the staff is attentive, the bartenders are mixologist from heaven and there is always enough to take home !Today I want to say something more about service ! At this time all restaurants are closed or like Kefi they are on modified menus, service is to-go menus, family style or something other than usual due to the CV-19 pandemic. I live downtown at The Daniel and decided since today was my birthday I would order some dinner to go. Long story short some of the menu items have been modified to family style servings and some are single servings I ordered something from each and didn't realize I had only ordered a single-serving meat portion. When I called the restaurant Jeremy answered the phone and said no problem go ahead and place your order online and we will get it delivered. At that point, my son was hungry I already had other food and decided not to place the order.Less than 15 minutes later Jeremy called me downstairs at the door and as a gratis not only made the second delivery for free the food was free in The second order. As if that wasn't superior service all by itself there was a yellow box that I thought was a box of dessert. No the yellow box was a beautiful necklace from Kendra Scott! When I tell you I was floored and moved to tears I don't know if the staff will ever know how kind and thoughtful this really was! My birthdays are always very special my father passed away on my birthday many years ago but one of the last gifts he gave me was a necklace. Jeremy (The General Manager) you literally moved me to tears you had no idea what my story was you had no idea how meaningful this was but you have a loyal customer and friend for life thank you for your kindness thank you for being so thoughtful and thank you for amazing food and service! If anyone is reading this review and we are still on modified restaurant hours please support this local business and remember to give them thumbs up for outstanding service!"

What more can you ask for? Oh, good food and GREAT cocktails? Yup and Yup. Glad to say that I want to come back to Kefi to dine again and again and my group and I were SSOOO beyond pleasantly surprised by how good it was in every way! (Decor, Staff, Drinks, Food, everything.)Bread array- Great variety and very tasty Halloumi Cheese: OMG This cheese is life. For real. Tasting of spreads- Pick a tasting of 3 spreads, definitely the way to go !!Saganaki -  Aka the flaming cheese -  no no, OMGGGG THIS cheese is life too(?) so good :0)Spinach Pie - I would skip it but I come from the land of Empanadas and such (MIA) the rest of the group loved them indeed. Array of cocktails- too many to list, we had to try them all as one must) they do offer a tasting trio with your choice of 3 cocktails, I think I would go that way next time had I seen it earlier :0) Cocktails are gorgeous and well crafted, they also do not take 40 minutes to be crafted and delivered which is a major win. No negatives here kids - if you're in the area GO!"
kefi-knoxville,Sarah F.,"Maryville, TN",8/8/2021,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic meal and experience. We came here for our anniversary and making a reservation was a very easy process. We were seated in an adorable and cozy booth, and our waitress was incredibly kind and attentive. She gave us the perfect recommendations based on our preferences for cocktails and food. Every bite was something to savor! I highly recommend this restaurant, and I am excited to go back."
kefi-knoxville,Madison Y.,"Chicago, IL",2/19/2019,5.0,"Came here for a belated valentines day dinner with my boyfriend and was not disappointed. As they dont take reservations after 6 pm, we arrived around 8:30 on a Friday and hung out at the tables in the front and ordered a flight of three of their signature cocktails. Every single one was absolutely delicious and perfectly boozy to get us in the mood for our meal to come. We didnt even mind waiting for an hour because the booths were comfortable and the drinks were outstanding. Once we were moved from the low tables in the front to our booth, we decided to switch to wine and ordered an amazing bottle of red that we were shocked to see was only $24. The booth was trendy and intimate and made us feel like were were the only ones in the place - a perfect spot for a romantic date. For dinner we ordered the dip trio (MUST get the baba ghanoush), the saganaki, and the stuffed beef special. I personally died over the saganaki (essentially flaming cheese) but my boyfriend said he could have passed on it as it was too rich. That was nice because it meant more for me :) Overall the dinner was incredibly memorable and this place stands out amongst its competitors in Old City. We hope to return again for another special occasion."
kefi-knoxville,D S.,"Carytown, Richmond, VA",8/9/2021,5.0,Had dinner at the bar on a Sunday. Seats were very comfortable and the ambient sound level was low so it was easy to carry on a conversation among the three of us. A party next to us mentioned that cocktail flights were available so we tried them and they were fun and delicious! We got appetizers and a moussaka for sharing and had a great time
kefi-knoxville,Savannah H.,"Evergreen, Memphis, TN",8/29/2021,5.0,"this place is amazing!!! Great service and lovely atmosphere. if you love trying new foods, this is the place to go. The drinks are unique and delicious. The saganaki was the best dish out of the whole dinner. They light it on fire in front of you. Will be going back soon!"
kefi-knoxville,Adam O.,"Annandale, VA",7/15/2021,5.0,Our dinner was incredible!  The service was fantastic. We tried everything recommended by Doug our server and he was spot on!  It is now on the list of our top 5 in Knoxville!  Will be back for sure.Come with a large party and share lots of choices!  Fun atmosphere and excellent cuisine!Thanks Doug for a great evening and experience!
kefi-knoxville,Malena M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/16/2021,5.0,Fantastic experience and amazing food every time.  The short ribs are delicious.  Great place for sharing small plates and trying new foods.
kefi-knoxville,Julian T.,"Danville, VA",12/11/2019,5.0,"This place is absolutely gorgeous! The ambiance, the decor, the table setup, outstanding kindness and excellent service makes this my standout in Knoxville. The server made recommendations that we order for the table and share the food. It was not small tapas sizes either. We had the cheese that is caught on fire. meatballs, cauliflower, spanakopita, and baklava. I can't wait to come back."
kefi-knoxville,Kathleen K.,"New Haven, CT",7/24/2020,4.0,"We ordered Kefi for takeout, so I didn't get to see the inside, but let me take you on a little tour of the deliciousness that ensued. Here is what we ordered:1. Tzatziki sauce with assorted flatbread - I usually make my own tzatziki sauce at home when I make mediterranean food. This version was a bit thicker and had larger chunks of cucumber in it than I'm used to, but it was very tasty and paired well with the soft bread. Bread didn't appear to be made in-house, but they were soft and well-sized to enjoy with the other tapas style foods we ordered. 2. Spanokopita - You only get 3-4 when you order this, but they're actually impressively made. I personally didn't eat any of these, but my fiancee - who LOVES spanokopita - was very happy with the order. 3. Kokinisto - 5 starts, absolutely delicious. Truly. It is extremely tender, flavorful, and moist. Sometimes dishes like this can be a little stringy and dry, but not this one! I genuinely thought this was the star of the items we had ordered. 4. Greek Salad - Relatively small, so it's very good for one person as an appetizer or for two people looking to share as many tapas as possible. It comes with a large hunk of feta cheese, which admittedly was saltier than I typically like. The dressing was light and perfectly paired. I also loved the quality of the ingredients - nothing is worse than a salad with poor ingredients. 5. Keftedes - meatballs were tasty, but very dry. Probably wouldn't order these again with the Kokinisto on the table. 6. Falafel - also quite dry and a bit disappointing compared to other falafel I've had in the past, but the tahini sauce it comes in was good7. Garides - this shrimp dish is absolutely delightful! Flavorful, comforting, and buttery. The shrimp are huge and the sauce is not overpowering at all. Definitely on the list for next time. Overall, we love that we found Kefi and will likely be back again!"
kefi-knoxville,Krystal C.,"Fort Worth, TX",7/27/2019,5.0,"Another.... tens tens across the board! This place hits all levels for me Stopped in this spot while visiting one of my girlfriends in Knoxville. We had reservations for 6 pm on a Thursday night. There was a decent crowd. Before I get into the review I will say you will love this place even if you do not necessary like Greek food! Atmosphere: cozy modern vibe. There are large circle booths, tables or a nice bar to sit at. I really liked at the bar they have purse hooks and chargers at every seat! Nice touch! Service: Our waitress was absolutely fabulous! We ordered waaaaayyyy to much food for just us two ladies. Half way through the dinner the waitress came out and said she was waiting to put in our large entree to share because she thought it would be too much! And it was!! Saved us wasted food and 45 bucks! Food: let me start by saying I have been to several restaurants and drink spots. There are freaking cocktail flights here!! And not just small shot sized potions of their cocktails.... beautifully presented normal size drinks! So awesome! My friend and I just wanted to split a lot of little items. We had the olives, cauliflower( one of my favorites), tomato feta salad ( so good ), falafel, and the meatballs. I would order all again! Seriously, I don't think you can go wrong here! I would highly recommend this place for drinks, small bites, or a big family style dinner! I would drive two hours to eat here again! Tip: get the freaking cocktail sampler! Find cheaper street parking v the pay lot."
kefi-knoxville,Suzanne D.,"Saint Louis, MO",7/16/2019,5.0,"I continue to be impressed with the food scene in Knoxville. My recent visit to Kefi helped cement the idea that Knoxville is looking to become a foodie city.The build out at Kefi is magnificent. It is very posh and elegant, setting the mood for an outstanding dining experience.My visit was for a business dinner. We started with cocktails that fit the Mediterranean profile of the restaurant. Not only were they delicious, but were artful as well. We moved to wine later in the evening. The wine list was varied and approachable with a good price pointFor dinner, we chose several small plates as well as the short ribs for the table. The timing of the dishes was excellent. We never had too much on the table to overwhelm, but plenty of offerings from which to choose. The traditional hummus was perfection. It's served with pita and crackers but since we had someone gluten free, they also brought a variety of crudités. My favorite dish of the evening was the octopus. It had large pieces and was expertly prepared--flavorful and tender.Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing. Never did we feel rushed as we talked business and enjoyed our meal. I definitely recommend Kefi and will be visiting again on future trips."

kefi-knoxville,Cass G.,"Knoxville, TN",11/8/2020,5.0,"The perfect dining experience.  Saturday night we started with a drink at the bar.  Lala was amazing, she explained some of the menu, made a great cocktail for my lady friend, and made some great recommendations.  We where seated shortly after.  The restaurant is very classy, and comfortable. Our waiter, Reese was a pleasure and really a great addition to our dining experience.  I was blown away by all 3 of the dishes we ordered.  The food was AMAZING!  I would be willing to say the absolute best in Knoxville.  I was pleasantly shocked with the bill, don't tell them, but I would have paid way more!  Bravo to the entire staff."
kefi-knoxville,Atlee M.,"Knoxville, TN",6/5/2019,3.0,"Big city feel in the scruffy city. Kefi is such a fun place to test out small batch cocktails and tasty Greek and Mediterranean sharable plates. I have been three times now. I try a different drink and plate each time. The pricing during happy hour is not quite the deal I typically look for, but ultimately know I am paying for experience as well. The first two times I visited I commented on the difference in menu prices from the front window to the printed one for the table. They list $13 as the flight price and it is actually $21. This is not a small difference and should be changed.The flight is three, half size cocktails. Unless you are ordering three of the most expensive ones, you are paying the price of two cocktails but actually getting 1.5, so it isn't actually a deal. The food has be great each time! Try all the cheeses! I am looking forward to updating the rating when the above concerns of price differences are addressed."
kefi-knoxville,Sumeeth V.,"Nashville, TN",6/9/2019,3.0,"I'm torn in writing this review because of how absolutely outstanding the ambiance and cocktails were in this restaurant, but how decidedly average every single dish we ordered was.We started with a flight of cocktails. Each cocktail is served off draft, and each one blew us away after the next. There is something to meet just about every palate from this drink menu, and the cocktail sampler is a steal for any three on the menu. The Penicillin is a rare find (regrettably did not order that one).From start to finish, though, our meal left a lot to be desired, especially given how much money we spent. We ordered the butter hummus, spicy feta, and baba ghanoush flight of spreads. Everything was just okay, and the falafel and spanakopita we ordered in addition were nothing special. The gyro was good, but completely underwhelming (seriously, you can go to any NYC street corner and get something tastier). The kokakia was also just okay, but fortunately, the baklava was huge and outstanding. That was the savior to our meal. Definitely worth every bite, and the pistachio gelato it was served with was fantastic.We would come back, but just for the drinks."
kefi-knoxville,Trinity E.,"Knoxville, TN",7/8/2019,5.0,"Wow!!! This place is a great addition to Knoxville. Honestly the whole time i was there I felt i was on vacation. I didn't feel like i was just a few blocks from my home. The atmosphere is gorgeous! The staff was very knowledgeable about their drinks, and the food was amazing. Tapas style eats.  Good to share with friends. We sat at the bar, it was fun watching the bartenders make beautiful drinks. I look forward to my next visit! There was a wait in the restaurant, but after eating here it is totally worth the wait."

kefi-knoxville,Erika M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/15/2019,5.0,"Guys, I love everything about this place. I could give this place five stars just based on the face that they have cocktail flights and flaming cheese.  Right?!  But there are a million other things that make this place wonderful.  The thought that went into Kefi when putting it together is very apparent.  Example?  They have individual USB ports at each stool at the bar AND they light up so you don't have to fish around for them in the dimly lit ambiance.  The space itself is unlike anything else in Knoxville.  It's hip without looking like it's trying too hard.  They have a variety of table sizes for various party sizes and even have a comfortable place to sit if you just want snacks and drinks without having to sit at the bar.  The food and drink totally hit the mark for me.  Their cocktails are creative and unique.  The food is served mostly in small plates, which is totally my jam.  Oh, and it's delicious.  It's a nicer restaurant for Knoxville so expect to pay a little more, but it's totally worth it.  And if you're looking for something a little lighter on the wallet, check out their happy hour.  It's sure to not disappoint!"

kefi-knoxville,Natasha S.,"CONCORD FARR, TN",1/30/2021,2.0,Overpriced food. It looks great but don't think it's worth the money. It just looks like a fancy place that can charge you the high price tag.

Will definitely be coming back!
kefi-knoxville,Colin C.,"Oak Ridge, TN",2/10/2021,5.0,"What a wonderful place to spend an evening. Whether it be a business dinner with out of town clients with good taste, to an intimate date night with someone you want to impress, to a fun night with friends, Keri is the spot. The food is simply excellent - I have yet to enjoy something from this menu that was one of the best examples of that dish I ever had. And the cocktails - from what I understood, they pre-batch every cocktail and make all their own cocktail ingredients. The results are spectacular. Top this off with great service and a really nice ambience, and Kefi is a personal favorite, for Knoxville and beyond."
kefi-knoxville,Ken R.,"Gainesville, GA",2/6/2021,5.0,Fantastic upscale/urban Greek food. Bespoke handmade cocktails.  Love this place and the service is outstanding.
kefi-knoxville,Stephanie W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/23/2020,5.0,We love Kefi! Food and drinks are wonderful. Try the octopus. One of my absolute favorites. Also love getting the bar tenders drink of choice!

kefi-knoxville,Tracy C.,"Corryton, TN",8/9/2020,5.0,Went to celebrate my husband's birthday. The Greek food was outstanding! Highly recommend and cannot wait to return.
kefi-knoxville,Brittany H.,"Louisville, TN",7/24/2020,4.0,"We went with my sister and brother in law. We had the flight of drinks which were all amazing. We tried the flamingo cheese which was amazing. We also tried the hummus, spicy feta and taziki dips.  we had the lamb and beef meatballs and they were pretty good! The shrimp was the best! I would go back just for that. Lastly we had the chicken gyros which again was good. I loved the variety of foods. We will be back!!"
kefi-knoxville,Kathleen K.,"New Haven, CT",7/24/2020,4.0,"We ordered Kefi for takeout, so I didn't get to see the inside, but let me take you on a little tour of the deliciousness that ensued. Here is what we ordered:1. Tzatziki sauce with assorted flatbread - I usually make my own tzatziki sauce at home when I make mediterranean food. This version was a bit thicker and had larger chunks of cucumber in it than I'm used to, but it was very tasty and paired well with the soft bread. Bread didn't appear to be made in-house, but they were soft and well-sized to enjoy with the other tapas style foods we ordered. 2. Spanokopita - You only get 3-4 when you order this, but they're actually impressively made. I personally didn't eat any of these, but my fiancee - who LOVES spanokopita - was very happy with the order. 3. Kokinisto - 5 starts, absolutely delicious. Truly. It is extremely tender, flavorful, and moist. Sometimes dishes like this can be a little stringy and dry, but not this one! I genuinely thought this was the star of the items we had ordered. 4. Greek Salad - Relatively small, so it's very good for one person as an appetizer or for two people looking to share as many tapas as possible. It comes with a large hunk of feta cheese, which admittedly was saltier than I typically like. The dressing was light and perfectly paired. I also loved the quality of the ingredients - nothing is worse than a salad with poor ingredients. 5. Keftedes - meatballs were tasty, but very dry. Probably wouldn't order these again with the Kokinisto on the table. 6. Falafel - also quite dry and a bit disappointing compared to other falafel I've had in the past, but the tahini sauce it comes in was good7. Garides - this shrimp dish is absolutely delightful! Flavorful, comforting, and buttery. The shrimp are huge and the sauce is not overpowering at all. Definitely on the list for next time. Overall, we love that we found Kefi and will likely be back again!"
kefi-knoxville,Kevin S.,"Savannah, GA",7/23/2020,5.0,Great bar with uniquely crafted mixed drinks and tapas style food. Don't skip the baklava.
kefi-knoxville,Abbey S.,"Chattanooga, TN",7/18/2020,5.0,"Amazing service, food is delicious! I got the shrimp & my fiancé got the lamb which we both loved. Cocktail flights are super fun & a good price. They even gave me a free dessert for my birthday dinner!"
kefi-knoxville,Darling V.,"Maryville, TN",5/31/2020,5.0,"We went to Kefi for the first time last night as a surprise for our mom. Having lived in Greece as a teen, she was thoroughly excited to try as much on the menu as possible. The quality and authenticity of these family recipes made her so happy she cried. The food was top notch, the waiter absolutely fantastic, they treated my disabled mother and her service dog with dignity, the kitchen accommodated our allergies quite well, and the atmosphere was delightfully cozy. A bit on the pricey side to be an every day event for the average Joe, but worth making special plans for. If I could give them more stars, I would. Planning to come back ASAP."
kefi-knoxville,Jade G.,"Knoxville, TN",4/3/2020,5.0,"I must say after moving to Knoxville I was quickly on the hunt for the best foodie spots in the city and this #1Hang in there this review is a bit long but I promise it will be worth the read!I have eaten with them for date night, group dinners and taken orders to go and every time service is flawless, the staff is attentive, the bartenders are mixologist from heaven and there is always enough to take home !Today I want to say something more about service ! At this time all restaurants are closed or like Kefi they are on modified menus, service is to-go menus, family style or something other than usual due to the CV-19 pandemic. I live downtown at The Daniel and decided since today was my birthday I would order some dinner to go. Long story short some of the menu items have been modified to family style servings and some are single servings I ordered something from each and didn't realize I had only ordered a single-serving meat portion. When I called the restaurant Jeremy answered the phone and said no problem go ahead and place your order online and we will get it delivered. At that point, my son was hungry I already had other food and decided not to place the order.Less than 15 minutes later Jeremy called me downstairs at the door and as a gratis not only made the second delivery for free the food was free in The second order. As if that wasn't superior service all by itself there was a yellow box that I thought was a box of dessert. No the yellow box was a beautiful necklace from Kendra Scott! When I tell you I was floored and moved to tears I don't know if the staff will ever know how kind and thoughtful this really was! My birthdays are always very special my father passed away on my birthday many years ago but one of the last gifts he gave me was a necklace. Jeremy (The General Manager) you literally moved me to tears you had no idea what my story was you had no idea how meaningful this was but you have a loyal customer and friend for life thank you for your kindness thank you for being so thoughtful and thank you for amazing food and service! If anyone is reading this review and we are still on modified restaurant hours please support this local business and remember to give them thumbs up for outstanding service!"
kefi-knoxville,Todd G.,"Staffordsville, KY",3/8/2020,1.0,"I'll be honest, this one hurts. My wife likes a sexy vibe atmosphere Kefi delivers that, the problem is she and I both want services to be met, in other words the atmosphere can only deliver so much then the service and food has to do its part. Our waiter set the tone for the evening, two members of our party had questions about the menu and he was clearly frustrated and told them ""the menu is self explanatory "" it was kind of shocking especially to someone like me who doesn't like controversy, after that everyone was afraid to ask any more questions so they ordered their food and hoped for the best. We joined our friends there for a birthday celebration, everyone ordered Moscow mules and they came in glasses versus copper mugs (eye roll) , they also came lacking any ginger but was loaded with fruit juice. Aesthetically pleasing drinks, yes but not a mule. On to the food, the appetizers were again very aesthetically pleasing to the eye but average. The seared cheese was the best but we can do that at home for less. Now let's move to entrees, I had the baked spaghetti special and it was mediocre especially for the $22 price tag, but I ate it and was fine. The rest of the party ordered lamb... it came cold. ICE cold. We also ordered chicken meatballs, if you want to lose a tooth order those. All in all this is a place to go to for pita bread and a glass of wine w a cool atmosphere . Go somewhere else for dinner. Kefi is like dating someone really good looking but don't expect anything more, you are there for the looks."
kefi-knoxville,Sarah N.,"Richmond, VA",10/4/2020,5.0,"We loved our food and Reese was a fantastic waiter! The drinks, dips, bread, and entrees were all amazing. We were given complimentary champagne as it was our anniversary. We will definitely be back!"

We had the  baba ghanoush, hummus and beef short ribs (very large portion!)We'll be back for the lamb chops, baklava, and ouzo! Very happy we found this place! Happy hour deals here are fantastic! Be sure to call ahead if you're dining on weekends as space can be limited."

kefi-knoxville,Dee K.,"Centreville, VA",11/7/2019,5.0,"Beat ambiance, solis food. One of my fav places! Grilled octopus was my favorite. I could have eaten the dip sampler all night. Flaming cheese w the house bread was divine."
kefi-knoxville,Christina W.,"Knoxville, TN",8/30/2019,5.0,"One of my new favorite spots in K-Town. Everything we had was fresh, authentic, and soooo tasty, even the beet chips came fresh out of the fryer! Service was great on a busy Friday night. Perfect date night!  Travis was our server this evening, and he was absolutely fabulous!!  If you haven't tried Kefi, yet, I don't know what you're waiting for."
kefi-knoxville,Sarah P.,"Knoxville, TN",6/10/2019,5.0,"The food, the fancy schmancy drink menu, the decor...YES. Menu highlights for me: the spicy feta dip and the FLAMING CHEESE duh. I can also speak for the hummus, the baba ganoush, and the souvlaki. All are delicious, as I have a feeling the entire menu is. My current greatest weakness in life? I can't hang with the cocktail flight (blasphemy, I know). While all three cocktails were delicious works of art, mixing the liquors, the various sweeteners, and ALLLLL the food was too much. Next time, I'll stick to my favorite of my flight, which is the Crocus 75 (gin based and delicious). **I'm working on righting the wrong that is my intolerance to the cocktail flight. Okay, the decor. It's all plush seating and dim lighting with a fancy lounge type feel. Honestly, even if you're the pickiest eater on the planet and know you won't touch the food, it would still be worth a trip for a drink and the ambiance. Probably I would like to live here, if that could be arranged."
kefi-knoxville,Alexia G.,"Knoxville, TN",6/19/2019,5.0,"We ate so much variety, sharing every plate. This is like we are in Greece. It is evident the chef only uses quality ingredients. Fresh and authentic. OPA"

Our server Kate made our entire night so much fun and all we did was laugh. She is very knowledgeable and helped us so much. Love it! Can't wait to revisit
kefi-knoxville,Rachel H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3/14/2019,5.0,"I had heard great things about this new restaraunt and was excited to try it. I went with a friend on a Tuesday night without reservations. There was a bit of a wait so we elected to sit at the bar. The bar is spacious and comfortable and there was plenty of room for us to have multiple dishes comfortably. The bartenders were super friendly and knowledgeable. I tried the crocus cocktail that was gin and champagne and fruity, it was quite good. For all if us to share, we ordered saganaki, falafel, keftedes, and dolmades. Everything was visually appealing and tasted delicious. I especially loved the saganaki flaming cheese dish, its dramatic and also tastes wonderful. Thisbis a tapas restaraunt, so it is set up for people to order small plates for the table to share and ordering 4 tapas for 2 of us was plenty of food."
kefi-knoxville,Betsy L.,"Blowing Rock, NC",7/29/2019,4.0,"My husband and I have been a few times now,  so I feel confident giving this place 5 stars. Our anniversary was on Memorial Day this year, and our usual celebratory restaurants weren't open (Emilia and Lonesome Dove), so we made reservations at Kefi instead. We were not disappointed! First, as others have said, the atmosphere is perfect for a date: low lighting, cool music, and trendy/glam decor. The mezze-style dishes also make dining there feel like more of an event, which we like. When we went for our anniversary, we started by looking through their extensive cocktail list where everything looks delicious, and I think I said something like, ""since it's our anniversary, let's get the one with champagne in it!"" Our server must've overheard me, because at the end of our meal, he told us to pick out a dessert on the house since it was our anniversary. It was sweet and special!"
kefi-knoxville,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",4/7/2019,5.0,"Loved this place! The small plate concept is awesome because you get to try multiple dishes and share everything (or not!). We tried the avgolimono soupa, beef fatayar, keftedes, and galaktoboureko for dessert. The soup was so light and delicious. It's like an upscale chicken and rice soup. The beef fatayar were seasoned so well but I especially liked putting the tzatziki sauce from the meatball dish on them so they weren't so dry. My husband really liked the keftedes but I think because I'm sensitive to textures they weren't for me. The dessert was SO GOOD! I wasn't sure what to expect based on the description but the custard was warm and the pastry was flaky with just the right about of honey for sweetness. I could eat them every day! We also tried the Raki which was good and similar to a less sweet absinthe. With the meal though I preferred my glass of house white wine. It was dry and perfect. Can't wait to go back and try something else!"
kefi-knoxville,Cinda S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/13/2019,4.0,"Housed in a charming old building, and located in the heart of the Old City - this fairly new restaurant is sure to be a hit! The decor is upscale meets urban, with a half circle bar visible & prominent in the room. The noise level is quite high, probably due in part to the high ceiling and concrete floor.  The chairs at the table sat a little to low for my liking and we were moved to a booth with our server and the manager eager to make sure we were comfortable. We soon learned that this is like a Tapas restaurant only with Greek food, where everything is meant to be shared.  This was going to be a challenge for us, since one of us is a vegetarian!  Speaking of our server - Lauren - she went out of her way to make sure our meal & evening was wonderful. She moved around the room with efficiency making sure all her guests were well taken care of, and all with a smile on her face!  We started with 3 of the spreads which were served with 3 types of breads. The pita bread was wonderful as were the house made crackers, the bread was very dry & tasteless. Our favorite was the spicy feta, but we also liked the Muhamara.  We felt like the Baba Ghannouja did not have enough flavor.  The Fattoushj Salad was good, but I thought the deep fried pita wedges were to hard & oily. My husband graciously opted to forego ordering meat so that I could try the vegetarian entree Moussaka.  It was good, but I would have liked it to be like the one I had in Greece - with more layers of the potatoes, eggplant ect.  For dessert we ordered the Loukoumades, which is basically deep fried little donut type puffs drizzled with honey & cinnamon and crushed powdered walnuts. They were quite tough & chewy and had no taste. We only tasted the sweetness of the honey - I think they forgot to put the cinnamon on ours! Upon seeing that we were not eating more of them, Lauren inquired and learned that we did not care for them.  She apologized & then disappeared - and soon returned bringing us a Kokakia, which is a greek cream puff covered in chocolate. It was delicious!  There were so many delicious items on the menu, and the staff was so eager to please - that we will definitely be back!"
kefi-knoxville,Charles M.,"Las Vegas, NV",8/3/2019,5.0,"This is the latest and greatest creation from the American Greek family that brought Kalamata to Farragut so many years ago. Kalamata was my favorite Farragut restaurant of all time.This is a beautifully adorned and cool downtown restaurant.We arrived about 5PM on a Saturday night. We were without reservations so we ate at the bar.We enjoyed the Spicy Feta which came with pita.  The feta dip had the consistency of pimento cheese with chili peppers and feta it was mildly hot but could have been hotter.We split another dish the Beef Fatayar.  It was a pastry filled with beef, onion and pine nuts.  It was typical Greek fare and well done.The star of the evening was the Garides strongly recommended by the staff and up to all the accolades.  Large shrimp over grilled country bread along with Smokey tomato, feta and a delicious garlic butter sauce.  It was rich and crunchy and highly recommended.The service was excellent."
kefi-knoxville,Dan H.,"Tucson, AZ",12/29/2018,3.0,"Not a good experience and the food was seriously hit and miss. It started off well with a nice salad and eggplant dish, but the restaurant was so cold and drafty that it required we stay fully coated.  Once I brought this to their attention they did work to resolve it.  So we hung in there.  Dishes got progressively worse (we ordered quite a few things) and eventually we had to complain.  The owner attempted to explain away the bad taste as our inexperience or that other restaurants did it differently (ie we have had these dishes in other cities that were prepared quite well and I guess he was saying he did it right and our taste buds were wrong...   hmmm...  head scratcher there.) so he agreed to adjust our bill a little.  Now we are left sitting there still quite hungry, so we order another dish we felt would be a ""safe bet""... roasted chicken.  It got us full but frankly it was barely better than KFC at 3 times the cost. Why we ordered dessert after all this, I do not know, but what came next might best be described as ""Walmart Baklava"" - it tasted like what I imagine Baklava would taste like if Walmart served it at their food court.  And of course we got Luke warm coffee and tea to go with it.  I think the staff tried to make a bad situation better but we paid over $100 for a very bad experience, and had numerous truly awful tasting dishes.  Oh and the music was boom boom boom stuff non-stop. Not fitting at all. Not recommended."
kefi-knoxville,Emily C.,"Sterling, VA",2/16/2021,5.0,"Very fun atmosphere and super friendly wait staff. We loved our experience there last weekend. My only suggestions would be to make the menu a bit more clear as it's hard to understand the best way to order since there is everything from small plates to family-sized meals, but also specials which appear to be more of a traditionally sized entree. It was hard to know how much food to order for the three of us. Also, would be great to have more small plate options that are less bread-heavy. We ordered a few different small dishes to share vs one of the family sized entrees and we felt like every dish came with pita or bread of some sort and would have loved some dishes with shrimp and veggies, or other lighter options to compliment the cheese and bread dishes. We probably would have ordered more food but all the cheese and bread filled us up! Also, as a side note, the spicy feta appetizer is served cold (our fault for not asking about that though) so would love a hot feta option. Overall, it's a very fun, cozy place with a nice vibe. Will definitely go again and try some of the larger dishes."
kefi-knoxville,Beth C.,"New York, NY",5/27/2019,5.0,"Had an amazing time! Food was incredible. Cocktails were superb! Ambiance and service were excellent as well. Had beets, cauliflower, octopus, shrimp, hummus and tzatziki spread with pita. Will definitely be back next time we're in Knoxville."

We also got the souvlaki with lamb gyro for share, the lamb slices smell like heaven! For dessert, we can't decide between donuts and baklava, so we got them all. The donuts are mind blowing! So good that they have the crunchy skin and will melt in your mouth. Our service is very nice! Overall pretty awesome!"

kefi-knoxville,Donna L.,"Nolensville, TN",1/22/2019,5.0,"Walking into Kefi is like walking into a sophisticated big city restaurant! Beautiful design and a striking bar area in the middle of the restaurant! The food is amazing! This restaurant is run by the family who owned one of our past favorites, the west Knoxville  Kalimata Kitchen . We have gone three times and each time the food is incredible! We have had the appetizer with three dips and pita. We really enjoyed the spicy feta dip and the muhammara ( SP?). The most amazing entree we had were the short ribs served on polenta . I am not sure how they cooked the short ribs but they were incredibly tender and rich! The servers and staff members are friendly and helpful! They have a ice selection of wines, beer and some yummy craft cocktails ! A wonderful restaurant!"
kefi-knoxville,Chelsea R.,"Knoxville, TN",3/23/2019,5.0,"Big fan of this place. Everything about it is excellent. The decor, the vibe, the service, the food and the cocktails !! It's somehow both a family style and tapas concept. What more could you possibly want ? Allllll the food ! We loved basically everything. Started with the dip trio: spicy feta, tzatziki, and baba ghannouj. Favorites were the first two. The baba was fine, nothing wrong with it, but the other two were ALL STARS. Then we ordered the garides. Delicious shrimp in a heavenly sauce on a crostini. We ended with the kokinisto- braised short ribs. So these were phenomenal!!!! Just an FYI the portion is huge, like massive. Not complaining cause I'm all about the leftovers, but if you're not just be cognizant of that. The cocktails were also fantastic ! We both did the cocktail trio, and not only were they good size cocktails, but they were not lacking on the alcohol. Expertly crafted and really enjoyable. Don't miss the guava margarita! Overall an awesome spot!"
kefi-knoxville,Alaina Z.,"Iowa City, IA",12/27/2018,5.0,"Amazing Mediterranean cuisine! Delicious  would definitely go back!

kefi-knoxville,Dee O.,"Knoxville, TN",11/24/2018,5.0,"I am not sure I can add much to the other reviews but we had such a wonderful experience last night that I felt they deserved a glowing review. Make reservations if you can. We showed up at 6 pm on a Friday evening and there was a 45 minute wait. They have a full service bar one could wait at, as well as a nice lounge area behind the restaurant  with comfortable seats. We started off with drinks and apps. The cocktail flight is a genius idea. Not sure why no other Knoxville restaurant has picked up on it. I tried 3 delightful cocktails, each one a good size pour and each one was absolutely delicious. The Baba Ganoush was incredible. I was pretty much full after mostly finishing the serving by myself We got our table a few minutes into our apps and service was impeccable. We shared a bunch of small plates including meat pies, grape leaves and the beet salad. Our friends had just returned from a trip to Greece and they raved about how the food at Kefi was as good as what they had in Greece. Everything was really good and we had lots of leftovers to take home. Kefi was also reasonably priced. The ambience is nice enough for a very special event but the price tab would also work for a quick dinner on a day you don't feel like cooking. The owner was there during our visit and sweetly checked in on us a few times. I wasn't completely sure how I was going to feel about Kefi when the opening was announced but I am so glad they are in the neighborhood and I can't wait to visit again!"

I just don't care for their seasonings and style of cooking.Tried a lamb shank and cinnamon was the seasoning that slapped you in the face. Also tried the short ribs over polenta. Could not eat the naturally gluten free polenta, not sure what they did to it. The short ribs were nice and tender. I doubt I will return. We were part of a group and majority rules."
kefi-knoxville,Debra P.,"Knoxville, TN",11/24/2018,3.0,"Beautiful bar and dining room.The food we selected was not that exciting with the exception of the octopus. The stuffed grape leaves were dry and not very flavorful. The baba ganoogh was not mixed well and we got areas that were heavy in cumin.The cocktail sampler was good value. The prices were high for what you got and the happy hour selections, not great.The wine list was lacking in Greek wines, but heavy in Italian and French selections.We probably won't return."
kefi-knoxville,Amy B.,"Pickerington, OH",11/13/2018,5.0,"Great ambiance! It feels like you aren't in Knoxville. Spicy feta is great and the larger plates have plenty for 2 people. We each ordered a ""For the Table"" dish and had more than enough food for three people."
kefi-knoxville,Brittany H.,"Louisville, TN",7/24/2020,4.0,"We went with my sister and brother in law. We had the flight of drinks which were all amazing. We tried the flamingo cheese which was amazing. We also tried the hummus, spicy feta and taziki dips.  we had the lamb and beef meatballs and they were pretty good! The shrimp was the best! I would go back just for that. Lastly we had the chicken gyros which again was good. I loved the variety of foods. We will be back!!"
kefi-knoxville,Faith B.,"Milwaukee, WI",1/25/2019,4.0,"I visited Kefi over the holiday period with my family for a special dinner. The decor is very nice - sophisticated, but still warm. The big booths are cool.Although we had a reservation, our table wasn't ready for at least 30 minutes after that time. We found standing room at the bar for 2 and seats for three of us.The bartender was friendly, but they were overrun, so drinks took a little longer than we expected. And interestingly, although hey do flights of some cocktails on tap, they don't do flights of their ouzo style liquors, even though they have three.When we were seated our waiter service was uneven. He was nice, but he had a weird habit of wandering off before we could order all the things we wanted to order. Then he'd come back and we'd get a couple more things ordered and he'd take off again, leaving one person wanting another drink. Sort of ADHD service.The food was great. We had the hummus with butter and toasted pine nuts. The sagnaki was my favorite. Who doesn't love love flaming cheese and fresh bread? The meat eaters raved above the Avgolemono, Paidakia and Garides.The falafel was okay, but not extraordinary.The baklava was enormous and I'm told good. The Loukomades were good, but a little different than what I've had in the past, with a crispy outside.I will certainly go back and look forward to trying more items from the mezze-style menu."
kefi-knoxville,Jericka E.,"Knoxville, TN",1/14/2021,5.0,"Went for my 2 year anniversary and it was amazing! If you have not been here you need to change that immediately. I recommend the falafel, shrimp, and the Tears of Chios cocktail."
kefi-knoxville,Kelsey A.,"Marysville, OH",8/24/2020,3.0,I wasn't as impressed with Kefi as I thought I would be. It was good but perhaps the expectations were too high. We ordered the appetizer dip sampler. The hummus seemed a bit dry for me. The spicy feta was pretty good and the tzatziki was really good. We also ordered a cocktail flight. The sangria was pretty good but the others tasted of artificial flavorings. The lamb chops were so fatty I could barely eat them and the apricots served on the plate were cold and raw and did not seem a fitting part of the dish. The flaming cheese was fun but very greasy as the appeal of the table-side fire may have made this dish seem better than it actually was.
kefi-knoxville,Casey B.,"Mechanicsville, Richmond, VA",5/25/2019,5.0,Wonderful plates for the whole table will leave you feeling stuffed!  I can't wait to go back and try the next round of plates!

kefi-knoxville,William W.,"Farragut, TN",5/18/2019,5.0,"A wonderful find! Had no idea that this fantastic restaurant existed until recently. The best Greek and Mediterranean food ever! Better than NYC and other cities where I've traveled. Service was prompt and Chaz was attentive but not intrusive. He had a good understanding of the menu and his suggestions were right on target. The atmosphere is cozy, warm and classy. We loved the design of the booths which give more privacy than most. All in all, an unexpected treat in Knoxville!"
kefi-knoxville,Don H.,"Walland, TN",5/7/2019,5.0,"This is authentic as you can get in Knoxville !! I am not Greek but , I have had many Greek meals and the food is prepared perfectly! This is going to my regular spot. There is nothing like good Greek cooking. Give it a try, you may need a reservation this is a popular spot. Seating at the bar is usually open for no reservations."
kefi-knoxville,Don H.,"Walland, TN",4/12/2019,5.0,"Very clean , very private Booths for couples dining. Park next to Barleys . See updated review."
kefi-knoxville,Bill S.,"Brentwood, TN",5/4/2019,5.0,"Went to dinner with a party of 5. We shared numerous dishes, so that we each got a variety.  Same with the desserts. The spicy feta and muhammara were delicious. We enjoyed the saganaki and octipodi. For dessert we shared one of each. Our server was spot on."
kefi-knoxville,Keri B.,"New Orleans, LA",4/28/2019,5.0,"Delicious food, attentive service, and stylish ambiance. I look forward to going back! We shared the souvlaki and falafel, which was more than enough food for the two of us. The baklava was a hearty piece, with delicate, nuanced flavor."
kefi-knoxville,Ray B.,"Knoxville, TN",4/26/2019,5.0,"Went to Kefi for the first time for my wife's birthday and we were not disappointed.  Food, service and ambiance was top notch. Loved the octopus, shrimp, spinach phyllo triangles, and baklava. We put it up among our best dining experiences in Knoxville, we will be back."
kefi-knoxville,Mengya L.,"Knoxville, TN",4/20/2019,5.0,"Had an awesome double date night here! Make sure you have the reservation cuz this place is amazing and so popular! Several parkings under the bridge which is prob 3 min walking distance from kefi. The drinks are so pretty! Mine came with flower and apple slices, so fancy! The spicy feta cheese is a MUST TRY! We also got the souvlaki with lamb gyro for share, the lamb slices smell like heaven! For dessert, we can't decide between donuts and baklava, so we got them all. The donuts are mind blowing! So good that they have the crunchy skin and will melt in your mouth. Our service is very nice! Overall pretty awesome!"

kefi-knoxville,Saba S.,"Knoxville, TN",4/17/2019,5.0,"What a great addition to the Old City! My husband and I decided to try Kefi based on their amazing cocktail menu. The drinks did not disappoint, and we were equally impressed by the variety and quality of the food. The service was excellent, and each round of small plates we ordered came out almost immediately. Omg... the warm butter and toasted pine nut hummus was to die for. The atmosphere is both classy and cozy.  This will definitely be a top dinner destination when hosting friends from out-of-town!"
kefi-knoxville,Suz L.,"San Francisco, CA",4/14/2019,5.0,"Wow. Octopodi was my favorite for the evening and this restaurant could have easily been in Nashville, San Francisco or any large foodie city."
kefi-knoxville,Jen H.,"Walland, TN",4/7/2019,5.0,"Loved this place! The small plate concept is awesome because you get to try multiple dishes and share everything (or not!). We tried the avgolimono soupa, beef fatayar, keftedes, and galaktoboureko for dessert. The soup was so light and delicious. It's like an upscale chicken and rice soup. The beef fatayar were seasoned so well but I especially liked putting the tzatziki sauce from the meatball dish on them so they weren't so dry. My husband really liked the keftedes but I think because I'm sensitive to textures they weren't for me. The dessert was SO GOOD! I wasn't sure what to expect based on the description but the custard was warm and the pastry was flaky with just the right about of honey for sweetness. I could eat them every day! We also tried the Raki which was good and similar to a less sweet absinthe. With the meal though I preferred my glass of house white wine. It was dry and perfect. Can't wait to go back and try something else!"
kefi-knoxville,Karli S.,"Knoxville, TN",12/20/2019,4.0,The cocktail list is extensive and delicious. The menu prices may seem daunting but everything is meant to be shared. It's a gorgeous place that I love to take people to.
kefi-knoxville,Todd G.,"Staffordsville, KY",3/8/2020,1.0,"I'll be honest, this one hurts. My wife likes a sexy vibe atmosphere Kefi delivers that, the problem is she and I both want services to be met, in other words the atmosphere can only deliver so much then the service and food has to do its part. Our waiter set the tone for the evening, two members of our party had questions about the menu and he was clearly frustrated and told them ""the menu is self explanatory "" it was kind of shocking especially to someone like me who doesn't like controversy, after that everyone was afraid to ask any more questions so they ordered their food and hoped for the best. We joined our friends there for a birthday celebration, everyone ordered Moscow mules and they came in glasses versus copper mugs (eye roll) , they also came lacking any ginger but was loaded with fruit juice. Aesthetically pleasing drinks, yes but not a mule. On to the food, the appetizers were again very aesthetically pleasing to the eye but average. The seared cheese was the best but we can do that at home for less. Now let's move to entrees, I had the baked spaghetti special and it was mediocre especially for the $22 price tag, but I ate it and was fine. The rest of the party ordered lamb... it came cold. ICE cold. We also ordered chicken meatballs, if you want to lose a tooth order those. All in all this is a place to go to for pita bread and a glass of wine w a cool atmosphere . Go somewhere else for dinner. Kefi is like dating someone really good looking but don't expect anything more, you are there for the looks."
kefi-knoxville,Camille D.,"Columbia, SC",1/3/2019,5.0,"What a beautiful addition to the Old City! I was very impressed with the gorgeous furniture and decor along with the bar, which is topped with a glittery granite. I had a bite and drink here at happy hour and was met with attentive service. They have excellent cocktail options and highlight that some come on tap so that the ingredients are able to mingle longer. The food is Greek/Mediterranean but is served Tapas style. Since I didn't come for a full meal, I only ordered one dish which was shrimp on crostini and covered in a decadent sauce. Overall, the food, drink, service and atmosphere were great."
kefi-knoxville,Blaine W.,"Indianapolis, IN",6/9/2019,5.0,"Great atmosphere and busy all night, got a seat in the waiting area that had couches and tables.  My party did small plates and some absolute winners were Spicy Feta dip, Beef Meatballs, and Fatayer-a stuffed pastry which can be found in every culture-this was a representation of the Middle East.  The loukouamades was a great dessert choice.  I will definitely come back to Kefi."
kefi-knoxville,Josh B.,"Knoxville, TN",7/6/2019,5.0,Everything on the menu is great. Go with a group and eat true tapas style. Order a little of everything from all corners of the menu. The roasted chicken and the  baba ganoush were stand outs. Drink flights are a must as well.
kefi-knoxville,David B.,"Knoxville, TN",11/14/2018,5.0,"I've lived in Knoxville for 8 years and the dining experience we had last weekend ranks in my top 3 for Knoxville. Incredible service began with the bartender asking what we liked, then surprising us with cocktails and a flaming cheese spread. Next we had a delicious shrimp spread and capped with fresh made donuts.  This restaurant will further enhance the uprise in fine dining around the Old City combined with Lonesome dove and Rebel Kitchen. A wonderfully unique experience I look forward to repeating again!"
kefi-knoxville,Suz L.,"San Francisco, CA",4/14/2019,5.0,"Wow. Octopodi was my favorite for the evening and this restaurant could have easily been in Nashville, San Francisco or any large foodie city."
kefi-knoxville,T S.,"Knoxville, TN",3/13/2019,3.0,"I really wanted to like Kefi (!!!!); most of my friends have raved about the restaurant...  but I was disappointed.   Is it that this Greek food is different from other Greek and Mediterranean food?  I just don't know.We started with two sure-fire dishes: Baba Ghannouj and Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves).  The first was pretty good; it was too garlicky for my dinner companion, but tht didn't bother me.  The dolmades was a clear miss!  The grape leaves were ""toothy"" (hard leaves, really?) and the rice was undercooked, not even al dente.   Usually grape leaves are created ahead of time, cooked, and allowed to marinade in olive oil; these certainly didn't spend much if any time in oil.We plunged on with fried Cauliflower (pretty good with dried cherries and hazelnuts) and Keftedes (meatballs with tzatziki).   The keftedes really didn't have much flavor; they seemed overcooked .A minor highlight was Loukoumades, a fried dough dessert.  It helped my companion to get rid of the earlier garlic.  It was okay, but still seemed slightly overcooked.I will come back and try again.  But if the food has not improved, I will reduce my rating."
kefi-knoxville,Stephanie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2/22/2019,5.0,"If I lived here, I'd be a regular. Absolutely terrific. Rivals any hip place in L.A. (where there's nothing quite like it). Sat at the bar. From the under-counter mounted USB ports and purse hooks at every barstool, to the inventive cocktails (pre-mixed and 'on draft' to allow the flavors to meld)..gorgeous libation presentation, whether a sliced aloe leaf or floating saffron strands, all were adorned with edible flowers..drinks have maximum visual impact. They're beautiful works of art. Bartenders are top notch, attentive, aware, make great recommendations. Food is superb, from flaming saganaki to moist souvlaki and house made tzaziki. Try the tyropita with a side of the fig jam..and thank your bartender for the tip."
kefi-knoxville,Lacy M.,"Orangeburg, SC",2/21/2019,5.0,"Absolutely incredible. From the moment you walk into the door, to your first (of many) cocktail, and then the food. Oh sweet Jesus the food. My husband and I were literally upset that we were full after just 3 plates that we couldn't order anything else. We had the mussels, a pasta special, and the cheese flambé. Had the cocktail flight which was awesome and then a couple beers. The service was phenomenal and it was surprisingly affordable. I thought it would be a 4x a year kind of place for us but it isn't at all. We had all that food and drink for $75. Large portions, not small plates. You HAVE to check this place out."
kefi-knoxville,Meghan P.,"TN, TN",2/21/2019,5.0,"Amazing addition to Knoxville! The food is delicious, and the creative cocktails are incredible. We've been twice and have loved every small plate and drink we've tried."
kefi-knoxville,Joseph K.,"Harleyville, SC",12/2/2018,5.0,Kefi is elegant. The food is outstanding. The staff is attentive. Servers are knowledgeable. Management is present and actively making sure we have a great experience. Great job to all!
kefi-knoxville,Sara F.,"New York, NY",12/28/2018,5.0,"I'm a New Yorker (from Astoria - a predominantly Greek neighborhood) who is pretty hard to please but this place was incredible. The food was fresh, incredibly tasty, and perfect portion for sharing. the cocktail menu was overwhelming in a good way and had tons of choices that I would like to go back and try. The decor was nice, but not pretentious. There were 3 of us and we got the tzatziki marinated olives, Greek salad, and the short ribs to share... all were amazing and we couldn't get enough. Our server Sam was also the absolute best! If I lived in Knox, I would be a regular without a doubt!"
kefi-knoxville,Keri B.,"New Orleans, LA",4/28/2019,5.0,"Delicious food, attentive service, and stylish ambiance. I look forward to going back! We shared the souvlaki and falafel, which was more than enough food for the two of us. The baklava was a hearty piece, with delicate, nuanced flavor."
kefi-knoxville,Kelly C.,"Anderson, IN",11/21/2018,5.0,This was a fantastic experience for the family and I. I could not recommend it more. Try the falafel and the hummus.

kefi-knoxville,Candace L.,"Asheville, NC",4/2/2019,5.0,"Truly, one of the most incredible dining experiences I've ever had. Not just in Knoxville, or recent memory. Kefi has an atmosphere that is nothing short of transportive. Gorgeous decor, ambient lighting...even the music was fabulous. The attention to detail was obvious in every facet of this restaurant. The seating was cozy, comfortable, and inviting (we sat in a far booth). The service we received was phenomenal. Our waiter, Thomas, was warm, personable, professional, and was happy to help us navigate the extensive menu. He offered suggestions but never came across as overbearing, and we were thrilled with what he recommended. I tried a flight of cocktails. Everything was lovely and fragrant but nothing was too overpowering or overwhelming. For dinner, we shared several dishes. Every item we ordered was perfectly prepared, and beautifully presented. The French press coffee with dessert was a wonderful touch.Most strikingly of all, I was more than pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices, and left fully content. I've been raving about my experience since this past Sunday, and eagerly anticipate a return visit."
kefi-knoxville,Mitch E.,"Washington, DC",3/19/2019,5.0,"Finally got to try this new place in the Old City and it was AWESOME!  Great atmosphere with wonderful seating and art all around.  Perfect cocktails and small bites of authentic Greek flavors. Spreads and bread were tasty, fried cheese did not disappoint, meatballs were good.  We will definitely be back to try more drinks and bites.  Loukamades (fried dough) for dessert were perfectly hot and crisp and dripping with honey."
kefi-knoxville,Stacy C.,"Cartersville, GA",12/29/2020,5.0,"This is our first time here. The menu while on a more appetizer/shared plan, is phenomenal. I ordered several dishes, a few of which were flaming. Every single thing I ordered was amazing. For the app we ordered the saga Ali (flaming). We ordered garides, voeio Kreis, and the paidaika for entrees. (Shrimp, waygu flank steak, and roasted lamb chops) everything was well prepared with a minimal wait time. Our server Kate was phenomenal at describing and explaining the menu. She was on time with all service needs. And if you aren't sure what to try she will happily tell you about every dish on the menu. She absolutely rocks! I also ordered dessert (flaming) sokolatenio Keith....o my god get in my belly!!!! I can not wait to come back any try this place out again! We weren't dressed like everyone else and it didn't matter we still got the same level of service! Y'all get over there and try this place out!"
kefi-knoxville,Dan A.,"Cookeville, TN",11/21/2018,5.0,"This is not your grand-mother's (yia-yia's) Greek restaurant. Everything is updated with a modern and classy twist. The cocktails are savory without being sour, the meze/tapas style servings are endlessly good, and the atmosphere is classy without dissing the Old City feel."
kefi-knoxville,Rachel S.,"Knoxville, TN",2/2/2019,5.0,Best restaurant in Knoxville!! The food is delicious and the drinks are phenomenal! Get the pasta or the short ribs and the old fashioned you'll thank me later I promise!

kefi-knoxville,Melanie B.,"San Diego, CA",12/13/2018,5.0,"Went to Kefi tonight after the grad school graduation and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of food, cocktails and service. Dan was our server and he did an excellent job of recommending delicious cocktails and desserts. I won't remember the name of everything we had but it was very yummy. The Fig smash and naked mezcal cocktails were strong and inventive. You can't ever go wrong with fried cheese and meat. The honey glazed donut holes for dessert were to die for. Can't wait to return after the holiday season when I'm back in town."
kefi-knoxville,Cara W.,"Knoxville, TN",1/21/2019,5.0,I went to Kefi last night as a first date. Wow. Such amazing decor and very cool. Our bartender phil was really helpful and told us about the menu and recommended a couple of dishes which turned out great. They have so many amazing cocktails on draft and while we didn't try them all phil would make themIn front of us so we could see what was going on. The food was amazing and although my date wasn't too good the bartenders kept us occupied when our conversation dried up. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Food is great and it's mezze style so you share small plates.
kefi-knoxville,M J.,"Boston, MA",1/2/2020,5.0,"Unfortunately I didn't get any pictures of our food because we were too eager to dig in. Kefi exceeded my expectations, and for a high-end experience really wasn't that expensive. We decided to go for dinner last minute and the host was able to fit us in for a reservation a few hours later and the server made great recommendations and coursed our food perfectly. The four of us shared the beef fatayar, halloumi, Keftedes, Pastitsio, Tyropita, and Garides and had a bit leftover. I'll also add that their old fashioned is perhaps the best I've enjoyed in Knoxville. I would highly recommend, especially for a cute date night- the bar is beautiful."
kefi-knoxville,Tyler B.,"Knoxville, TN",12/28/2019,5.0,"Amazing restaurant! Grab your friends for a break from life and relax over The Flight or grab your significant other and start with the Saginaki, an impressive display to start your time off with a flame! Follow that with the Kokinisto, this meal will remind you of home but blow your mind with the flavor and tenderness. Or perhaps you want to spice it up and bit and order the Pastitsio and peak your curiosity with the interesting flavors. Whatever the occasion or just to have a great meal, Kefi will never fail to impress."
kefi-knoxville,Frances G.,"Knoxville, TN",12/15/2018,5.0,"We had a table of 5 and every aspect of our meal went beyond expectations. I will admit, when I was looking at the menu earlier on in the day, I felt a little concerned because I didn't understand what half of the ingredients were on the drinks. Walked in impressed by the decor, but expecting a little above average food. Needless to say, Kefi definitely proved me wrong. We ordered a wide variety of dishes and I feel safe to say that it's hard to go wrong. Every single one was incredible. Unique, comforting flavors on every plate. The staff was excellent as well. Our server Thomas was attentive and a pleasure to talk to. The same goes for the bartenders tonight, whose names I didn't catch. Highly reccommend Kefi."

kefi-knoxville,Laura W.,"Townsend, TN",11/21/2018,4.0,"We were very excited to have an upscale Mediterranean restaurant nearby in Knoxville.  Our first visit prompted a reservation for a second, so obviously good things to report!We arrived quite early for our reservation the evening before Thanksgiving and were seated right away in a nice booth near the door.  We enjoyed people watching as folks came in with (& without) reservations, watching their reactions to the space.So...the space.  Beautiful, well designed, like nothing we've seen in Knoxville.  We were able to enjoy a conversation in the booth near the door without any problem.  Music was background-y, conversation was muted.  The fabrics on the booth and the chairs was lovely, the art on the walls very nice.  All in all, 5 stars.Service started a little rough, our server didn't know what an element of one of the cocktails was (monkey shoulders - a high end scotch).  But she found the owner who not only told us about the scotch, but sat down and explained the entire concept of the cocktail menu to us and then offered a sample of the ""Penicillin.""  We're not scotch drinkers, but dang, it was tasty!  We'll definitely go back and sample a few others.  Interestingly, our first server was replaced by a new server and service improved.  With our new service, service was casual but not slow,  efficient but not rushed.  Service started at a ""2"" and quickly elevated to a ""5.""Food was the star tonight.  Started with Baba Ghannoug, nice & garlicky with pita and a couple of flatbreads.  Maybe a little more salt, but otherwise, very tasty.  Then, on to the Garides (shrimp), nice whole shrimp on crostini with a bit of tomato and feta and a yummy smoky tomato sauce.  A couple more crostini to clean up the sauce would have been great!We then shared the Pastitio, kind of a Greek mac & cheese with beef.  Great comfort food on a cold early winter night.  Slight hint of cinnamon and nutmeg, perfect seasoning and a portion for 4.  Or two with leftovers for Black Friday!Dessert was Baklava and the pistachio ice cream, large portion with half to take home.  Good, passable but not sure I'd burn the calories for it again.We do have return reservations for a few weeks from now, looking forward to trying more of the cocktails (in sample size) and more of the mezze.Happy to have Kefi in Ktown!"
