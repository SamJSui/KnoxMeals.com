stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jason B.,"New York, NY",8/15/2022,5.0,Great food great drinks awesome staff. I had the hurt locker and the toppings which were numerous were tastefully minimal but all there. On my list for Knoxville!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Dave D.,"Rochester, MI",4/18/2022,5.0,"I stopped in Knoxville on a solo drive back to Michigan from Florida.  After 12 hours of driving, I was looking for a place where I could have a decent casual meal and a drink or two.  Other Yelp reviews caused me to pick this place.  I was lucky enough to grab a seat at the bar on a very crowded Friday night.  Lucky for me Sophie G. was tending bar that night and she made for a very pleasant evening.  She was friendly and approachable, as well as very knowledgeable about local craft beers and cocktail options.  She made me a couple great cocktails, including a recipe I provided.  She is a real asset to this restaurant.  Food wise, the salmon sandwich I ordered was also great, and the burgers I saw looked quite tasty.  If you are a burger person, this place would be a great fit.I'll definitely return if I'm lucky enough to be in Knoxville in the future, and hopefully Sophie will still be tending bar."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Nicolle M.,"Boston, MA",8/22/2022,3.0,"Food quality isn't what it used to be. I was in town visiting Knoxville and figured I would go back to the old stomping ground of Stock and Barrel. I used to work in Market Square so I used to go to Stock & Barrel pretty frequently. The food wasn't as good as it used to be overall. The portions were still very generous and it's always a nice ambiance!! Village Tomato Salad -- This was the highlight of my meal! The salad is a perfectly orchestrated concoction of the right flavors and vegetables  coming together. The tomatoes, olives, feta, and onions are all great quality and feel fresh. You have to give this a try if you go in!! The Mother Clucker -- The sandwich was overall pretty under seasoned, and the garlic aioli was really trying to pull it all together but it fell short. The fries were a bit soggy, but still totally fine. Appreciated the amount of food, but we weren't too impressed.The Billy -- This sweet and salty burger wasn't for me. The meat wasn't flavorful and the quality wasn't great. The mix of the onions and tomato jam didn't mesh perfectly well in my opinion, but my friend who tried it really loved it. So while the toppings might not be for me, they might work well for you!I probably wouldn't go again, but it is undeniably a Market Square staple!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Mrs J P.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",7/2/2022,1.0,"Food was ok, however the staff extremely immature and not attentive at all looked like a bunch of college kids lol, our waitress forgot a few things  like drink refils, she saw that but we had to ask once she returned, she forgot some food items so again we had to ask, when our waitress disappeared for a bit and she finally came back we had asked for our check snd waited on that, she also left our original empty drink glasses and as you know if you've been there some tables are small.Even the couple next to us, were complaining about there waitress who also disappeared on them as well lol Will we come back maybe but a different day and not on a Saturday night"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Michael B.,"Dayton, OH",6/13/2022,2.0,"The ambiance is great and the staff is good, especially the hostess. Drinks are pretty good as well. Unfortunately, it ends there. The food is subpar. All the hamburgers are over cooked. Well done when ordered medium. The buns on the burgers are not great. The billy burger comes with tomato jam. Good idea, but too sweet. It should be a Smokey tomato jam. Onions need to be more caramelized.The duck fat fries are overly soggy. Fried pickles are okay and the regular fries are good when you add salt.  Has potential, just needs a little focus on the details of the menu. Maybe it has lost something since it's opening."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jeanette C.,"Knoxville, TN",8/18/2022,4.0,"My husband was craving a burger, so we came to Stock & Barrel. The burgers were huge and delicious! I thought my Greek Burger was better than The Bernie that my husband picked. The Greek Burger has a lamb patty with Kasseri cheese, tzatziki, greens, tomato, and bourbon onions. The flavor reminded me of eating a gyro, but in burger form. It was sooo tasty that I ate the burger the next day straight from the fridge (or, I was that hungry, haha)! The fries and onions rings were also great! You could tell they were made fresh with fresh ingredients. Next time, I want to try their crab dip and fried green tomatoes."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Hanna L.,"Christiana, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,So yummy! I got the Ring of Fire burger with regular fries and my husband got the Bison with duck fat fries. Both were delicious and the portions were huge! Neither of us was able to finish our meal. The garlic aioli sauce was delicious and I kept dipping my fries and burger in it. The Ring of Fire burger was definitely spicy (perfect for me but don't get it if you're sensitive to that stuff) and the Bison burger was delicious.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,M M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",9/8/2022,4.0,"Solid. Similar to Crow burger in Newport beach. Overpriced, but everything seems to be here."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Jacob N.,"Dayton, OH",7/22/2022,5.0,"My friend and I tried this place out while visiting Knoxville. Absolutely amazing! It was pretty busy but we were still seated right away. Our waiter was prompt and efficient and our drinks never ran dry!  The burgers came out fresh from the grill, still hot and juicy! The prices here were extremely reasonable as well. I 100% recommend this place!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Susan L.,"North Ridgeville, OH",7/10/2022,3.0,"Stopped into Stock and Barrel on our one night trip to Knoxville. It had good Yelp reviews and my husband is a Bourbon fan. The food was excellent!  Very large portions and all delicious. Great choices for some interesting burgers. The service was fine for a busy Saturday night. This is getting a 3 because of the restrooms, which happened to be unisex. They were beyond atrocious.  The gas station we stopped at during our travel had cleaner facilities.  This was not just because it was busy kind of dirty. Honestly it made me nervous as the whole cleanliness of the place came into question. They were that bad.  But the food and bourbon were really good."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Gretchen R.,"Needham, IN",12/7/2016,5.0,"9 times out of 10, I will choose chicken over beef. I don't know why...but I do. Except here. I cannot get enough beef here. I have had dreams about their burgers and don't get me started on their fries. Southern food is heavenly but this restaurant is doing something different. Some of the best burgers in town with an amazing environment. I don't think this is a group friendly place, small seating areas and tables but just grab your favorite two friends and chow down on some burgers."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Crazy G.,"Knoxville, TN",1/21/2017,4.0,This place was great! Id have given 5 stars if my food was a bigger portion(seemed a bit small) but it was amazing!
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Sarah P.,"Detroit, MI",1/20/2015,5.0,This place is delectable! Go for the whiskey flight so you can try several at a time. Then when you pair that with one of their amazing burgers...perfection. I highly recommend the mushrooms appetizer. An excellent balance of sweet honey on fried mushrooms and a side of mustard. I went for the bison which was served with duck confit fries. Burger was great. Fries were decent but Needed more duck. Good flavor though. An excellent find in Knoxville.
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Olivia P.,"Knoxville, TN",3/31/2019,5.0,Awesome burgers! Just wish they had another location. We don't go often anymore because it's just so busy! But the food is outstanding
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Shu T.,"Taipei, Taiwan",12/18/2016,4.0,"Came here for lunch and I ordered ""the Greek"" burger. It was delicious and had great sauce. My bf ordered a Kentucky bourbon ale, which didn't have that strong of a bourbon taste and wasn't too bitter. The atmosphere is chill and service was good. Burgers aren't cheap, but it was worth it. I thought the duck confit fries was just ok. Probably wouldn't get them again."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Ross M.,"Knoxville, TN",9/19/2016,5.0,Stock and Barrel has a great selection of food and drinks. It is constantly busy which speaks for itself
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Valerie N.,"Atlanta, GA",2/9/2014,1.0,"I was ecstatic to try Stock and Barrel after my friend recommended it for a First Friday downtown. See, I'm from Knoxville originally and never seem to get downtown when I come home to visit the fam. After looking at the menu  (yay! Locally sourced!) and reading yelp reviews, I knew I would have a terrific, fun meal there... And perhaps wait a bit for it. We got to Stock and Barrel later than we meant to - and the whole walk there, I marveled at the Market Square I barely recognized. We checked in a bit after 7pm and were told it would be an hour to 1.5 hours max, but they were sure they would seat us. We left our name, they promised to text, and so began our walk around the square and a visit to downtown grill to wait, seeing as there was absolutely positively no place to wait inside Stock and Barrel. At an hour and 20 minutes (with no text), we walked back so we would hit the 1.5 hour mark on the nose. Imagine my utter shock when they told me it would be at least another hour (I.e. Seated after 10pm), if we were even seated. My mouth dropped open. The hostess rudely swung around the iPad to show the long list of names ahead of us and began pointing at just how many tables would be seated before we ever would be. I also noticed the time of 90+ minutes next to our name. Then she essentially folded her arms and stared us down. Um, hi? That's it? No apology? At all?  No, ""sorry we didn't text an update to let you know..."" No, ""gosh it's way busier tonight than we expected - maybe we can give you a 25% off coupon to come back another time?"" Where was the manager and/or owner who should have realized the disaster going down at the hostess stand and been there to soothe the stressed (potential) clientele?Listen: I knew ponying up to this place at 7ish on a First Friday was risky but how/why could a place that's been open for months be so waaaay off in calculating table turnover that they mistook an hour wait for a 2.5+ hours wait, and then not apologize at all for the error?Luckily I wasn't that hungry so I wasn't hangry enough to make a scene but I'm sure someone before or after me did. It's no way to do business, especially when OpenTable and other online reservation systems exist (not to mention the old-fashioned system of call ahead). I reallllllllly wanted to patron Stock and Barrel, but even Thomas Keller and the French Laundry didn't make me wait 2.5+ hours to eat his amazing food. I'm not sure how many customers S&B lost Friday night but I guarantee had S&B had a reservations system that told me it was fully booked, I would have shrugged my shoulders and tried it another time. Instead, thanks to making me spend 1.5 hours of my Friday in a hold pattern and then subjecting me to a super apathetic hostess, I won't be back (and gosh, if the hostess stand is that unpleasant, what's the wait staff like???).For this, I must leave one star. I spent enough time with you that would warrant a normal meal time, S&B. I must also add that my burger craving was satiated right down the road, via my patty melt and Mac & cheese that I was quickly served after being promptly seated at the Bijou was AMAZING. And there was live jazz. Thank goodness for them for giving me the awesome First Friday experience Knoxvillians deserve!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Missy E.,"Yorktown, VA",2/8/2017,5.0,"In town from VA for a volleyball tourney and chose this place off of their reviews. All we (table of 6) could say was WOW! We had tried the mushrooms as an appetizer---great portion to share and feed all 6 of us, Chicken sandwiches, burgers, salad with salmon burger, and chicken tenders (that were not on the menu but they accommodated our picky ""only eats chicken tenders"" friend). Waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable of the area (she pointed us in the direction of a spirits store..BONUS). Everything was AMAZING and Thank You!"
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Katie R.,"Atlanta, GA",2/26/2014,5.0,"I had my first experience here four days ago but it's still fresh in my mind as the best dinner I have had since I moved to Knoxville.The host said the wait was an hour long when I arrived with my date. There was no hesitation to add us to the waiting list via the hype my roommate gave me when he suggested this spot earlier. Since this was in Market Square it wouldn't be hard to find other places to hang out until our table was ready. We walked down to Soccer Taco to watch a game while I enjoyed a couple whiskey diets, my usual drink. We returned shortly before the hour mark. The host is supposed to text you when your table is ready. I like this feature because it doesn't involve a clunky disc device that you need to hold nor do you have to wait for your name to be called. I asked the host if we could be seated even though we did not receive a text notification yet and a couple minutes later we had the perfect table.I can't seem to remember our waiters name but he was fantastic. Very attentive and fun to be around. From an outsiders view it might look like I knew this guy personally by how friendly he was.I had the pleasure of enjoying a drink that I eyed on the specials menu when I walked in. I saw the words Makers Mark and muddled strawberries and was sold instantly. When you have the selection of over 50 different bourbons you're going to have a very excited Katie. They even had Four Roses which is an US export only liquor unless purchased directly from the distillery in Louisville. So awesome.Our waiter talked up the Elk meat as a prime choice for whichever burger we selected. I never had it before so I trusted his suggestion. The thing is that now I have a very bad problem. I'm in love with Elk meat. I want it on every burger for the rest of my life until I die. Not only did I have delicious medium rare meat for my mouth to enjoy but it's healthy too. This restaurant works with a local farm in Blaine, TN for their grass fed, hormone free delectables. For a fitness health nut like myself.. This is perfect for my food source preferences. The only thing that could possibly make this any more beautiful would be peanut butter.. Oh but wait what's this? A slice of peanut butter pie for dessert? I don't care how happy my tummy already is at this point please give this to me NOW. And so my date and I shared a happy ending together while I decided that this was in fact my new favorite restaurant in Knoxville. The end."
stock-and-barrel-knoxville,Alison B.,"Fairfield, OH",6/7/2017,4.0,"Very good service.  All of us had burgers and were pleased.  But,  order a doneness level up from your usual.  All were a little more pink than we preferred.  Fries are seasoned which didn't make the kids happy."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Colleen R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/28/2022,5.0,"I am going to be able to make it through the rest of my work day because I'll be riding the high that was lunch at Farmacy.  Key to getting a table without a wait at lunch is to roll in there by 11:45 am, although i'd say the restaurant was probably 75% full even at that time. Farmacy could be the poster child for Southern farm to table cuisine and style.  The dining room is adorable, fresh, arty, a little quirky, and very cozy and comfortable.  Many menu items are locally sourced.  The offerings aren't fussy, and there aren't a million things to chose from which means what they serve, they prepare with care.Three of us all ordered the same thing: Thursday's special which was a Springer Mountain Chicken baked Enchilada with green salsa served with jalapeño pinto and black beans.   The beans had a perfect combo of sweet and heat, and it was wonderful diving into a plate of enchiladas that aren't drowning in a mystery sauce.  The chicken was tender and flavorful, cheese was hot and melty, and the tortillas were crisp and not a bit soggy.  As we walked out of Farmacy, my coworker remarked that this is a meal that is going to stick in her memory banks. We will definitely make a point of coming back on a Thursday again soon!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rebecca A.,"Knoxville, TN",7/26/2022,5.0,Amazing!  Thank you so much!  Atmosphere...excellent!Food...excellent!Thank you for making sure there was no cross contamination and offering GF options!  It is so hard to go out to eat and find places that actually have GF buns and then will continue to take care of their customers who are GF and celiac disease!  The food was superb!  I ate all of the sandwich...Minus the 2nd half of the bun which got a little soggy on the bottom ...which was no big deal!I can't wait to go back!!!They also were very accommodating with our seating.  We were seated in a noisy section and it was a little loud for me and they gladly moved us to a much quieter section...excellent!Our server was very knowledgeable of all things Gluten-free!Thank you!We will be Back!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Daryl J.,"Downtown, Knoxville, TN",6/19/2022,4.0,"First the restaurant is owned and primarily operated by women which is a huge plus and rarity. They were very welcoming and nice. We went during brunch/Father's Day  and the wait was only an hour. The chicken and waffles were a hit. Waffle were flavored and cooked perfectly. I recommend the bright side bowl or the cure all burger. Many of their food items are local.  The drink menu is HUGE. There is also LIVE music. This place definitely pass the vibes check. Reasons I don't give it 5 stars  1. No mixed coffee drinks period  such as a latte or cappuccino. 2. The parking was also  insane. I'd avoid later brunch hours and holiday next time. 3. Make note the brunch menu is strict and any modifications of brunch menu are limited or surcharge Overall, I highly recommend and will try again."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Micah D.,"Murfreesboro, TN",8/10/2022,5.0,"This wonderful local restaurant is the elevation of food that Knoxville needs! Walking in you are greeted by friendly smiles and beautiful decor. I couldn't get over the cute little details all around. Everyone who served us was very accommodating. The menu is full of tempting dishes. It was so hard to choose. I started with a blueberry mule. Delicious! The syrups are made in house! The seasonal burrata appetizer with ceviche shrimp was absolutely my favorite part of the meal. So many flavors that just combine perfectly. My main dish was the cure-all salmon sandwich. Huge piece of salmon beautifully seasoned with cured onion, avocado, and jalapeno aioli. It came with a plentiful side of fries. I wish I had room for dessert because the sweets menu looked so good. I will be back. Maybe Friday for the lobster rolls..."
farmacy-knoxville-2,Rachyl D.,"Charleston, SC",7/22/2022,5.0,"We stopped here as a last minute lunch on our way out of town and I'm so glad we did! It was the best food we ate on our entire trip in Knoxville! The soup and the bowls were so good, and one person in our group said the potato salad was the best she ever had! A little out of the way but worth it!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Yvonne L.,"Washington, DC",7/14/2022,4.0,"Super cute brunch spot with high portion sizes. The vibe and decor is on point and the patio is really nice too. The chicken and waffles was tasty and the drinks were nice as well. Only thing that could be improved is service. It was a bit on the slow side. But all in all, good experience here!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Lauren C.,"Dayton, OH",7/3/2022,5.0,"I'm a pharmacist and nutritionist myself so the name ""Farmacy"" definitely spoke to me! Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Made a reservation online through Google because it is usually packed. Our table of three sat in a the cute little circle booth. Food was amazing! So fresh and vibrant! I had the Empowered Bowl with arugula, sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, radishes, and chopped grilled salmon with the honey jalapeño vinaigrette. Definitely will come back if I'm in town again!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Sarah M.,"Memphis, TN",8/18/2022,4.0,Great brunch options - something on the menu for everyone! Great cocktails too - try the peach Bellini!
farmacy-knoxville-2,Gretel Y.,"Gilbert, AZ",2/7/2022,5.0,"My son and I were in town for a meet and stayed at a hotel nearby. We were only in town for a couple of days and wanted a really good brunch. Did a quick Yelp search and got excited when I saw how close Farmacy was!We arrived around 11:30 AM on a Saturday and were greeted immediately upon entering. The place was busy, but to our surprise, we were seated right away. Farmacy is a good example of ""don't judge a book by its cover."" The outside doesn't look like much. The space was bright and beautiful. Plenty of seating.It didn't take us long to decide on what to get:CoffeePeach teaBeignetsVitality bowl Avocado toastWe love to start (and/or end) with something sweet and the beignets fit the bill. One order came with three huge beignets generously covered in powdered sugar and a side of raspberry honey. They were wonderful! I chose the vitality bowl for me entree. It comes with corn, black beans, hash, avocado, tomato, feta, radish, red onion, sprouts, grilled chicken, and a fried egg on a bed of arugula. I asked for no chicken. Filling and flavorful. My son got the avocado toast. Came with thick cut Flourhead multigrain bread covered in smashed avocado, topped with thick cut tomato, lemon, cured onion, feta and radish. Served with a side of eggs. It was the most beautiful, vibrant avocado toast I have ever seen! Very tasty, too.We had an excellent meal and experience at Farmacy. Highly recommend!"
farmacy-knoxville-2,Adriana F.,"Sparta Township, NJ",7/27/2022,4.0,"We came to Farmacy to have a celebratory dinner with our realtor after purchasing our first home. I right away loved the airy and vibrant ambiance of the main room. All of the rooms are adorned with pretty plants and are Instagram worthy. There is also an enclosed dining room for private parties/events. Our table of four split the cornbread appetizer, which comes out in this adorable cast iron dish and is served with finger-licking good honey butter. Needless to say, the cornbread was enjoyed in minutes by all of us, and I highly recommend it as something light to start with. For our entrees, my husband had the brisket plate and I had the maple pecan salmon. The brisket is from Painted Hills and is slow cooked for 12 hours. It literally melts in your mouth!! It's served with green beans and over smashed red potatoes with a side of their house tomato jam. When I tasted my husband's brisket, I almost wished I had ordered that instead of my salmon. My Chilean salmon with its sweet maple pecan glaze came with green beans and smashed sweet potatoes but was a little underwhelming. The salmon was cooked a little too long and was dried out when I went to taste it, whereas my green beans were entirely undercooked. That is the sole reason for one less star in my review. All in all, I would recommend Farmacy for their unique southern fare. I look forward to giving them another try and getting that mouthwatering Brisket Plate next time around."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Michael R.,"Cary, NC",7/23/2022,5.0,Freaking amazing. Will be back every visit to Knoxville. Food and atmosphere are both next level. And the cocktails...
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Thomas T.,"Northfield, IL",7/18/2022,5.0,"Oysters in Tennessee?! Heck, yeah!  This place is amazing!  The shuckers and great oysters make it so. If you like oysters, a great atmosphere, and just generally good conversation about oysters you should not miss this place."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,John M.,"Maryville, TN",8/18/2022,5.0,"We were joined here by friends for dinner and ended just working our way through the hot and cold apps until we couldn't eat anything else. Never made it to entrees or desserts. The various oysters that made up our 2 1/2 dozen were wonderful. My personal favorite were the Savage Blonde from PEI. The Oyster's Rockefeller were  exceptional and unlike any I've previously enjoyed. Rounding out the oyster portion of the evening were Oyster Shooters (a first for me). These could be dangerous they go down so easily. Among other incredible apps were the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Lobster Dip with Shrimp Chips. Our server, Fallon, was a delight. She kept a watchful eye on our glasses and plates. Additionally, she was very knowledgeable, answering all of our questions. Can't for our next visit, maybe we'll start with the entrées."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Colleen R.,"Knoxville, TN",7/31/2022,5.0,"My friend and I met for an early reservation on a Saturday night. It's not a large restaurant, so reservations via Resy are a must.  We were seated right away at a cozy two-top table/booth, and the server was ready to review their specific oyster menu with us. We saved her the trouble there, we ain't oyster people, but if you are then you'll need to check this place out and then let me know what you think!They have several signature cocktails on the menu, and by GOD if you're going to list a martini then I'm going to get one. Ketel one, dirty, with whipped blue cheese stuffed olives this drink was GLORIOUS. And to top it off their bar ware is just lovely. My friend ordered the Living on a Pear, she enjoyed it although she did think it was a bit on the sweet side.We split two appetizers - the whipped feta and the smoked fish dip.  Both delicious but let me just do you a solid and say you HAVE to order the whipped feta. Creamy with a hint of heat and sweet, served with grilled sour dough bread LAWDHAVEMERCY. Since both of the apps were pretty sizable an each served with bread, we ordered small for our entrees. I had the Spanish grilled octopus - it was petite and lovely, not chewy. It had a nice flavor although nothing over the top. Served on a plate of puréed white bean, which was also tasty, but I didn't necessarily think the two related to one another. That said i'd still order it again.  My friend had the chilled shrimp and loved them.  When we left around 8:00 the restaurant was packed. Our server was adorable and she did an outstanding job.  I'll be back Brass Pearl - my 14 year old is def gonna want to try your mussels!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Mike And Nita B.,"Bettendorf, IA",5/5/2022,5.0,The shrimp and grits were excellent and worth the visit just for that.  Also enjoyed the Lobster Bisque.Nice ambiance and fast friendly service.Next time to Knoxville I would make it a point to eat here again!
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,JH C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",8/27/2022,5.0,This place is just a top notch! Our server Jake was very nice and wonderful!All the food on menu sounded so good and three of us tried few which turned out to be all very delicious and quality was excellent!  Very satisfying dinner we had tonight.
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Jared M.,"Knoxville, TN",3/5/2022,5.0,"Was so glad to get to go on the opening weekend!- Oyster bar was fresh and tried two of them all (plus a couple more).- Venue looks really nice with good touches. - Food came out fresh and tasted amazing!Agree on reviews talking about prices, but do go give it a chance! Will definitely be back."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Macy D.,"TN, TN",5/16/2022,5.0,"This place is such a neat little addition to Market Square! We went to celebrate an anniversary and loved our experience. Since it's pretty new, it was very crowded and I would definitely recommend making a reservation. The drinks are unique, and we really enjoyed the crab dip as an appetizer. The lobster mac and cheese was very creamy and filling- enough to take home for sure. The fish and chips were my favorite! Well battered and the sauce they give you with it in addition to the tartar sauce was very tasty. The maritime decor and atmosphere is super fun and different than anything in the area. It is a narrow and relatively small restaurant, so be expecting to sit very close to your neighbors especially if you go on a weekend! Would love to go back and try some different things on the menu."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Chris O.,"Knoxville, TN",4/22/2022,5.0,"Updated to add:Still 5 stars. Have not had anything regrettable here. Was able to try to feta dip now and although it's good, the lobster dip is still my favorite. Fried oysters were a bit on the spicy side but a nice starter. Oysters Rockafeller didn't disappoint if you're like me and can't do plain raw oysters. If you ask for bread, they have what tasted like charred sourdough. Great with the bisque.Tried chocolate cake and crème brûlée cheesecake and would definitely take the cheesecake over the chocolate. G&T is listed as seaweed infused but it is very subtle if at all noticeable. Tasted like a basic gin and tonic to me! I have been trying to taste some of the other items on the menu but can't get past the specials they offer. Had amazing snapper the last time and the most recent visit got the swordfish - which I wish was a regular menu feature.Can't stop won't stop!"
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Chris O.,"Knoxville, TN",3/17/2022,5.0,"Thrilled I get to award this place 5 stars!! It was the perfect date night and we were impressed with everything: drinks, food, atmosphere and service. Can't wait to go back and try everything we missed.Brass Pearl reminds me of a place in New York - very narrow and extending far back with cozy booths next to each other. The octopus chandelier was my favorite part of the decor. Music playing was classic rock with Gimme Shelter vibes.Salt Bae was a DELICIOUS cocktail. And was a generous portion in a tall glass with a cute umbrella. Also tried the whipped blue cheese stuffed olive dirty martini and it was executed perfectly. Lobster dip - would definitely get this again. The crackers and cheesy dip were the perfect pair. Lobster bisque - really good. More on the creamy side with great flavor. Kale Caesar Salad - such a unique combination that just works. The sardines at the top were a little daunting but I thought it was dressed evenly and was a generous portion. Steak Frites - hard to go wrong with a steak and fries: especially when it comes with fried onions on top. Aioli dip was good too but a little on the salty side. Lobster Mac and Cheese - a great dish. Exactly what you'd expect. Lumps weren't especially big but definitely flavorful. Pasta was orecchiette shaped and it was a tad on the spicy side but not overwhelmingly so. Felt a bit guilty not ordering oysters so the plan for our next visit will include oysters Rockafeller, Pearl salad and key lime pie or the crème brûlée cheesecake. Great that they take reservations too. Can't wait for next time."
the-brass-pearl-knoxville,Charlie H.,"Knoxville, TN",7/23/2022,5.0,"We had a great dinner of oysters, octopus, lobster dip, lobster Mac and cheese and fish and chips.  Oysters were ice cold, octopus cooked to perfection,  fish and chips best in Knoxville! Service was great!!!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jenifer F.,"Knoxville, TN",8/23/2022,5.0,"We've been here a dozen times or more and it's always great. The pork belly fried rice is my favorite but sometimes I have to have the chef's special of the night.The pork egg rolls are also a taste explosion. The outdoor patio is HUGE and it's hidden from the street almost completely.Lots of Knoxville charm and incredibly good food. Oh, and their drink specials never disappoint.Choose this place, you'll not regret it."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Jessica S.,"TN, TN",9/2/2022,3.0,"This place has been recommended to me since 2018, I finally went and unfortunately have to agree with the other reviews regarding price point and general satisfaction with the food.Pros-The ambiance is very modern, cute, and quirky. Fun wallpaper and a dark interior and optional outdoor seating if weather permits. Friendly service. Bao/buns were excellent, if I ever came back I'd just stick to those. The pork belly one and the eggplant one were just as good as everyone said they would be.Cons- I can't come back for this price point. The pork belly fried rice was presented beautifully, but this dish was 80% rice. You can't charge $18 for 80% rice which costs actual mere cents and not even mix pieces of pork belly into the rice. The pork belly and other toppings were delicious, but not enough to justify this pricing."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Anwesh D.,"Memphis, TN",6/15/2022,4.0,"After hearing great things about the place, I decided to try Kaizen. The steamed buns were small but very delicious. I would recommend getting multiple orders to try out the different varieties.The Pad Thai, the fried rice were also solid entrees. Overall, definitely the best Asian restaurant in Knoxville. Worth a try!"
kaizen-knoxville-2,Alex L.,"Las Vegas, NV",5/13/2022,4.0,"When I was eating there, I thought hmm it's not bad, but not sure if it's like good as I was told. But after a day I found myself wanting to eat here again! P.S. The portions are deceivingly large."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Valerie U.,"Placerville, CA",8/4/2022,3.0,"Not kid friendly. They sat us outside and gave my 3 yr old a drink in a glass. Nothing on the menu is kid friendly, unless your kid loves spicy food. My daughter ate steamed rice. Our food was delicious, but service was slow so we didn't see our server until she was bringing the check. No refills or extra napkins."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Luke S.,"Clinton, TN",8/19/2022,5.0,"Arguably Knoxvilles best restaurant based on the food quality, variety, and freshness.   Wait staff are pretty good.   Come for the food."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Matthew L.,"Central, SC",8/11/2022,5.0,Food was great. I had the crispy beef dish and my wife had the shrimp bowl. Service could have been better.
kaizen-knoxville-2,Thuy Lan N.,"Knoxville, TN",3/2/2022,4.0,"Great vibes.Sat on the patio with cute string lights and a cool, clean alley feel. The food was pretty reasonably priced and relatively delicious. Some items were really hit or miss though. The dumplings, yummy. The braised potatoes we had- wayyyy too salty sitting in a pool of soy sauce/tamari. The dry fry eggplant is a MUST. Crispy, tingly, well spiced, so good. The Dan Dan noodles we knew were served cold- expected them cool but not straight out of the fridge cold. The mapo tofu is definitely not standard- both mapo and Dan Dan are known for being saucy dishes authentically but both dishes were served saucless.The mapo had dry black beans on top and no sauce which made it not the most pleasant eating experience, although the flavors did have good depth and tingle from the sichuan peppercorns."
kaizen-knoxville-2,Matt R.,"Knoxville, TN",1/15/2022,5.0,"Amazing experience! This was the first time that my boyfriend and I went to Kaizen. Our experience was fantastic as the service was fast and the vibe of the whole restaurant was on point. The food we ordered was all hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious! We sat at the bar, even though some tables were still open when we got there around 5 on a Friday. The bartenders are very quick to serve us and helped a lot in our decision making of what to order for food and drinks. We will definitely be coming back again to try out many more of the menu items, since they all looked delicious. The place filled up fast after we got there so make plans to get there early! Would absolutely recommend for anyone in the area to try out."
kaizen-knoxville-2,John H.,"New York, NY",6/28/2021,4.0,The eggplant is all she wrote.  It is like eating fries on crack.  Great seasoning (five-spice with anise coming through).  CRISPY!  I had better Dan Dan noodles elsewhere  but it was still good.  It was drier than other versions I've had.  Evenings can get quite busy.  Also it can be a noisy spot.
